which we miss key signals, both good and bad in relationships,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=58"

their present circumstances overrides their willingness to move forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=92"

how you can be happier in or out of a relationship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.040</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=114"

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Laurie Gottlieb, welcome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Great to be here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.300</a></span> | <span class="t">What's the first thing you ask a patient when you're meeting them for the first time?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Usually it's something like, tell me what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Tell me why you're here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Tell me what made you decide to come in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And are you listening both to the content of their words and their tone, their physicality?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's so interesting, because sometimes people will say, I'm here because of, and they'll talk about something very difficult, but they're smiling through it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I think it's very nerve-wracking to come in and see a therapist, and you don't know this person, and you're about to share some very personal information that maybe you haven't told anyone in this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you want to make somebody comfortable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to make sure that, you know, you feel like they are not being rushed to share something that they're not ready to share.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's just the process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's a very human interaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, therapy to me is not like expert and this other person, and then it feels very asymmetrical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course, we're using our training, and that's why they're coming to us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But I feel like it's very much a human-to-human interchange.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you think, because I've heard, but I don't know if it's true, do you think that some people tend to create a lot of internal and perhaps external narrative about what happened, who they are, how people are in the world, how they're not in the world?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, a lot of words to their experience, either spoken or internally, versus people who maybe experience life a little bit differently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Once somebody said in a comment on Instagram, and I still think about this, they said, I don't think in words, I think in feels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And my first reaction was like, yeah, I'm from Northern California, and people talk that way sometimes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So I thought, that's interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe there are a lot of people who, for whom language isn't the primary mode of understanding what's going on around them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that as humans, we try to make sense of our feelings through stories, that we tell ourself a story about why we're feeling a certain way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes we aren't that skilled, because nobody taught us this, to access our feelings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And that happens because kids are often talked out of their feelings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you're young, for example, and say you say to your parent, I'm really worried about this, and your parent will say, oh, don't worry about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.300</a></span> | <span class="t">That's nothing to worry about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Or I'm really mad about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">You're so sensitive, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Or because parents are really uncomfortable when their kids are feeling sad because they feel like it's my responsibility to make sure they're not sad, which is not your responsibility as a parent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">You're there to sit with your child and be present for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So if your child says, I'm really sad that so-and-so sat with so-and-so at lunch today, and, you know, the parent will say, well, here's what you can do, or that's terrible, or, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead of like, oh, tell me more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that as a parent or even as a partner, when your partner comes to you or your friend comes to you or a family member comes to you and tells you something, often what we do is we try to talk them out of the feeling that they're having or help them get rid of the feeling because we think it's a negative feeling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">When feelings are all positive because they're like a compass, they tell us what direction to go in if we can access them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you say to someone, tell me more, then the kid might say, well, yeah, it was really hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they'll talk about maybe like why the person might have sat at a different table or what might have happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And we really do have a lot of answers inside if we listen to the feelings, but we're talked out of the feelings, and then we grow up thinking, if I'm feeling sad or angry or anxious, then, you know, I need to get rid of the feeling as opposed to I need to use that feeling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so instead what we do is we come up with all these stories like the problem is out there as opposed to, oh, I have some really good information in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I had a now ex-girlfriend, and we're still on great terms, who we had an agreement that served us super well and that I try and apply going forward, which is nobody tries to shift anyone else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.460</a></span> | <span class="t">In my mind, I was the one that came up with that, but I think in reality she was the one that came up with it because now I'm like, there's no way I would have come up with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think it came about through a couple different interactions where I would get off work and sometimes like the initial 20 minutes of interacting was much more difficult than it needed to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I remember we just came up with this plan where we just decide no one's going to shift the other person unless they're like, shift me, please, you know, like help me relax or help me get excited about this, which we would never do, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So a policy of not trying to shift anybody or somebody trying to shift our emotions I think felt really liberating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I think what you're talking about is self-regulation versus co-regulation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So self-regulation is when you're having some kind of internal experience, you have choices like I'm really angry about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.540</a></span> | <span class="t">How do I self-regulate not to ignore the anger because the anger is telling me that maybe a boundary was broken or maybe somebody is treating me in a way that I don't want to be treated or maybe I'm upset with myself for the way that I acted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's good information, but then what do you do with it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you self-regulate?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you find ways to look at the anger without screaming, yelling, self-sabotaging, whatever people do that's not a productive use of their anger or your anxiety or your sadness?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Co-regulation is important though.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's something that you see, again, you can see it with parent-child where if the parent can stay calm when the child is not calm, that helps the child to learn to self-regulate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And with a partner, like say you had a really hard day at work and you come home and you're just not in a good mood, it's not your partner's responsibility to help you through that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to self-regulate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But it sure helps if your partner is regulated and they can help co-regulate you just because they happen to be regulated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.020</a></span> | <span class="t">You want two adults in the room or at least one adult in the room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.300</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have two children in the room, like grown children, adults, then everybody gets dysregulated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's really important that at least one person is being the adult in the room and one person is regulated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">If both people, like you're in an argument, both people are dysregulated, nothing good is going to come from that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">In which case is the best option to just pause it until somebody returns to adulthood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And that happens so often.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.540</a></span> | <span class="t">It's such an easy fix for couples because sometimes they think we have to deal with this right now and it feels urgent to deal with it right now because I feel hurt right now or I can't believe you said that or we need to, you know, resolve this right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">That can be the worst possible thing.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It's I'm going to go take a walk or I'm going to go to the gym or I'm going to go, you know, read for a few minutes or I'm going to go relax, whatever that is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And then let's talk in an hour about it or let's talk tonight.</span></div><div

making up stories about the other person?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.580</a></span> | <span

if you can say, if I were telling this story from the other person's perspective, what would their version of this story be?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

thing that I've observed, I don't have any formal data on this, is that some of the happiest couples I know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">are couples where I would refer to one person in the relationship as more emotive and expressive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.700</a></span> | <span class="t">and the other person as a little bit on the spectrum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And my observation is that part of the reason those couples seem so harmonious is that the little things don't seem to bother the person on the spectrum</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=778" target="_blank">00:12:58.900</a></span> | <span class="t">because they don't register them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't get entangled in the other person's downs or ups, which I guess could be problematic in theory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But it just seems like they get along really well because, and I won't, you know, kind of stereotype the labels,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but these couples that I know, it does happen to be the male who is a little bit on the spectrum</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and the woman who's a little more emotive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And it just seems like there's so much harmony there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I talk to him, I'm generally closer to the man in the relationship, although not always.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">They say like, yeah, like, you know, it doesn't bother me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">There's, I just like, we'll listen or if there's something to request, I'll respond to the request.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">There isn't this entanglement of she's upset, so I like have to respond or this is really painful to listen to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.060</a></span> | <span class="t">It's more of like a kind of matter of fact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just think it's an interesting dynamic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It's obviously not one that people can pre-program themselves for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But I do think it's an interesting dynamic as opposed to what you're describing where emotions can kind of ratchet together like gears.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And that can be wonderful when people are in, you know, ecstatic states or happy or there's like the banter of certain couples</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that seem pretty emotive is something I'm also familiar with observing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But those couples also seem like more volatile, like when somebody is upset, the other person gets upset.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And it just starts to deteriorate pretty quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't want two highly reactive people to be together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">You also, I think, need to think about there's a saying we marry our unfinished business, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's say that there's somebody who had a parent who was very kind of avoidant or withdrawn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.900</a></span> | <span class="t">That person, if they haven't processed that, will be drawn to the partner who is more avoidant, but not because it feels good, but because it's familiar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so sometimes in the kind of couple that you're describing, and I don't know the experience of your friends,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.020</a></span> | <span class="t">but I've seen a lot of couples where it looks like that would be a good match because one person is, you know, sort of more in the emotional sphere and one person is less so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But sometimes what that is is one person gets very lonely because they're not really getting that kind of emotional interaction that they want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So it can be a solution for some people because they don't know how to be with a different kind of person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But I also feel like you want to make sure that you have figured out your unfinished business,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">that you're not just – you don't just have radar for the kind of person who hurt you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So what often happens is people haven't processed whatever it was that they wanted more of or less of when they were growing up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they go out into the world and they're looking for a partner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And they literally have radar for a person who is exactly like the person who hurt them but doesn't look like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like I'm going to choose someone who is the opposite of the parent who hurt me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you find this person and after you get to know them a little bit, you're like, wow, that person drinks a lot too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't realize that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Or that person is really withholding too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't see that at first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Or that person yells a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't notice that at first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're like, how did I get into this exact situation that hurt me as a child?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's because your unconscious is saying, you look familiar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Come closer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Because what we're trying to do is we're trying to win.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We're trying to master a situation where we felt helpless as a child.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.340</a></span> | <span class="t">We couldn't control the situation with our parents when we were growing up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1005" target="_blank">00:16:45.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And now we think, again, this is completely outside of our awareness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to win this time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to master this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to get love from that kind of person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And it doesn't work out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that you really want to make sure that you are choosing someone for healthy reasons and not because there's some unfinished business that you're trying to work out with this person who is not going to meet your needs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">To go a little bit further into this idea, which, by the way, I fully subscribe to based on your explanation of this and my belief that our unconscious mind is driving a lot of our choices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">My understanding is that what you just described doesn't adhere to mom, dad, male, female compartmentalization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">What I mean by that is that I think a lot of people will hear what you just said and assume, okay, if my dad hurt me in the following ways, then let's say it's a woman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And she said, you know, my dad hurt me in the following ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe he was a drinker, withdrawn, or he was violent or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Then that woman will seek out men that mimic that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Here I'm assuming heterosexual relationship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But if her mother was the one that was the drinker, violent, and or withdrawn, and she's heterosexual, my understanding is based on the dynamics that you describe, if she will find those traits in a man.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Because she's heterosexual, she's seeking men for romantic partners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's very important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1098" target="_blank">00:18:18.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that sometimes we put the mom-dad labels on top of the attraction to, again, staying in the heterosexual framework here, the opposite sex framework.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1113" target="_blank">00:18:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And then people say, well, why is it that this woman always seeks out these, like, what ended up being really terrible guys?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, she had such a great dad, but she had a dreadful mom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.500</a></span> | <span class="t">That is absolutely correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1123" target="_blank">00:18:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it's so interesting because I think that people think that having one parent that gave you what you needed is protective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And in some ways it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1131" target="_blank">00:18:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But the thing that hurts is the thing that gets the most attention inside of our bodies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So we don't necessarily think it, but we felt it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1141" target="_blank">00:19:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">We internalized it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=1142"

biggest fear deep down in our unconscious is fear of death, we'll pretty much stay anywhere where we're continuing to be alive and not, like, in the moment of fearing death.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2341" target="_blank">00:39:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And I do think, ultimately, we're all just really afraid of death.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2344" target="_blank">00:39:04.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think we're afraid of death.</span></div><div

think we deny death.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2350" target="_blank">00:39:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">We're all sort of death deniers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2352" target="_blank">00:39:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, we know it's out there somewhere, but we don't know when or how it's going to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2356" target="_blank">00:39:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, we just pretend, because there's no real, no pun intended, but deadline, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2362" target="_blank">00:39:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, we just think, sort of, we know, intellectually, we don't have forever, but we kind of think we do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2368" target="_blank">00:39:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, when you think about, sort of, the stages of psychosocial development, you know, you start with, you know, these conflicts that you have to work through at every stage of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2378" target="_blank">00:39:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And sort of the one where you're sort of the last stage is integrity versus despair.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2383" target="_blank">00:39:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, integrity is if you have lived a life where you don't have a lot of regret, you feel like you lived the kind of life that you wanted, you accomplished the things that you wanted to accomplish for the most part, whether that's relationally, professionally, some combination there, you have a sense of integrity at the end of your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2402" target="_blank">00:40:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">If you didn't, you have this sense of despair.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2406" target="_blank">00:40:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">People who work through that and have integrity are not afraid of death.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2411" target="_blank">00:40:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The people who are in despair are very afraid of death because they have so many regrets and they can't go back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2418" target="_blank">00:40:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't get a redo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2419" target="_blank">00:40:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, I like to, in psychotherapy, really remind people that they need to keep death awareness sitting on one shoulder, not to be morbid, but to actually make you live more fully.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2432" target="_blank">00:40:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">If you are aware of death, if you really look death right in the eye, you have more intentionality when you wake up every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2440" target="_blank">00:40:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You say, I don't have forever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2441" target="_blank">00:40:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's not like sometime in the future I might die.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2445" target="_blank">00:40:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like you could die today, tomorrow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2447" target="_blank">00:40:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, anything could happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2450" target="_blank">00:40:50.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think, you know, when I say I write about this in my book where I was seeing this woman who was in her early 30s and she was diagnosed with cancer and everyone thought she was going to be fine and then there was a sort of rare recurrence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2463" target="_blank">00:41:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And when she was newly married and her whole life was, like, turned upside down and she really made me, as the therapist, look death in the eye in that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2474" target="_blank">00:41:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You know how, like, you want to say something like, you know, she was talking about the things that people would say to her because we all have this death denial.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2482" target="_blank">00:41:22.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And they would say, did you get a second opinion?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2484" target="_blank">00:41:24.740</a></span> | <span class="t">As if, no, she's not going to get a second opinion about whether she's going to die, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2488" target="_blank">00:41:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, they'll say things like, well, these experimental treatments might work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2492" target="_blank">00:41:32.320</a></span> |

after that conversation to adopt a practice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2672" target="_blank">00:44:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I do this yoga nidra, non-sleep, deep rest thing every day for about 10 to 30 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2678" target="_blank">00:44:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's this moment right at the beginning where you're supposed to take a deep breath and then a long exhale to relax your body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2684" target="_blank">00:44:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you go into listening to the script.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2686" target="_blank">00:44:46.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And ever since that

class="t">And as I do it, I remind myself, this is, if I'm awake or if it's not an accident that happens very fast, this is probably what it's going to feel like to, like, die.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2703" target="_blank">00:45:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so just trying to, like, I'm – so I like this idea of readying myself for death every day as a means to access what you're talking about, which is trying to live better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2713" target="_blank">00:45:13.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2714" target="_blank">00:45:14.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, not to be morbid, just try to, like, yes, I'm, like, a biological vessel at some point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2718" target="_blank">00:45:18.840</a></span> | <span class="t">My body, my brain, or both will just give out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2721" target="_blank">00:45:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Or I'll get – bullet buster cancer is kind of what I always say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2724" target="_blank">00:45:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Something will take me out, and there'll be this final – and that's it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2729" target="_blank">00:45:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And the closer that I feel like that we can get to that understanding and be like, okay, super scary, and I'm not there now.</span></div><div

I can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2741" target="_blank">00:45:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And it doesn't have to be scary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2743" target="_blank">00:45:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It sounds like you're aiming toward an acceptance of death, which is, I think, the way that we get motivated to live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2752" target="_blank">00:45:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not fear of death.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2753" target="_blank">00:45:53.940</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not what I'm suggesting at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2755" target="_blank">00:45:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think we should be afraid of death.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2757" target="_blank">00:45:57.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we should say we get this precious time however long we get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2761" target="_blank">00:46:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Everybody gets their own amount of time on – you know, in this life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2765" target="_blank">00:46:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's an acceptance of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2767" target="_blank">00:46:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not a fear of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2768" target="_blank">00:46:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think about how when people are afraid of death, they do things that are counterproductive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2773" target="_blank">00:46:13.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Like a lot of affairs happen in the wake of a death.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2777" target="_blank">00:46:17.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So a parent dies, and somebody then feels like, oh, I don't have a lot of time left.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2783" target="_blank">00:46:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Am I really happy in this relationship?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2785" target="_blank">00:46:25.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Am I really alive?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2786" target="_blank">00:46:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Am I really living?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2787" target="_blank">00:46:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they go and do something like have an affair because they want that sense of vitality because they're doing it out of fear, not out of, oh, I accept that death is a part of our existence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2800" target="_blank">00:46:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And if I'm not feeling alive, is it because of my relationship or my marriage or is it because I am not actively doing things in my life to create that sense of vitality?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2812" target="_blank">00:46:52.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So very often in the wake of some kind of brush with death, like some kind of closeness, like maybe you had a brush with death or maybe a parent died or someone close to you died or a friend or a sibling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2826" target="_blank">00:47:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So often people act out and they do these things to create the sense of I'm alive as opposed to saying, wait, what do I need to look at in my life that will make me feel more alive that is not self-sabotaging?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2842" target="_blank">00:47:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2845" target="_blank">00:47:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptogens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2850" target="_blank">00:47:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I started taking AG1 way back in 2012, long before I even knew what a podcast was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2855" target="_blank">00:47:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I started taking it and I still take it every single day because it ensures that I meet my quota for daily vitamins and minerals and it helps make sure that I get enough prebiotics and probiotics to support my gut health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2866" target="_blank">00:47:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Over the past 10 years, gut health has emerged as something that we realize is important not only for the health of our digestion, but also for our immune system and for the production of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, things like dopamine and serotonin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2879" target="_blank">00:47:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, gut health is critical for proper brain function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2883" target="_blank">00:48:03.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, of course, I strive to eat healthy whole foods from unprocessed sources for the majority of my nutritional intake, but there are a number of things in AG1, including specific micronutrients that are hard or impossible to get from whole foods.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2894" target="_blank">00:48:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So by taking AG1 daily, I get the vitamins and minerals that I need, along with the probiotics and prebiotics for gut health, and in turn, brain and immune system health, and the adaptogens and critical micronutrients that are essential for all organs and tissues of the body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2909" target="_blank">00:48:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So anytime somebody asks me if they were to only take one supplement, what that supplement should be, I always say AG1 because AG1 supports so many different systems in the brain and body that relate to our mental health, physical health, and performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2921"

28 grams of protein, only 150 calories, and zero grams of sugar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2966" target="_blank">00:49:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right, 28 grams of protein, and 75% of its calories come from protein.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2971" target="_blank">00:49:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">This is 50% higher than the next closest protein bar.</span></div><div

chocolate chip cookie dough, but then again, I also like the new chocolate peanut butter flavor and the chocolate brownie flavor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2985" target="_blank">00:49:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, I like all the flavors a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span

days and how many times per day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=2993" target="_blank">00:49:53.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I

| <span class="t">With David, I'm able to get 28 grams of protein in the calories of a snack, which makes it easy to hit my protein goals of one gram of protein per pound of body weight per day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3005" target="_blank">00:50:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and it allows me to do so without ingesting too many calories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3009" target="_blank">00:50:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll eat a David protein bar most afternoons as a snack, and I always keep one with me when I'm out of the house or traveling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3015" target="_blank">00:50:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're incredibly delicious, and given that they have 28 grams of protein, they're really satisfying for having just 150 calories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3022" target="_blank">00:50:22.260</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:50:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And he said, you know, you have to do things that energize you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3059" target="_blank">00:50:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And immediately I thought, yes, and be very careful about the things that activate us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3065" target="_blank">00:51:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Like there's this difference

target="_blank">00:51:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's a little bit semantic, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3072" target="_blank">00:51:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But I feel like something that energizes me is like I love

one of those guys or gals solving a puzzle, like just energizes me in a way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3093" target="_blank">00:51:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel it in my body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3094" target="_blank">00:51:34.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It's energy that I can use for other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

we – it's like a stress response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3107" target="_blank">00:51:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's arousal, but it's negative valence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3109" target="_blank">00:51:49.640</a></span> | <span

draining.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3110" target="_blank">00:51:50.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like pulling and it's taking from these things that energize us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3114" target="_blank">00:51:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And I feel like it's – being able to notice those subtleties is hard in real time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3119" target="_blank">00:51:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And – but I feel like vitality is about the things that energize us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3125" target="_blank">00:52:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when you talk about that draining kind of activation, sometimes what we do when that happens is we go numb.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3131" target="_blank">00:52:11.920</a></span> | <span

feel anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3134" target="_blank">00:52:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, there's this great expression that the – like scrolling through the internet when people mindlessly do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3139" target="_blank">00:52:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It's – a colleague of mine said it's the most effective non-prescription painkiller out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3143" target="_blank">00:52:23.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you repeat that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3144" target="_blank">00:52:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I want people to understand this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3146" target="_blank">00:52:26.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3146" target="_blank">00:52:26.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's the most effective non-prescription painkiller out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3150" target="_blank">00:52:30.620</a></span> | <span

interesting when you think about numbness because people think that numbness is the absence of feelings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3158" target="_blank">00:52:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But actually numbness is the sense of being overwhelmed by too many feelings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3163" target="_blank">00:52:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you're shutting down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3165" target="_blank">00:52:45.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So when people say, oh, I'm numb.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3167" target="_blank">00:52:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not feeling anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3169" target="_blank">00:52:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, you're feeling so much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3172" target="_blank">00:52:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're feeling flooded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3173" target="_blank">00:52:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You're feeling

out what are you feeling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3178" target="_blank">00:52:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's actually a state of arousal that you can't handle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3184" target="_blank">00:53:04.260</a></span> |

listen to that 100 times because, you know, we've heard so much about dopamine hits that I think people have lost sight of the fact that when you're online and you're just awash in all this

thing of brachycardia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3267" target="_blank">00:54:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know,

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3295" target="_blank">00:54:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when you really get into it, it's like this person's feeling all kinds of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3299" target="_blank">00:54:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's really important that we understand, you know, when we are shut down versus when we are calm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3307" target="_blank">00:55:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are two very different states.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3309" target="_blank">00:55:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Could you go into that a little bit further?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3312" target="_blank">00:55:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3312" target="_blank">00:55:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, here's an example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3313" target="_blank">00:55:13.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So a couple comes in, let's say it's a heterosexual couple, but it could be any couple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3317" target="_blank">00:55:17.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Often it is the woman in the couple who will say something to her partner like, I just feel like I can't reach you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3326" target="_blank">00:55:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like we're very disconnected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3327" target="_blank">00:55:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I want you to tell me how you feel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3330" target="_blank">00:55:30.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And because of our cultural stigma around men showing emotion, he has told himself like, yeah, this bothers me or that bothers me or I'm unhappy in this way, but I don't feel anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3342" target="_blank">00:55:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3342" target="_blank">00:55:42.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Our marriage is good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3344" target="_blank">00:55:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he doesn't even understand why he's there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3346" target="_blank">00:55:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And he thinks he's there for her because she insisted on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3351" target="_blank">00:55:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when we finally get to maybe something that he's feeling and he finally does open up, it's so interesting because maybe he's sharing something very vulnerable or maybe he tears up a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3362" target="_blank">00:56:02.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can tell, like your body will tell you what you're feeling even if you aren't aware of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3367" target="_blank">00:56:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You see, okay, there's some moisture there in his eyes or maybe a tear falls or maybe he actually starts crying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3372" target="_blank">00:56:12.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And her reaction and her whole reason for bringing him in was, you know, I need you to open up to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3379" target="_blank">00:56:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to feel connected to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3380" target="_blank">00:56:20.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to understand your inner life more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3382" target="_blank">00:56:22.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, he does it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3383" target="_blank">00:56:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And she then looks at me like a deer in headlights, like, oh, wow, I don't feel safe when he doesn't open up to me, but I also don't feel safe when he's being vulnerable in this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3396" target="_blank">00:56:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And these are sort of gender stereotypes that we think we might not fall prey to, but we do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3403" target="_blank">00:56:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's so interesting that often men are the ones who seem sort of numb or calm, right, which are two, again, very different things in the relationship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3411" target="_blank">00:56:51.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's not really the case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3414" target="_blank">00:56:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It's that there's no room for him to express anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3418" target="_blank">00:56:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So he has to kind of push everything down, probably, again, outside of his awareness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3423" target="_blank">00:57:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the couple feels disconnected and both of them are unhappy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3427" target="_blank">00:57:07.700</a></span> | <span class="t">This idea that more words means more emotional, I don't buy it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3434" target="_blank">00:57:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3435" target="_blank">00:57:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it's interesting because men will come in if I'm seeing them alone and they'll often say something like, I've never told anyone this before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3445" target="_blank">00:57:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And they literally mean, I've never told anyone this before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3448" target="_blank">00:57:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Because when men hang out, they're not, it's not the same sort of level of let's talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3456" target="_blank">00:57:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Women will come in and say something like, I've never told anyone this before except for my mother, my sister, my best friend, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3465" target="_blank">00:57:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So they've told maybe one, two or three people, but they feel like they haven't told anyone because for women, that's kind of not telling anyone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3473" target="_blank">00:57:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Now you have people concerned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3474" target="_blank">00:57:54.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So if somebody, if a woman says to me, I didn't tell anyone, that means she only told four people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3480" target="_blank">00:58:00.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't mean secrets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3480" target="_blank">00:58:00.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't mean secrets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3482" target="_blank">00:58:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean like something about themselves where they feel maybe hesitant to share that or they feel ashamed about that or they're not sure about something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3490" target="_blank">00:58:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see that difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3493" target="_blank">00:58:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But I also think it happens very early.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3496" target="_blank">00:58:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm the mom of a boy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3498" target="_blank">00:58:18.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, he's now a teenager.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3499" target="_blank">00:58:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's interesting because when I didn't notice this till I was raising a boy, and I grew up with a brother, but I didn't notice it, that when he, let's say, he would like fall on the playground, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3512" target="_blank">00:58:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And like at like two or three years old, everybody would say to him or the boys around him like, oh, it's fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3520" target="_blank">00:58:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Brush it off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3520" target="_blank">00:58:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">You're good.</span></div><div

that age, they're like, oh, honey, come here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3528" target="_blank">00:58:48.180</a></span> | <span

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3531" target="_blank">00:58:51.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So very early on, they get these messages like girls can talk about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3536" target="_blank">00:58:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Boys can't talk about

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3555" target="_blank">00:59:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, his arm is like kind of hanging off, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span

ER.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3561" target="_blank">00:59:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And, of course, he was mortified that I said that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3564" target="_blank">00:59:24.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But, in fact, he had broken his arm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3566" target="_blank">00:59:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3568" target="_blank">00:59:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">If a girl had fallen down

target="_blank">00:59:33.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So what happens when these people get into adult relationships and this was what they were told about words and talking about things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=3583" target="_blank">00:59:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You really see those

want to say about words is women are brought up to think that whenever you have a feeling, you should share it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6219" target="_blank">01:43:39.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Or even someone who, you know, it's like, well, and this is the reason that people don't actually get help for things because they think, well, you know, it's just this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6228"

target="_blank">01:43:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Or I'm feeling kind of sad or I can't sleep or I'm having trouble in this relationship, but it's not that bad because I have a roof over my head and food on the table, so I don't need to go get help.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6240" target="_blank">01:44:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But let's say you fall and you clearly have, like, you know, broken your wrist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6245" target="_blank">01:44:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">You're not going to sit there and go, I don't need to do anything about that because

target="_blank">01:44:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So we treat sort of physical health and mental health as two separate entities when, of course, the mind and the body are all intertwined.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6264" target="_blank">01:44:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that with breakups, it's the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6266" target="_blank">01:44:26.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like people think, well, it's not that big of a deal after the first X amount of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6273" target="_blank">01:44:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And breakups can really mark you depending on how they went down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6277" target="_blank">01:44:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, if it was really volatile, if it was one of these things where you got no sense of if you were cheated on, if you didn't understand why the breakup happened, like, it was very surprising to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6295" target="_blank">01:44:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, all those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6296" target="_blank">01:44:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">It can really be a different kind of breakup than a breakup where a person, it might be very painful, but you understand sort of why the breakup is happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6305" target="_blank">01:45:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't mean you don't feel the loss.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6308" target="_blank">01:45:08.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's something different about the quality of the breakup.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6311" target="_blank">01:45:11.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so then people tell stories about the breakup because they didn't get the real story.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6316" target="_blank">01:45:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So the story now becomes, like, you don't really understand why the person is breaking up with you because they didn't communicate during the relationship that maybe they were unhappy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6324" target="_blank">01:45:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And now you watch them on

target="_blank">01:46:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">In my observation and experience, one of the hardest things about breakups is this idea that we want to somehow come to a common narrative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6419" target="_blank">01:46:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And there seems to be a lot of desire to kind of understand where the other person's experience of what happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6428" target="_blank">01:47:08.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And a very – I don't think it's intentional, but I think people can be somewhat destructive in a breakup by changing the whole – this notion like it was all an illusion or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6442" target="_blank">01:47:22.700</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6450" target="_blank">01:47:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">There's things that you thought were love that weren't.</span></div><div

all sorts of shapes and forms of this stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6458" target="_blank">01:47:38.600</a></span> | <span

although I've gotten, quote, unquote, better at it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6494" target="_blank">01:48:14.020</a></span> |

breakup that didn't really hurt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6499" target="_blank">01:48:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't matter if I left or they left.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6502" target="_blank">01:48:22.500</a></span> | <span

class="t">And I think it's this idea of, like – and this is why I think it's an interesting, perhaps, segue to grief is that it's almost like as something ends, we look back and we evaluate the story and try and figure out was that real?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6518" target="_blank">01:48:38.420</a></span> | <span

real?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6521" target="_blank">01:48:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we're here, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6523" target="_blank">01:48:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There was all this hope and

this a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6528" target="_blank">01:48:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

about the other person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6534" target="_blank">01:48:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's about the loss of what it feels like to be in a primary relationship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6537" target="_blank">01:48:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you're losing the primary relationship and then it happens to be with this specific person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6544" target="_blank">01:49:04.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, there were good qualities about that specific person and qualities that maybe weren't right for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6551" target="_blank">01:49:11.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But, what you're losing is the dailiness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6554" target="_blank">01:49:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, so much of what feels good about being in a primary relationship is, you know, you get to tell the person the minutiae of your day, the little things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6563" target="_blank">01:49:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">The shared history and the shared experiences that become the shorthand and the inside jokes and the routine of, you know, your flight landed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6572"

target="_blank">01:49:34.980</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, just the built-in infrastructure of being in a primary relationship and someone who knows, like, what kind of pizza you like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6582" target="_blank">01:49:42.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, all those little things that come from, you know, going through daily life together and, you know, all the things about their families and, you know, all the things about the people in their lives and the people they're talking about, like this friend and this boss and whatever, their coworkers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6599"

of your life changes drastically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6611" target="_blank">01:50:11.680</a></span> | <span

out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6624" target="_blank">01:50:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But you don't know now because,

target="_blank">01:50:34.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, your world changes so much in the day-to-day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">01:50:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You might replace it with things in your own life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6835" target="_blank">01:53:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, like, it smells different here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6838" target="_blank">01:53:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's this theory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6840" target="_blank">01:54:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It's from the Gottmans who do this research on couples.</span></div><div

five deposits into the bank of goodwill for every one withdrawal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6852" target="_blank">01:54:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we tend to, when we're in a relationship and we don't like something about something that's happening in the relationship, we think about what's not working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6860" target="_blank">01:54:20.460</a></span> | <span class="t">We're taking all these withdrawals from the bank of goodwill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6864" target="_blank">01:54:24.120</a></span> | <span

smell so good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6868" target="_blank">01:54:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I really like your

enough?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6870" target="_blank">01:54:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Do we focus on the things, like, how many deposits are we actually making so that when we do make a withdrawal, it doesn't empty the bank account?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6879" target="_blank">01:54:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's usually when a breakup happens that all of a sudden we think about all those things that we didn't deposit but now we miss, right, that we're sitting in our bank account and we don't have access to that account anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6892" target="_blank">01:54:52.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The account's closed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6893" target="_blank">01:54:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But when the account was open, we didn't look at what we had in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=6899" target="_blank">01:54:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that the people who are – what I see with couples who are most successful are the people who do notice what's in the bank account even if they have to take a withdrawal every now and again.</span></div><div

often start a couple session with, how did you meet?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7040" target="_blank">01:57:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Because usually when people come to couples therapy, they think the first thing that's going to happen is you're going to say, so what's going on?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7047" target="_blank">01:57:27.700</a></span> | <span class="t">What's not, you know, what's, then they'll start with the problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7051" target="_blank">01:57:31.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they're like in that withdrawal from the bank account space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7055" target="_blank">01:57:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So I like to say, well, tell me how you met.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7057" target="_blank">01:57:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And immediately, usually, there's like, oh, and they have this great story, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7062" target="_blank">01:57:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And they remember what they love about the other person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7065" target="_blank">01:57:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So we start with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7067" target="_blank">01:57:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see them sort of remembering who the person is that they fell in love with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7072" target="_blank">01:57:52.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, oh, I thought he was so cute or, you know, oh, was this really, we were friends for a year and I didn't know if he liked me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7079" target="_blank">01:57:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then this happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7080" target="_blank">01:58:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I really admired this about him or her, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7084" target="_blank">01:58:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they start in this different space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7086" target="_blank">01:58:06.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think about it like, and this is going to sound like a weird metaphor, but you think about, like, nonstick pans versus, like, you know, a regular pan that you have to put something in so that the stuff doesn't stick to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7097" target="_blank">01:58:17.460</a></span> | <span class="t">When I think about, like, there are people for whom the good stuff, they're like Teflon pans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7102" target="_blank">01:58:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The good stuff doesn't stick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7104" target="_blank">01:58:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But the bad stuff about the other person sticks like a nonstick, like a pan that sticks, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7111" target="_blank">01:58:31.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like you think about, like, what is sticking about your partner when you think about, like, what they're putting in the pan, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7118" target="_blank">01:58:38.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, are you in a Teflon pan for good things or are you in, you know, a different kind of pan for good things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7124" target="_blank">01:58:44.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you have to think, like, what am I focusing on?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7127" target="_blank">01:58:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Where does my attention go?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7129" target="_blank">01:58:49.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, why are you focusing on the things that are upsetting you so much?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7134" target="_blank">01:58:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, there are certain things that you're never going to change about your partner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7138" target="_blank">01:58:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, your partner – we don't get to order up our partners a la carte.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7141" target="_blank">01:59:01.860</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't get to say, like, I'll take these qualities of my partner, but I'll take this thing that I don't like about them on the side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7147" target="_blank">01:59:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't get to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7149" target="_blank">01:59:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">People come.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7150" target="_blank">01:59:10.220</a></span> | <span class="t">There are no substitutions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7151" target="_blank">01:59:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">They come as a whole.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7152" target="_blank">01:59:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">That's it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7153" target="_blank">01:59:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what's offered on the menu.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7154" target="_blank">01:59:14.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And so people think, well, I can change the thing that I don't like and I can, like, make that person a la carte.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7160" target="_blank">01:59:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7161" target="_blank">01:59:21.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't order them up that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7162" target="_blank">01:59:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are always going to be things that irritate you or that are suboptimal in a perfect world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7168" target="_blank">01:59:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">About your partner, are you going to focus on that or are you going to focus on the things that you really love about your partner?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7176" target="_blank">01:59:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a saying from 12-step, which is identify, don't compare, which is, like, because you'll hear people outside of 12-step talking about, for instance, you know, like, you know, well, he's this, this, and this, and ambitious, and this, and that, but he's, like, kind of emotionally unavailable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7196" target="_blank">01:59:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But he's more available.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7198" target="_blank">01:59:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And people will talk about male or female partners, right, or potential partners, like, or people that they're dating, as if you could kludge together the best of all people and get this, like, perfect tapestry of the person that's got all the features you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7211" target="_blank">02:00:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, yeah, some people are a little more easygoing, lighthearted, and sometimes, not always, less ambitious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7218" target="_blank">02:00:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Those things, in my experience, tend to correlate, not always.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7222" target="_blank">02:00:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people are super hard driving, they get it done, and they have the capacity to be immense providers, but they have less time, and sometimes they're not as emotionally available.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7232" target="_blank">02:00:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, stereotyping like crazy here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7233" target="_blank">02:00:33.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But people get this idea that they're sort of, like, through the comparison, they can arrive at the perfect person, when, in fact, I think appreciation, not being Teflon about the positive stuff, comes from kind of shutting out the idea that there's an alternative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7249" target="_blank">02:00:49.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But, of course, you don't want to end up in a situation where the person is, you know, not, truly not good for you, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7256" target="_blank">02:00:56.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7257" target="_blank">02:00:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not what I'm talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7258" target="_blank">02:00:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7258" target="_blank">02:00:58.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't think you are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7259" target="_blank">02:00:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But, yeah, with that caveat, I think that accepting that people are complicated and there is an occlusion together of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7266" target="_blank">02:01:06.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7266" target="_blank">02:01:06.500</a></span> | <span class="t">At some point, you make a choice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7267" target="_blank">02:01:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is when people cheat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7269" target="_blank">02:01:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">What often happens is there's a specific quality about their partner, maybe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7275" target="_blank">02:01:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes it has nothing to do with your partner, by the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7278" target="_blank">02:01:18.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think this is so important to talk about when we talk about infidelity, that often it really has nothing to do with the partner, that somebody is expecting their partner, again, going back to vitality and aliveness, to provide that for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7291" target="_blank">02:01:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And if the partner doesn't provide that for them, but your partner shouldn't be providing that for you, they're additive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7296" target="_blank">02:01:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">They're not providing a lack or a deficit in you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7299" target="_blank">02:01:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">That sometimes that's why people cheat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7302" target="_blank">02:01:42.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But other times they say, like, there's this quality about my partner that is really, you know, like, I don't like it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7309" target="_blank">02:01:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, let's take, for example, I wish that my partner were more, let's say, ambitious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7315" target="_blank">02:01:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So they go and they, like, cheat with someone who's more ambitious, but then the person isn't loving or isn't communicative or isn't, you know, whatever the other good qualities that the partner they have has.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7326" target="_blank">02:02:06.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So they think that by replacing this one trait that the other person is going to have all the other great traits that the existing partner already has.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7335" target="_blank">02:02:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And generally you're treating, like, one set of problems for another set of problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7339" target="_blank">02:02:19.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's interesting that people think, like, I can fix this problem because this person has that thing that I really want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7346" target="_blank">02:02:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if your partner doesn't have any of that, like, it's a degree, it's on a spectrum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7351" target="_blank">02:02:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So is your partner not ambitious at all?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7353" target="_blank">02:02:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Or is your partner ambitious about different kinds of things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7356" target="_blank">02:02:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, they want to be a really good parent and they're really, you know, invested in that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7361" target="_blank">02:02:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Or they want to do something, like, philanthropic and they're really invested in that, but it doesn't pay a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7366" target="_blank">02:02:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, so, like, what are they, like, what energizes them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7370" target="_blank">02:02:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Where is their purpose?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7371" target="_blank">02:02:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Where is their meaning?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7372" target="_blank">02:02:52.100</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there's different kinds of ambition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7374" target="_blank">02:02:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like placing one's attention on the good things as much as possible and really letting those fill us up as much as possible is really key.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7387" target="_blank">02:03:07.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't say this, but I borrowed this, but, you know, that two of the most dangerous words in the English language are if only.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7395" target="_blank">02:03:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, this idea, like, if only this, you know, because for two reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7399" target="_blank">02:03:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">One is it's very unlikely that if only comes true, but the other one is it takes our attention away from seeing what's there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7407" target="_blank">02:03:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7408" target="_blank">02:03:28.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I like to say it's the difference between the what if and the what is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7411" target="_blank">02:03:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And people who focus too much on the what if, what if this, they lose sight of what is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7417" target="_blank">02:03:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And usually there's so much good that they really don't want to give up in the what is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7430" target="_blank">02:03:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the what if is a big trap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7431" target="_blank">02:03:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think this notion of attention and appreciation just seems so fundamental.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7439" target="_blank">02:03:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it's kind of like, think of it, so I am sort of an amateur photographer, and I think about it like you can take a picture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7447" target="_blank">02:04:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You can, like, focus on the same subject.</span></div><div class="c"><span

slightly, and then you're focused on something entirely different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7457"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7459" target="_blank">02:04:19.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I always say to people, like, can you – your focus is always on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7463" target="_blank">02:04:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you, like, move the camera

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7474" target="_blank">02:04:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, why don't you just move the camera and focus on the other things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7477" target="_blank">02:04:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You get to

well, my brain just goes there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7482" target="_blank">02:04:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">My

you get to choose what you put your attention on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7488" target="_blank">02:04:48.180</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7496" target="_blank">02:04:56.440</a></span> | <span class="t">We default to people that aren't healthy for us sometimes, not always.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7500" target="_blank">02:05:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet you also emphasize that we have a lot of agency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7505" target="_blank">02:05:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">These

target="_blank">02:05:11.300</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, for all that's been said about meditation and reflection and journaling on this podcast and others, like, we all know these tools are available.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7519" target="_blank">02:05:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They basically just take time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7521" target="_blank">02:05:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, with meditation, you don't even need a pen and paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7524" target="_blank">02:05:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we tend to look outward for answers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7529" target="_blank">02:05:29.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you ever give homework to your patients to just, like, think or journal?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7536" target="_blank">02:05:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Or is their work tend to be more behavioral?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7538" target="_blank">02:05:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it's kind of like I feel like the work that we do in the room is about understanding and, you know, and understanding sort of, like, where the gap is between what we say we want and what we actually do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7554" target="_blank">02:05:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, usually there is – it's all about what is in that gap, what is getting in the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7560" target="_blank">02:06:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Because we're very clear, by the way, about what we want usually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7563" target="_blank">02:06:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's, like, some gap between our behavior that isn't moving in that direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7568" target="_blank">02:06:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, moves us often – either keeps us stuck or moves us in the opposite direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7573" target="_blank">02:06:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's kind of out in the world between sessions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7576" target="_blank">02:06:16.260</a></span> | <span class="t">We're working on the behavior around what is getting in the way in that gap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7582" target="_blank">02:06:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we're doing kind of the thinking and the feeling in the session.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7585" target="_blank">02:06:25.640</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">02:06:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It means they're using their feelings and their thoughts differently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7591" target="_blank">02:06:31.940</a></span> | <span class="t">They're taking different actions with the feelings and thoughts outside of the session.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7596" target="_blank">02:06:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you ever tell people whenever you think that, just do the opposite?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7602" target="_blank">02:06:42.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's really funny because so many people say, like, your gut knows, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7606" target="_blank">02:06:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, listen to your gut.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7607"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7611" target="_blank">02:06:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what's in their gut?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7612" target="_blank">02:06:52.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, no, no, no.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7614" target="_blank">02:06:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't listen to your gut.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7615" target="_blank">02:06:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And it sounds really strange for a therapist to say to somebody, no, don't listen to your gut.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7619" target="_blank">02:06:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But sometimes you literally have to say to people, whatever your first instinct is there, do the opposite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7624" target="_blank">02:07:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Do the thing that feels uncomfortable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7626" target="_blank">02:07:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Because your gut is what feels comfortable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7627" target="_blank">02:07:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And the thing that feels comfortable, again, is the familiar.</span></div><div

going to lead you to where you want to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7636" target="_blank">02:07:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's not like I want people to second guess themselves or not trust themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7639" target="_blank">02:07:19.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It's that sometimes you have to learn how to hear that very, very quiet voice inside you because your gut is the louder one, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7647" target="_blank">02:07:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Your gut is your first

road, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7682" target="_blank">02:08:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">That now, so your first

keep going down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7695" target="_blank">02:08:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we're going

going to shut down that freeway eventually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7700" target="_blank">02:08:20.980</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">02:08:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So right now you've got to do the opposite to build this new freeway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

that is not the best path for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7716" target="_blank">02:08:36.780</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7834" target="_blank">02:10:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I learned to take progressively more and more risk and, you know, ended up having a air failure scuba diving, KJX diving with great white sharks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7847"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7852" target="_blank">02:10:52.820</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, so I think learning to overcome the adrenaline response and be calm and adrenaline, I think, has its value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7858" target="_blank">02:10:58.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7866" target="_blank">02:11:06.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can imagine that some people are so averse to danger that they don't put themselves into circumstances in which they could really come to thrive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7877" target="_blank">02:11:17.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And some people are just wired to go into the fire to the fire, either with physical pursuits or in romantic relationships.</span></div><div

friend who, you know, was in like an incredibly physically abusive relationship, number 12.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7901" target="_blank">02:11:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And she eventually came to the conclusion that her threat sensing threshold was just way too high.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7909" target="_blank">02:11:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Did some really good work to understand why that was and realized that her fear response didn't kick in until it was like a nine alarm fire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7917" target="_blank">02:11:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7917" target="_blank">02:11:57.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, she needed to listen to that, as you mentioned, that like super quiet whisper early on because anyone else who didn't have her history, which is sadly a very, very challenging history in her family, would have immediately been like, yeah, I'm out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7937" target="_blank">02:12:17.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But she was like, this is normal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7939" target="_blank">02:12:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7940" target="_blank">02:12:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I was in medical school, I remember the people who wanted to work in the ER were like, like I want to do emergency medicine, were people often who grew up in environments where danger was a part of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7955" target="_blank">02:12:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7955" target="_blank">02:12:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're used to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7956" target="_blank">02:12:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And it doesn't really strike them as like their sense of danger, their barometer is different from maybe a different person's.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7965" target="_blank">02:12:45.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I think of it as like a thermostat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7968" target="_blank">02:12:48.300</a></span> | <span class="t">When you think about like, let's say you want to set your thermostat at like 72 degrees, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7973" target="_blank">02:12:53.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people, their thermostat is off because in their house, like they did the slightest thing and their parents treated it like it was a huge, horrible mistake and they're bad and it was an emergency, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7985" target="_blank">02:13:05.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So they don't know how to calibrate like what does 72 actually feel like or the opposite, like some big thing happened and their parents underreacted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=7995" target="_blank">02:13:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they don't really know kind of like what is, what does 72 feel like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8000" target="_blank">02:13:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't really know what that like good temperature is like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8004" target="_blank">02:13:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that there's a lot of people who stay in situations that are like, it's like other people would say, whoa, it's like 100 degrees in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8013" target="_blank">02:13:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Get out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8013" target="_blank">02:13:33.900</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a fire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8014" target="_blank">02:13:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8015" target="_blank">02:13:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And this person's like, no, it's just feels like 72.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8018" target="_blank">02:13:38.060</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8019" target="_blank">02:13:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's really about recalibrating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8023" target="_blank">02:13:43.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think when we talk about risk and danger, you have to learn how to calibrate your own thermostat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8030" target="_blank">02:13:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that that's really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8033" target="_blank">02:13:53.860</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">02:13:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So unproductive anxiety is there's some kind of danger and I'm going to ruminate and ruminate and ruminate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8045" target="_blank">02:14:05.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm thinking about it all the time.</span></div><div

thinking about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8049" target="_blank">02:14:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's productive anxiety, which is, oh, it's good that I sense the danger because I'm going to do something about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8057" target="_blank">02:14:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I have a plan for how to deal with this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8060" target="_blank">02:14:20.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So it might be I'm in this relationship and it just doesn't feel right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8065" target="_blank">02:14:25.460</a></span> | <span class="t">But and this person is is acting this way toward me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8068" target="_blank">02:14:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And I know I shouldn't be treated this way, but I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8070" target="_blank">02:14:30.520</a></span> |

that's not productive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8072" target="_blank">02:14:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That's just anxiety.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8073" target="_blank">02:14:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You're just circling, ruminating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8075" target="_blank">02:14:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Productive anxiety would be like something's wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8078" target="_blank">02:14:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I shouldn't be treated this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8080" target="_blank">02:14:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So my plan is I'm going to try to talk to my partner about this or we're going to go to therapy about this and see if it improves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8085" target="_blank">02:14:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it doesn't, I'm going to leave to find a different

say, like, trust your gut, somebody might say, well, my gut is that, like, when things are really unpleasant, you stick with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8105" target="_blank">02:15:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because my parents stuck with my other parent when things were really

do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=8109" target="_blank">02:15:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div

that when we make that list that you said, like, do you – should you take things off the list?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=9529" target="_blank">02:38:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that you need to have flexibility about things that may not matter, but you have to be very inflexible about the things that do matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=9539" target="_blank">02:38:59.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So character qualities, they matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=9542" target="_blank">02:39:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Values that align, that matters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=9546" target="_blank">02:39:06.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So those are things that don't be flexible on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=9549" target="_blank">02:39:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just want to make sure I understand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=9550" target="_blank">02:39:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're talking about two different lists here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=9552" target="_blank">02:39:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">One is a list of features about the other person is what we hear as, like, the list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=9557" target="_blank">02:39:17.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The number of times that friends are like, you have to make a list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=9561" target="_blank">02:39:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I never get around to making a list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=9562" target="_blank">02:39:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But I like this other list that you described, which is all the things about ourselves that would make us difficult to be with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=9568" target="_blank">02:39:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Which list or both do we need to have rigidity versus flexibility on?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=9573" target="_blank">02:39:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm saying that when we think of that list – and by the way, a lot of people don't sit there and write a list, but they have it in their head.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=9580" target="_blank">02:39:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there's this process

class="t">Some people say, like, I know it when I see it, but there's really a list in there because you know what you're looking for and it matches this list in your head.</span></div><div

like character qualities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=9594" target="_blank">02:39:54.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Are they honest?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=9595" target="_blank">02:39:55.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Are they

them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=9599" target="_blank">02:39:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Do we have the same kind of

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=9632" target="_blank">02:40:32.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that question that I'm going back to of how does this person make me feel if

think no matter what people come to therapy for, no matter what we call the presenting problem, you know, they're coming because whatever they want to say it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span

the core of it and we have to solve that problem so that the problem they came in for, you know, it's kind of like you're dealing with content, which is like here's the problem, and process, which is what's going on underneath.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=10236" target="_blank">02:50:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And if we can solve the process, then you solve content in multiple areas of your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=10243" target="_blank">02:50:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not just this one problem that you came in with, but generally if you learn at the core what the issue is that gets in the kind of love or be loved area, you learn how to navigate through the world differently in your professional life, in your romantic life, in your platonic friendship life, in your family life.</span></div><div

that one discrete problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=10266" target="_blank">02:51:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes it is, but many times it's about if we can get to the deeper process issue, then you will solve so many different problems simultaneously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=11810" target="_blank">03:16:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's

to stay stuck in what is unpleasant but hasn't killed them yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=11836"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYK4UFf8mlc&t=11881" target="_blank">03:18:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So you might have to switch up the order, and that's okay.</span></div><div
