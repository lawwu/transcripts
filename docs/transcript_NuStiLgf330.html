Like the champagne showers is so sick. - We was in the locker room. Yeah, people don't know. We were in the locker room for hours on hours. Like after we won the tip, you know, the celebrations on the court, then you move it to the locker room and we were in there just going crazy for hours.</p><p>It was like a club in there. - It was, bro. It was like a club in the locker room. It was just drenched, like soaked in champagne. Like the alcohol, it was like low-key burning my nostrils. Like it was so like-- - In the air, bro. - It was so thick.</p><p>Like the cigar smoke was so thick. And then I was lit. I was lit on the way back to the, like my place. So I jumped out of the car. And I was-- - I forgot about that, bro. - I was through the streets. - Yeah. - And like people were double taking.</p><p>They were like, "Oh shit, that's eight." Yo, I said, "Geez, really?" So it went from like 10 people to like 30 people to like 70 people. We were in the streets. And I'm like bodying people, like trying to get through. Like a little kid walked up and I bodied him.</p><p>It was, it was, oh, man.</p></div></div></body></html>
