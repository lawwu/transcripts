So, as mentioned, I'm Paige. I am the engine lead for our DevRel team at Google DeepMind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm here today on behalf of our generative media team, who are all brilliant. They are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">wonderful. Many of them could not be here today. But this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this is all their work. So, I just want to send a thank you to the heavens for everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that they've been building. Today we're going to be talking about three different models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So, VO3, which is our new video and audio generation model. Imagine 4, which can generate these static</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.940</a></span> | <span class="t">images. And also Lyria 2, which is a music generation model. And stay tuned. There will be more of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">all of the above coming shortly. VO is kind of magical in the sense that, you know, you can create videos of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">things that you've never seen before. And we've saw -- we've seen some of these examples already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But it also has the potential to really revolutionize everything that we build and create as humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And I loved this quote from Andre Karpathy just recently. The video has the potential to be an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">incredible surface for communication, but also for education and for human creativity. So, all of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">things are designed with that in mind. VO2, just want to touch on it briefly before we get into the VO3</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">capabilities. We released a whole bunch of additional things around creative control just recently. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">think on the order of about a month ago or not even that. So, things like reference powered videos,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.540</a></span> | <span class="t">videos, out painting, the ability to add and remove objects, character control and consistency,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">which I think you all were talking about just a little while ago. And also the ability to interpolate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">across first and last frames. And let's take a look at what that means. Because for people who are not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">necessarily filmmakers, it's much, much easier to show and not tell. So, reference powered videos are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">things like things like you have a person, you have an environment, and you're able to kind of put one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">within the other or compose them together into something that feels very, very stylized, but also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">like really, really well crafted. So, here you can see reference powered video with VO2. This is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">available via the API and via some of our tools like Flow today. And another example of reference powered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.780</a></span> | <span class="t">video. So, a really, really cute little monster in a variety of environments that you just control</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.540</a></span> | <span class="t">by describing. It's performing pretty well on benchmarks. So, you can see here, the green is VO. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.100</a></span> | <span class="t">compared to things like Runway Gen 4 and Kling, the more green, the better. And for reference powered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.540</a></span> | <span class="t">video, most human readers selected for VO for some of these side by side comparisons. You can also match</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.700</a></span> | <span class="t">styles. So, upload a reference image and then have different styles composed together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Another example of styles being preserved. And then also camera controls the same that you might have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">if you were a filmmaker. So, things like being able to move back, move right, rotate up, zoom in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and to be able to precisely control all of these camera movements. Again, just via natural language and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">through some of the tools that are available in the APIs. When I saw all of this, I was blown</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">away because I don't think that we have nearly enough code samples demonstrating some of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.780</a></span> | <span class="t">capabilities. But these are all things that you can do with the VO2 models today with the APIs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">We also have the ability to do outpainting. This was important for a recent project with the Sphere</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.540</a></span> | <span class="t">around Wizard of Oz. So, being able to take us like a scene or an individual frame of a video</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and imagine what the rest of the scene might look like. So, even if you only have a view into a small</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.140</a></span> | <span class="t">portion, being able to create something that looks real or that looks consistent across the outpainting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Adding objects or removing objects from scenes. So, you can see here a few examples as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, all of these available for you to test and to try today. These are all things that exist</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">that our research team has kind of gotten into the API designs. Some more examples of removing objects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Character control is quite nice. You might have seen some of these demonstrated into your favorite products</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.460</a></span> | <span class="t">for kind of controlling mouth movements, controlling reference space movements for particular characters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We also give the ability to add a script and to add kind of a voice tone and to have the character map</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">the lips to producing that sound and producing it in a way that feels consistent with the location.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">These are some of the motion examples with VO2 and with VO3. So, being able to have an input image</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and controlling them or changing the design across the scene. More benchmarks. And then the first and last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">frame. So, you can have an input image and an output image and VO is able to interpolate across them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.980</a></span> | <span class="t">to kind of make those images stitched together into a video. And those are just another couple of examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like generative media presentations are very gratifying. These are certainly the most beautiful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">things that we get to see at developer conferences. So, VO3. Everything that you just saw, VO2. VO3.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? Like blown away. So, VO3 is video but coupled together with audio. And so, all of the tokens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">composed together natively, not audio being pulled in as a tool, but the model actually able to compose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.140</a></span> | <span class="t">together all of these tokens across multiple modalities. This is similar to what you see with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Gemini's native audio output. In addition to being able to output text and code, you can also output images,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.460</a></span> | <span class="t">edit images, edit audio, compose audio, etc. So, VO3, our latest state-of-the-art video generation model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It has these things around prompt adherence and native audio generation. But again, so much cooler to show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and not tell. The little llama. So, interestingly, you're able to do not just background noises, but also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.740</a></span> | <span class="t">things like music. Including very, very subtle sounds. And the like. So, let's go to the next.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.020</a></span> | <span class="t">VO3. There we go. So, this is hard, right? Like, it looks very cool. It's very hard to capture the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">nuances of an input prompt. And it's also been really historically very hard to preserve visual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.060</a></span> | <span class="t">consistency. So, characters often, like, jump from one frame to another. There might be backgrounds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and then suddenly walls disappear and you're able to see behind them. This is one of the reasons why VO3</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">feels like a leap forward is because the stylistic consistency and then also the contextual consistency</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">is much, much better. Built on years of research. So, things like GQN, WALT, etc. And it has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.140</a></span> | <span class="t">responsibility at its core. So, you can see little human visible watermarks as well as synth ID watermarks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.300</a></span> | <span class="t">for synthetically generated images and video. We've also been partnering really closely with many, many,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">many artists along the way. So, Darren Aronofsky, also musicians for Lyria models, artists for the Imagine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.540</a></span> | <span class="t">models. And we'll take a look at a couple of these as well. So, Imagine is image generation.

And then also being able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">preserve detail across all of these images as well, including diverse styles and even things like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">typography.

And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">also, I'm probably like close to being over time. But I wanted to see how well I could replicate a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">commercial with V.O. that seemed pretty simple. So, the commercial is this one, which took my name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, my name's Paige. And what makes the Chick-fil-A chicken</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that was the, that was the input video. The process for replicating it with V.O.2 is you give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Gemini the original video, have it create a really, really detailed plan. Segment into prompts to like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=1119" target="_blank">00:18:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">handle the eight second limitation. Used music effects to create the background track, which was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.060</a></span> | <span class="t">combination of down home farm and slow guitar. And then put it all in Camtasia, stitch it together with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=1132" target="_blank">00:18:52.540</a></span> | <span class="t">transitions. Whole process was relatively quick, but it also took a lot of thinking and a lot of work to get to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.940</a></span> | <span class="t">that final assembly stage. And it looked like this. So, this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, my name's Paige. And what makes a Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich original to me is the crispiness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.020</a></span> | <span class="t">of the breading and a tenderness of the filet. It's tasty. It's warm. It's total satisfaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was, again, using V.O.2, using Gemini text to speech, and stitching it all together myself. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">actually like that one better than the original commercial, but your mileage may vary. Process with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.140</a></span> | <span class="t">V.O.3. You have the original video, you generate the description, you give it to V.O.3, and you see how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=1179" target="_blank">00:19:39.180</a></span> | <span class="t">well it does. This took just the span of like submitting the prompt to V.O.3. "Hey, my name's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Paige. And what makes the Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich original to me is the crispiness of the breading and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=1192" target="_blank">00:19:52.380</a></span> | <span class="t">the tenderness of the filet." So, again, one prompt. And it was able to produce this. "Hey, my name's Paige. And what makes the Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich original to me is the crispiness of the breading and the tenderness of the filet."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So, again, one prompt.

We're committed to expanding it, expanding access as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.180</a></span> | <span class="t">quick as we can, adding controls around durability. And thank you so much. That is not me actually waving at the camera. That is a static photo of me that has been V.O.3 animated. Excellent. Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=1231" target="_blank">00:20:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcAZ2lX_ZI&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll see you next time.</span></div></div></body></html>
