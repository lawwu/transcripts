I want a variety of different books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's go through it. Here are the five books I read in March of 2022 in order of completion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=41" target="_blank">00:00:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The first was Travels with George. This was written by the popular historian Nathaniel Philbrook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Travels with George is an allusion to Steinbeck's Travels with Charlie.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're a Steinbeck person, you know, Travels with Charlie, Steinbeck is traveling with his dog, Charlie.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, in Travels with George, Nathaniel Philbrook, who's written a series of books about the Revolutionary Era in America, went on a travel with his dog.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in particular, the dog was not named George. In this case, George is George Washington.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Philbrook and his wife and his dog trace the post-inauguration tour of the newly formed country of America that George Washington went on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he did a tour all the way through New England, and then he later did a tour all the way through the South.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Philbrook retraced the steps of that tour in modern times and then went to these went to the spots and then mixed it in like with Steinbeck-esque anecdotes about the journeys and his dog being a pain, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I mean, here's the thing. The book was fine. I think the contemporaneous pieces about the dog, I didn't care.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's like two upper middle-aged people with a dog and the dog gets dirty and it's hard to find hotels for them to stay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't that interesting, but the history is great. I'm a big fan of Philbrook's history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I would have been fine if this book really was just about George Washington's post-inaugurational tours and just honed in right on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I kind of read pretty quickly in the in-betweens. I'm a big Philbrook fan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's what I like about Philbrook. I love writers who live in cool places and write full time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Philbrook, who came to writing late. When I mean late, I'm talking about like Jesse's current decade of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm talking about someone in their 40s. Right. Jesse is all of one day being 40.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're talking people who largely, we would rightly say, have very little productive life left.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But somehow at that point, and it's hard for someone like me in my 30s, again, to really understand what that's like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But somehow at that point, he began writing in his 40s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And his first book was Heart of the Sea about the ship Essex.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this was the ship that was the model for Moby Dick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was a fishing, a whaling boat that was rammed and sunk by a whale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what a great book. And some people survived in a life raft, like a boat, a whaling boat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they were at sea forever. And they ended up on an island. It's all a true story.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's how he like burst onto the scene of doing historical fiction writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But he lives in Nantucket. And that's what I think is cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He lives in Nantucket where he's just a writer on this windswept, you know, island.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I always found that very romantic. But he was a great writer because he's a good he's a good archive guy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you get a little bit of insight in this book about his methods, because in the contemporaneous parts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he's often hanging out with librarians, historical society curators,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and you get a sense into what life is like writing that. It's all about finding primary sources,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">going to historical archives, going to libraries,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">pulling out these books that no one has seen in 75 years to try to piece together the context in which history happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I thought that was cool. So there you go. Good book. Guy lives on Nantucket.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're going to read any Philbrook, start with Heart of the Sea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I also thought Mayflower was very good. Valiant Ambition is very good as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are some recommendations for you. All right. Now we get a little bit weird.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Not weird, but fantasy. And so we got to be careful here, Jesse, that I get all the names right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't know exactly what path led me to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think because I had heard this book was appropriate for younger audiences,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I might have been testing this out for my oldest son.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I have never read Ursula K. Le Guin, and I read her first Earthsea book, A Wizard of Earthsea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a fantasy book written in the 60s. It has a lot of prescience towards Harry Potter, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's a young boy who goes to a school for wizards,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's much more it's much more psychologically astute and sophisticated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not the tale of a boy who's meant to be a hero and has to discover it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's actually the whole metaphor of the book is that through his pride,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he unleashes essentially like a demon force in the world that is hunting him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the end, he has to hunt it down. So it's much more literary,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">much more using language and scene to try to convey a deeper reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Not so plot focused or expository as like a JK Rowling or like a George R.R. Martin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So actually like a really well crafted book in the fantasy genre.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I thought it was quite good. You know, I saw echoes of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You certainly see echoes of it. To me, it wasn't Harry Potter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was thinking more of Love Grossman and the Magicians,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which has a similar sort of literary metaphorical darkness where they sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">unleash this creature from the magical, I don't know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I forgot dimension or something that literally like kills one of the kids at the break</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">beaks at the at the school for wizards. And so clearly Grossman must have been channeling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Ursula K.

I'm not going to let my son read it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's a little more too sophisticated and dark for him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's reading Harry Potter instead. But, you know, it was a good change of pace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I did.

Lots of good old fashioned wizard names.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all like these weird, crazy Dungeons and Dragons names.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.

And there's some good things in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it was the pick and choose, but I mean, I think there are some interesting threads of thought that I hadn't come across before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, here's the most interesting. Here's the headline, like a headline idea that comes out of that book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which probably puts it at odds with a lot of sort of elite discourse around work right now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is Keller finds like a really strong biblical justification for work as an intrinsic good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is quite different than I think a lot of the anti-ambition, anti-productivity type philosophy that's going on now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which sees work as mainly like an exploitative activity to be tolerated at best and in a utopian society to be minimized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Keller comes at it basically saying God worked in Genesis, and that's an argument for work as important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He also has a reading of Genesis that says the seventh day of rest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So God worked and then he rest is basically a biblical mythological recipe for human satisfaction in which you have the seasonality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to work, but then you need to not let work be all consuming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to step back and rest and it's in that dance. And that's what God did during the first seven days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's supposed to be an instruction manual for life. And you see what Adam and Eve and like basically Genesis is like a whole manual for work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I think, you know, Karl Marx's head would explode if he read this because it's, you know, it's, it seems really different than a lot of sort of economic materialistic analyses from today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But wait, cool. It's cool to see. I love people taking big, like big swing thoughts on things that are drawing from interesting sources.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was an interesting one. Then I read the Abolition of Man by C.S. Lewis. It's arguable. This is a book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I thought it was a book I got on Kindle. It's really a collection of three lectures delivered during the World War II.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's pretty short, but let's call it a book. And I forgot how I came across this. I came across it somewhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was like, I should just read it. I just bought it and read it. You know, it took me two days just sort of reading it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not a long thing. And it's interesting. So supposedly this is this book quotation marks collection of speeches is was very influential in the 20th century.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an argument for values, basically having rooted values on which you build cultural social systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an argument against subjectivism. This notion of all value is constructed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's basically like a preemptive rejection of what 30 years later would emerge in French postmodernism before that even existed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm sure this book is not well appreciated by the modern academy, but I think that's what made it interesting to read.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's it's it's jargon free and very approachable. But I mean, you can basically really crudely summarize the argument.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I hate to summarize it crudely, but he's basically making an argument that we have to be careful of the heartless man.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the heartless man, what he means is or no, the man, not the heartless man.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not the right wording. No, the right wording was the man without chest. But what he means by that is heartless.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He says without. A foundation of values, which the heart is, so in other words, like the values that you have, these moral intimations about these moral intuitions that this seems right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you ignore that, you're just trying to use your brain to think through ethics and mediate like and control your gut, which is like, let's go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm mad. Let's go kill this person. I want that to have your animal instincts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you try to just tame that with just your brain, let's just come up with what makes sense from scratch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's do that. Let's be like Kant and just try to construct a moral system from scratch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's arguing that's not going to work. You have to ground it all in what you feel in your heart, this sort of these underlying truth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Lewis is a real obviously a Christian apologist, but he writes this book outside of the context of Christianity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he's trying to be religion agnostic. I mean, it's interesting. I mean, it's something for sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm surprised we don't read it like it in a sort of standard, heavily postmodern influence academic culture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Be a nice thing to assign to people to is like in here is like a like a very straightforward standard critique.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is the this is the tension between those two, the tension between those two things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course, the postmodern view would say there is no underlying value system that you're picking up through your metaphorical heart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all just constructed. It's all just systems that are constructed to support various supremacies and power relations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And C.S. Lewis, if he had been alive, would probably have an issue with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's interesting to read, quick to read, no jargon, very approachable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Final book. And I mentioned this last week in last week's episodes, I actually drew some insights from this book was John McPhee's The Fourth Draft.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll point you towards last week's episodes, I think maybe one eighty five.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I got in I got into some details of some things I learned from the book. It's great. It's a John McPhee book about writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A little bit of memoir, a lot of craft, very interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You'll be impressed by McPhee after you read it. You'll also be insanely jealous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, wait a second, you get to spend eight months just thinking about an article and and then, you know, maybe at some point write it when it all feels right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like it feels like a very it feels like a very cool life. Like I can't be jealous. I can't complain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=810" target="_blank">00:13:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I write for The New Yorker. They're very generous and giving me flexibility and timing when I need it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'm not I'm not complaining. I'm saying it's awesome. And John McPhee's awesome. It's a cool book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're into nonfiction writing, you can get a look inside the mind of a master.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So, Jesse, those are my five books. People like to know what you read.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fNSDaspRA&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Give us one book, Jesse.
