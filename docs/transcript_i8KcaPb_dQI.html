Like how do public intellectuals make themselves focal points? Well, by doing something noteworthy, right? So it can be an idea, but it can also be a form of performance art. A lot of the IDW people have very clear peaks, which now lie in the past, and I suspect will have fairly rapid declines.</p><p>What do you think? What's the explanation for why they peak so early? I don't know if early is the word. Like Jordan Peterson was at it for a long time, but they made extreme bets on very particular ideas, and maybe different people will disagree about those ideas, but I think a lot of them are losing ideas, even if they might be correct in some ways.</p><p>I've done much less to bet on a single idea. You can say kind of market-based economics, but it's not so radical. Maybe it's not peak fashion now, but it's fine to be doing that. They were over leveraged and they got margin called.</p></div></div></body></html>
