Coach Pete says, is listening to audio books just as beneficial as reading actual hard copy books? Uh, yeah, just read a lot, read a wide variety, use a lot of formats. It's all good. It's all good. I just think reading is calisthenics for your brain.</p><p>It opens up your brain. It's also the source of raw ideas and vocabulary and even argument structure. It is the grist that you then chew up in your brain to make that brain way more effective. So I just say, read as much as you can and don't sweat the details.</p><p>This is why you'll see, for example, when I do my monthly report on the books, I read that, you know, I'm all over the place, a huge variety of different topics, and I don't care. I just, let's go, let's read, you know, let's just, let's just have it going.</p><p>And I think it's the same thing as if you're, if you want to just be generally in shape, do a bunch of different things. Bike, I row, I lift weights, I do calisthenics, I do some CrossFit, I'm playing on an ultimate Frisbee team. You just throw a bunch of stuff at it.</p><p>It's good for you. ♪  ♪ (upbeat music)</p></div></div></body></html>
