So yes, the return expectations of the stock market,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQyuTKJwWzU&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe 5%, 7%, 8%. But it's very easy to maintain a job and do that on the side because there's no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQyuTKJwWzU&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">work. Is the amount of work you need to go buy a boring business, a laundromat or something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQyuTKJwWzU&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">enough that you don't need to quit your job? Can it be a side hustle? Or how full time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQyuTKJwWzU&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is doing this type of investing? I think it's very similar to rental</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQyuTKJwWzU&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">properties, right? What sucks about getting rental properties? Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQyuTKJwWzU&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">first you have to understand the market. You got to understand what's a good buy, what's a bad buy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQyuTKJwWzU&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you've got to actually get a mortgage. You've got to figure out what that looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQyuTKJwWzU&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you have to figure out how to get somebody to rent your property out. But after you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQyuTKJwWzU&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that first period of understanding, you either Airbnb it out with some consistency or you get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQyuTKJwWzU&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a property manager that manages it, right? And I think it's really similar to businesses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQyuTKJwWzU&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Depending on the size and scale and type, you can have a business that's less active.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQyuTKJwWzU&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I try to not say passive because I think that's a fallacy overall, but that's less active.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQyuTKJwWzU&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And those businesses are, I think, all around. I use the example of car washes and laundromats</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQyuTKJwWzU&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and vending machines. Less because they're incredibly passive, but more because I call</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQyuTKJwWzU&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">them the gateway drug businesses. So basically, you can get your little skin in the game. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQyuTKJwWzU&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">can get your little first hit of being in business and being the owner. And then as you do that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQyuTKJwWzU&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you're like, "Oh, wait, this game is kind of fun.
