target="_blank">00:00:45.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's start out with just a quick primer on what is BlackRock and what is Aladdin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">BlackRock is one of the world's beating asset managers.</span></div><div

Aladdin platform is key to our ability to be able to deliver on that goal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Aladdin is a proprietary technology platform that unifies the investment management process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:01:30.540</a></span> | <span class="t">This system is built by the industry for the industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">BlackRock is the biggest user of Aladdin, but we also sell and support hundreds of clients globally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.700</a></span> | <span class="t">across 70 countries, all using the Aladdin platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.940</a></span> | <span class="t">The

target="_blank">00:01:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and these engineers build and maintain the around 100 Aladdin front-end applications that thousands</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of people can use every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.700</a></span> | <span class="t">We see three key outcomes at the BlackRock firm level.</span></div><div

productivity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.500</a></span> | <span class="t">We would love for AI to try an alpha generation and really give people a much more personalized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">experience with the platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">One way we're realizing this is through the Aladdin co-pilot initiative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The Aladdin co-pilot application is currently embedded across all of those 100 front-end applications</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that are covered through the network.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This co-pilot acts as the connective tissue across the Aladdin platform, proactively servicing relevant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">content for you at the right moment and fostering productivity at each step along the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We like to think about three, four value drivers within the scope of Aladdin co-pilot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">The first is that we want every user using the Aladdin software to become an Aladdin expert.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can do that by enabling a much more intuitive approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">The second is really has to do with increasing the personalization and customization of this platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And through that, our users will be able to unlock new efficiencies to highly configurable experiences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And the third one is really just to democratize access to all of these insights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.740</a></span> | <span class="t">If our users, if it is much easier for our users to find the data, the data points that they need,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">then they will, at the end of the day, be much more enabled to make a lot better decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So here is a high-level overview of the actual architecture supporting the Aladdin co-pilot today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll take you through kind of the life cycle of a user query.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Before I dive into that, I want to point your attention to the top right here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And this component is called Plugin Ventures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I referenced this earlier, but there are, let's say, 50, 60 Aladdin engineering teams</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.820</a></span> | <span class="t">that cover specific domains throughout the platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You can think of an example of one of these teams, maybe the trading team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">They own all of the services that serve trading data to all Aladdin applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Pedro and I are not experts in these, you know, business, financial domains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Our job is to make it as easy as possible for these engineers to plug their functionality</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that they own into this system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And we do that through this plug-in registry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Today, we allow these development teams two ways to onboard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The first, we come to define a tool as kind of mapping one-to-one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">through an existing Aladdin API already out in production.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the second onboarding path that we give to these development teams</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">for a very complex workflows is the ability to spin up a custom agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and also plug that into the system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one important call-out here, we kind of started designing this thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">two and a half years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And back then, we needed to figure out kind of a standardized agentic communication protocol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And we, you know, we came up with a very slim, very specific version of that for Aladdin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But as new, more established protocols like PlanChain's agent protocol and 8A come out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">we're kind of actively evaluating those solutions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So now I can point your attention to the left side of the screen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not in the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to start out with a query of what is my exposure to aerospace in portfolio one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">At this point in time, when the user submits their query, we have a lot of very useful and relevant context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of those could be which Aladdin application they're asking this question from,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what they actually have up on the screen, what portfolios, what assets, what widgets are they actually looking at at that point in time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And in addition to that, there's also kind of this set of predefined global settings throughout these Aladdin apps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And ideally, we are respecting those preferences as we make all these calls on behalf of the user.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So once a query gets submitted, we enter our orchestration graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">From day one, it's been built using LinkChain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first node in that graph is an input card drill node.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And it covers a lot of the needs for our responsible AI moderation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">At this point in the graph, we're trying to find off-topic and toxic content and deal with the program needs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">We would also, at this point, find what data file of relevant PII and make sure that we're handling that as carefully as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So once we get to that node, we go into this filtering and access control node.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And at that, that's the point in time where we have this, you know, set of agents and tools,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">a couple thousand agents and tools that are registered in the plugin registry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">When teams onboard this functionality to the registry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">they have complete control over which environment, environments this plugin is enabled in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">which users have access to this, and even which Aladdin apps can even access these plugins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Within this node, we also, it's important for us to try our best to decrease the kind of searchable universe of all of these plugins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Because once we get to our planning step, you know, if we're sending more than 40, 50 tools,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we probably won't have that good enough control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So we leave that filtering and access control node with some set of, say, 20 to 30 tools and agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And we enter our orchestration node.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There, we're very reliant on GPT-4 function calling today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We essentially just iterate over a planning and action node.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">We go through that as many times as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And at some point, you know, GPT-4 says, hey, you got the answer.</span></div><div

answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We get that final answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.140</a></span> | <span class="t">We pass it back out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You're out of the card rail nodes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Trying to protect hallucinations

on the left side and tell the users that their exposure to the air is mostly effective in this portfolio is 5%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a bit of high-level information on the architecture of the system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to pass the pager here to talk about how we think about evaluating the system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so I think, like, one thing is obvious from the presentations that we've been seeing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, we're all using Supervisor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, like, I've seen very little agent-to-agent autonomous conversations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And we are just one more of those presentations using Supervisor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Why?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it's very easy to build.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very easy to complete it, but it's very easy to test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So hopefully, hopefully next year we are doing lots of those agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But how do we evaluate the system that we just presented?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Brendan walked you through the life cycle of the query.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.080</a></span> | <span class="t">There's many places where you can make a wrong decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.060</a></span> | <span class="t">It can be in the initial moderation, in the card rails, in the visual components of the card rails.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">On the filtering, did we not produce the universe correctly?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Did the orchestra work on turn at some point?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.340</a></span> | <span class="t">All the way back to the hallucination block, something that was not actually hallucination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, so much, so much, so many systems in place of how exactly do we gain confidence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">This, this a lot of the puzzle is deployed in all our clients.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is actually production, orchestration, built on a line, right, like, like Brendan said.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is just an example of a lens with trace, just for one single tool call, right, like we go to input card rails, filtering, planning, the actual tool calling, communicating with the other agents, coming back, planning, let's see if we answer the question, some output card rails, custom to our domain, and hallucination checks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we first start with system prompts, and I know we've been hearing about evaluation, we're going to keep telling you, I think, the same lessons are learned across all of us, I think it's very evident that, similar to how in traditional coding you are doing as human development, it's no different in the world of LLMs, you have to do evaluation of the development.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, one of the things where we start is the LLMs, where are we calling LLMs, we have a system prompt, why are we writing what we are writing in that system prompt to begin with?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what we do is, we are, and you can find us after all, so we are very paranoid about telling the user the wrong things, so we start by testing every single behavior that we are intending by writing that in the system prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, if I write, you're all equal value, you must never provide investment advice, what is investment advice, I need to generate a lot of synthetic data, I need to generate a lot of data with the subject matter experts, I need to call it all of that and build an evaluation platform and make sure that we are never going to give investment advice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, this is a very dummy example, but we do this for every system prompt, we do this for every intended behavior, we put into our system prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I know I guess, but we don't want to have a Chevrolet bone or something, right, so, for that, we have a lot of LLMs in the judge to specifically evaluate that we are doing the right thing, so we do this for every system prompt that we have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.540</a></span> | <span class="t">At the end of the day, we have a report. This is a very important part of our CI/CD pipeline, it runs every day, it runs on every PR. Why?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Because we are a bunch of developers, every day we are improving the system, every day we are releasing to our development environment, and you want to know if you're breaking stuff, you want to know if you're reducing the performance of the system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I know it's very easy to chase your own tail with LLM, so this is exactly what lets us go really fast in the area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this is only the system prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.860</a></span> | <span class="t">When we talk about the orchestration, agent-to-agent communication, agent-to-API, how do we make sure that we fill out the right parameters in those API calls,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that we send the right tracing to the other agents in that communication, then it's when we get this end-to-end testing capability to all the allotting developers and engineers that we have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we start with the configuration later, and this is what we allow developers to basically configure the testing scenario.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a lot of applications, like Brendan said, what allotting application are you in? What is the user seeing in that stream content? What portfolios are loaded? What assets are loaded? What widgets are enabled?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Then, in the application context, they often have some settings in the system that they want respected. We need to make sure that we take those into account during the planning phase when calling those APIs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And, of course, we allow them to customize multi-trance scenarios for that testing. Like, for example, here's a little bit of history, the query, and the final response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is for the configuration layer, the query, the response, the chat history, and in the next step, we ask them to provide us the solution layer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, for every plugin that comes into a system, we ask them for parameters. That's basically how me and Brendan are able to guarantee that allotting the product is going to be performing and be able to route in whatever scenario, in whatever context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we are very dependent on that capture data. And, in the solution layer, it's where they give us how are we supposed to solve the user query that you're giving us in that graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It might take separate threats. It might take separate unrelated threats. So, for example, in Threat 1, I need to get an exposure. In Threat 2, I need to get how much can they actually, let's say, buy it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to know how much of BlackRock you can buy in your portfolio. I need to know how many shares I can buy to be compliant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I need to know how much cash I have in that portfolio. So, this structure allows us to test those interactions, multi-step, multi-turn, and have some confidence in our system that we're doing the right thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And, there's the little Apple accounts that's being used to sign into any of those types of data here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's not letting me change. But anyway, the next slide is basically just a lesson like this end-to-end about we run this every day, every night to make sure we're routing correctly, to make sure that we are solving the queries correctly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We tell the teams today, this is how we're performing for you. This is how we're performing for you. So, we're working on federating the agent to development of the data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Can they fix it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. So, all of this is just to say, as many of us have been saying, that evaluation during development is very important, because, especially when you're trying to federate in a large enterprise, otherwise, hey, my individual query is not working, hey, this other query is not working, you need a statistical way of saying that your system is working, is improved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not deteriorating, it's not deteriorating, so that you can continue to build the scalable products. Otherwise, it's very hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So, again, I think like the biggest lesson I have as an engineering lead in the organization is that having this as part of your, having this end-to-end evaluation as part of your CI/CD processes, it's very important for you to know what your business is doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avZckMGnOvY&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">That being said, yeah, thank you so much.</span></div></div></body></html>
