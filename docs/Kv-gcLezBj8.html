So that's why I'm going to do a deep dive into their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">card lineup. And as I do it, I'm going to be filling out a tier list where I rank all the cards. So for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.060</a></span> | <span class="t">those not familiar with tier lists, the highest tier is S. Maybe that means special or super. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.820</a></span> | <span class="t">not entirely clear. Followed by a traditional A, B, C, D letter grade. And if anyone out there is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">asking if I'm just doing this episode because Citi is having some big affiliate deal where I get paid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.540</a></span> | <span class="t">lots of money for referrals, that unfortunately couldn't be farther from the truth because despite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that I do have links for Citi cards on the website, none of them are affiliate links or even referral</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">links. So even if every single one of you listening opens up a Citi card, I won't earn a thing or get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">any benefit. I genuinely just wanted to do this episode because I opened two Citi cards after going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">deep on the program and I feel like I was missing out. Finally, in addition to Citi, I think I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to make this a recurring series where I break down all the cards from every major issuer. So please,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">if you have feedback on that concept, you can send me an email, podcast at allthehacks.com or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">on the website, use the contact form. So let's get into it. Citi has a ton of cards. According to their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">website, there are 24 of them. I'm going to focus on the ones that are most interesting because there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.460</a></span> | <span class="t">are a ton of cards where it's random stuff like the L.L. Bean MasterCard, the Dillard's card and those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">things. It's not that you might not get value if you really care about those retailers, but they're a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit of an edge case. So I'm going to skip those and start with the thank you points earning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.460</a></span> | <span class="t">cards. I think Citi thank you points is a really competitive program. They've got a ton of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">transfer partners, some that are unique and have better earning rates or transfer rates than other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">programs. So the marquee card in the thank you point ecosystem is the Citi Strata Premier card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.260</a></span> | <span class="t">This is one of the two cards I recently opened up and I've been pretty impressed with its earning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So two big highlights for this card is the signup bonus, which is often 75,000 points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.220</a></span> | <span class="t">though right now at recording, it's 60,000 points after spending 4K in three months. And then the big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">other one is the earnings. You get 3x points on groceries, gas, dining, hotel, and airfare. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.020</a></span> | <span class="t">those are a few of the major categories that people spend money on. You do also get 10x points on hotels,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">car rentals, and attractions through Citi travel, which is a bit of a recurring theme in a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">these cards. But as I've talked about in a lot of previous episodes, I don't love booking in the travel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">portal unless there's a bigger incentive. So I kind of write that off. The card does have a $95 annual fee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">To make up for that, they give you a $100 credit towards a hotel stay in Citi travel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">as long as you spend more than $500. I have not yet decided whether I'm ever even going to use that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">credit. I don't know if, you know, 20% off one stay ends up, and obviously that's only if you hit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">exactly $500. I don't know if that ends up being worth the downsides of booking in the travel portal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It earns 1x points on everything else. It has no foreign transaction fees. And while many Citi cards,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I will knock for not having travel protections and purchase protections, this card does have some.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">They are not as strong as the ones you'll see from other major issuers. But they do have trip delay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">trip interruption, lost luggage, damaged luggage, and rental car coverage, though that rental car</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.020</a></span> | <span class="t">coverage is secondary to your primary insurance. And then they do have purchase protection, but it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">also limited. They've got extended warranty of an additional two years, and then damage and theft</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">protection for 90 days. So it has some protections, but not nearly as much as other cards. But the real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">marquee thing is that you're earning 3x on groceries, gas, dining, hotel, and airfare.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So for me, if I jump into my little tier list, I think this is a really, really great card. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">putting this one in the S tier because those categories, earning 3x transferable points in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">program for a $95 fee card with a decent signup bonus is just about everything I'm looking for. And I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">been using the card a ton in the last few weeks, both to hit the signup bonus and because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.980</a></span> | <span class="t">3x in those categories is pretty compelling. Interestingly enough, despite that City has a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">ton of cards, only three of them really earn thank you points that are transferable. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">others earn are marketed as cash back. But if you have the City Strata Premier, you can transfer those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">points. The next few cards on the list are sometimes marketed as earning thank you points, sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.300</a></span> | <span class="t">marketed as earning cash back, but they don't always come with the ability to transfer unless they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.780</a></span> | <span class="t">paired with the Strata Premier. Or if you're a legacy City card holder and you have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">City Prestige card, they're also able to be transferred to airlines. And that's where you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.860</a></span> | <span class="t">get a lot of the value out of it. I think you could get a ton of value from City as just a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">pure cash back play. And we'll get to that. But the transfer partners are pretty interesting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">especially when you pair up a couple cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">The next card I'm going to mention is a surprisingly interesting one. And that is the AT&T points plus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">card. This one is marketed as earning thank you points, which is why I'm doing it next.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It is not that compelling. The signup bonus is $200 on $1,000 of spend in three months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">There is no annual fee, does have a 3% foreign transaction fee. You get 3x points on gas and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">EV charging and 2x on grocery. I think you do better than that on a lot of cards. If you are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">an AT&T customer, you do save $20 a month up to $240 a year on this card. So I could make an argument</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that a card that earns you $240 a year is interesting with no annual fee. But one, you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">probably spending way more than $240 a year having AT&T in the first place. So you'd be better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">switching. But it is a points earning card. So I feel like it is worth mentioning in the list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But I am unfortunately going to put this card in the C tier list. And you'll see what D entails in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">moment. But you know, C tier for the purposes of this episode is not a compelling place to live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Next card, there was a Sears card for a long time that Citi had. It actually had a bunch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting benefits. I'm not going to go deep into those because on April 12, they kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">effectively killed that card and said it is now going to be what's called the Citi Thank You Master</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Card. Now you can't get that card. So there's not an interesting website about it. And a lot of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting deals from that card are no longer going to be issued. So if you like these earning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">perks that it had, the Citi Shop Your Way card is going to be interesting. And we'll get to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">This card is not that interesting. I'm going to go ahead and put it in the D tier because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">there's really nothing about this card that's compelling anymore at all. But the next card I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">really big fan of. And in fact, if I get another Citi card, this one's what's coming next. And that is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Citi Double Cash card. Now you've probably seen tons of ads for this card. It is a 2% unlimited cashback</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">card. It's marketed as you get 1% when you spend the money and 1% when you pay it off. So I guess if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.860</a></span> | <span class="t">don't pay off your credit card, it's only a 1% card. But if you don't pay off your credit card, you should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.020</a></span> | <span class="t">ignore this entire episode. Stop listening and focus your strategy on paying down credit cards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">because unless they're a 0% interest card, credit card debt is just not worth any amount of rewards,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">any amount of points. In addition to that, it is no annual fee. It has a minor signup bonus. You get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">$200 after spending $1,500 in six months, at least as of recording this, though it does come with a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">foreign transaction fee. So while it's a great everything card, it is not a great everything card when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.220</a></span> | <span class="t">you're traveling overseas. And if you have the Citi Strata Premier card, then the cashback can be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">converted into points that can be transferred. So really great card to pair. In a way, if you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the Strata Premier, it's similar to the Capital One Venture X card or Venture card in that you get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.080</a></span> | <span class="t">2x transferable points on every purchase. It has no travel protection and the only purchase protection</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.260</a></span> | <span class="t">it has is an extended warranty. So not the best card to be using for those kinds of purchase</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">protections at all. And definitely not a card to put a lot of travel on it. Though for this year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">they're offering 5% back on stuff booked in city travel, hotel, rental car and attractions, not airfare.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So on its own, 2% cashback card, you know, with Robinhood out there with the Smartly card, though, it just kind of got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">knocked down pretty hard with Bank of America with Platinum Honors. There's a ton of cards out there that you could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.700</a></span> | <span class="t">earning more than 2%. But if you get the Premier and you get 2x transferable points, kind of interesting, not even kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting, really interesting. So I'm going to put this in A tier because I think that it is a compelling card to have if you're in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">city ecosystem. And then last one in this group is the city custom cash card. On the surface, this card looks amazing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">because you get 5% back on whatever category you spend the most in. And the categories are really wide ranging restaurants, gas,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">grocery, travel, transit, streaming, drug stores, home improvement, fitness clubs and live entertainment. And home improvement is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">probably the most notable one in here for me because I'm not aware of any other card that has a elevated earnings potential for that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">category. However, you're capped at only earning that 5% back on up to $500 per billing cycle, which means that you're only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.220</a></span> | <span class="t">getting it on $6,000 a year. And so if you look at earning 5% on $6,000 or earning 5% on a 2x unlimited card, you're just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">getting a bonus of 3%. And so that's really just a max of $180 a year. Now, if you have the City Strata Premier, then that could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">18,000 points a year over having the double cash. But where this kind of gets interesting, and we'll talk later about how City allows you to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">product change between different cards, you could have multiple of these custom cash cards. So I do know a few people who ended up with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.140</a></span> | <span class="t">two or three or four of them. And they're like, this is my gas card. This is my travel card. This is my transit card. And if you figure you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.780</a></span> | <span class="t">don't spend more than $500 during a billing cycle on gas, then this is effectively a 5x points on gas card. And I'm not familiar with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">another 5x transferable points gas card. So I do think that if you're in the City ecosystem, the City custom cash card is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.020</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty good. I'm going to put it at B tier, because it's not quite that exciting with the cap of earning only $500 of 5x a month. But it does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">have no annual fee. So that's nice. Similar, you get no travel or purchase protection except extended warranty to the double cash</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">also has a 3% foreign transaction fee. And I'm not sure why this card is different in this way. But you do get 5x or 5% back on all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">same hotel rental car attractions and city travel. But for this card, it's through June 30th, 2026. I have no idea why they're doing these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.820</a></span> | <span class="t">promotions on different schedules. So those are the main cards in the City thank you point or cashback ecosystem. The next I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">going to go into is the American Airlines ecosystem. So if you have no interest in American, though, maybe I will change your mind. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">could skip through this time. Timestamps are in the show notes. But I will say one two things. One, as I've dug into Alaska Airlines, I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.840</a></span> | <span class="t">noticed that American Airlines status is also pretty beneficial to Alaska Airlines. And American Airlines is one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">easiest statuses to earn without needing to ever fly American. So if you don't fly a lot, or you're always flying on cheap</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">seats, you don't think you're ever going to earn the status, you can spend your way to American status better than almost any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">other program out there. And if you fly Alaska a lot, American status gives you very, very similar comparable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">benefits. Whereas Alaska is much harder to spend your way to status, especially because they cap how many elite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">qualifying points you can even earn using an Alaska card to earn status. So I'll run through the four city</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">cards. And I'll tell you why one of them is the second card I got, and is very lucrative in 2025. And I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">actually really excited about it. And I'll get there. This episode is brought to you by Thrive Market.

If you were a major spender</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.840</a></span> | <span class="t">at grocery stores, or there were gift cards or things that you were buying at grocery stores,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and your primary spending category is groceries, then if you were also trying to get American status,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.260</a></span> | <span class="t">then spending on this card would be more lucrative than the other cards because you'd be earning 2x</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">American points.

So if you're doing round trip with a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">family of four checking four bags, that's $320 saved, you get preferred boarding and another 25% off food and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">beverage on American. So interesting if you're going for status interesting if you want to sign up bonus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">though I'd hold out for something like 75,000 points on this card. But if you do fly American a lot, but not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">enough to earn status, I would say getting free checked bags is a decent perk for this card. But if you fly American</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot, I imagine you would have status or you'd want one of the other cards in this platform. So I'm going to put this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">at a C tier. I think it's better than the mile up card, but not nearly as good as the next two on the list. So on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.940</a></span> | <span class="t">personal side, the next one's the city executive American card, much higher signup bonus, though much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.740</a></span> | <span class="t">higher annual fee. So it's $595 for the card. It's got a 70,000 point signup bonus right now on spending</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">$7,000 in three months has no foreign transaction fees. But it's pretty interesting for a few reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1089" target="_blank">00:18:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So not necessarily on the earning, because the only elevated earning is 5x on American if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">spend $150,000 on the card, but that's a tremendous amount. It does also earn 10x on hotels and car</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">rentals through the city portal.

The reason to get this card is twofold. One, you get an Admirals Club membership. So if you travel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">American a lot, because one of the requirements for an Admirals Club membership to go in is to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1120" target="_blank">00:18:40.340</a></span> | <span class="t">be flight American, or if you fly on Alaska, because the Admirals Club membership also allows you access</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.100</a></span> | <span class="t">to the Alaska lounge, and there's currently not a credit card that gives you access to Alaska lounge,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.460</a></span> | <span class="t">this could be a really interesting card. You can go into those lounges with your family, adult spouse,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1134" target="_blank">00:18:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and children, or up to two guests. And the really interesting thing about this card, if you have a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1140" target="_blank">00:19:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">friends that are all interested, is you can add up to three authorized users on the card for $175 total.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you had one person and three authorized users, and you all split the total annual fees,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you'd be spending $192 a year for American Admirals Club access.

And one caveat is the Admirals Club</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.580</a></span> | <span class="t">access you get as an authorized user does not allow you into the Alaska lounge. So only the primary user</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.740</a></span> | <span class="t">gets that Alaska lounge perk.

Other perks, you get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">your first bag free this time for up to eight travelers.

Some other airlines do have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">that requirement. You get priority check-in, screening, and boarding. And then they have a bunch of coupon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1204" target="_blank">00:20:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">style credits. And this is not uncommon for premium cards these days. I'm going to say these credits are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">not as valuable as some other ones. But it really depends on how you travel and spend money. You get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.100</a></span> | <span class="t">$120 a year for booking Avis and budget car rentals and paying for them directly on the card. You get $10</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1221" target="_blank">00:20:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a month for $120 a year on Grubhub. To me, it feels like those two would be reasonably easy to use. We do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1227" target="_blank">00:20:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">use Grubhub probably once a month. But if we had this card, we'd be doing it twice. So twice a month. I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1233" target="_blank">00:20:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">know if we use it that much. And then you get $10 a month credit with Lyft, but only after three rides</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1238" target="_blank">00:20:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">each month. So I think that for us would be really hard to use. And then you get TSA Global Entry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1243" target="_blank">00:20:43.980</a></span> | <span class="t">covered, which for someone playing this game, I'm guessing you already have a card that covers that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1249" target="_blank">00:20:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So those credits to me aren't worth nearly what they're marketed as. But the other big benefit here...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1255" target="_blank">00:20:55.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if we go back to American status, I was saying that the base level status, you need 40,000 loyalty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1259" target="_blank">00:20:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">points. The next level is 75,000. And the next level is 125. One of the things this card offers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">even without spending money on the card, is that after you earn 50,000 loyalty points with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1271" target="_blank">00:21:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">American, holding this card gives you an extra 10,000.

So if you're really making a go for American status, this card is pretty interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1301" target="_blank">00:21:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">The only other perks that it has are World Elite MasterCard perks, which any World Elite MasterCard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">would have. There are some discounts and statuses with maybe some rental cars and stuff like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1313" target="_blank">00:21:53.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Nothing too compelling, but you can go search World Elite MasterCard and look at those perks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1317" target="_blank">00:21:57.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So for this card, I think that if you travel American, getting lounge access potentially for up to four</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.540</a></span> | <span class="t">people is pretty compelling. So I'd put it at A tier. Obviously, if you don't fly American ever,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1329" target="_blank">00:22:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">all of these American cards are going to be D tier. But the last one I want to mention is probably my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1335" target="_blank">00:22:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">favorite and the one I recently got, which is the Advantage Business Platinum card. And the reason it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1340" target="_blank">00:22:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting might not be interesting every year and might only be interesting this year, but it has the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1345" target="_blank">00:22:25.740</a></span> | <span class="t">highest signup bonus of all the cards right now. So that's interesting. 75,000 after spending 5K in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1351" target="_blank">00:22:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">five months. It also has a $99 annual fee, but the first year is free. So that's interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1358" target="_blank">00:22:38.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You got no foreign transaction fees, which is interesting. And then on the benefits side,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1363" target="_blank">00:22:43.100</a></span> | <span class="t">you get first bag free for up to four people. And then if you spend $30,000, you get a companion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.860</a></span> | <span class="t">certificate, which is $99 plus taxes and fees for a companion. So out the gate, it is a similar price</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1375" target="_blank">00:22:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">to the personal platinum card. But I think it's a lot better for two reasons. You do earn 2x on rental</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">car and gas, but also 2x on telecom, cable and satellite. So if you're spending your bills on phone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1390" target="_blank">00:23:10.700</a></span> | <span class="t">bills and cable bills, you can earn a little bit of extra American points. But the most interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.460</a></span> | <span class="t">thing is as a business card, it has a couple unique features. So one thing that's very different about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1402" target="_blank">00:23:22.700</a></span> | <span class="t">the way American business cards work than almost every other one is that if you add an authorized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.220</a></span> | <span class="t">employee and that employee is using the card, the loyalty points accrue to the employee, not to the primary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1415" target="_blank">00:23:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">cardholder. So if you want to earn status, you want to use the primary card. But the miles from both</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">primary and authorized users all accrue to an advantage business account. And that advantage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1426" target="_blank">00:23:46.700</a></span> | <span class="t">business account can choose who to transfer those miles to. So in effect, you get this new account that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">lets you dole out those miles to any of the employees or authorized users on the card. However,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1437" target="_blank">00:23:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">there is a promotion in 2025. And it says it's targeted, but I did never got an email about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1443" target="_blank">00:24:03.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And I see it in my promotions tab. And I've heard pretty much everyone has been targeted for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1448" target="_blank">00:24:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">promotion. And it was also effective last year that all the authorized user or employee cards that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1454" target="_blank">00:24:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">earning loyalty points for themselves, the primary cardholder will also get those loyalty points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1460" target="_blank">00:24:20.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Meaning if you need to spend in America's platform $75,000 to earn platinum status, if you do it on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1469" target="_blank">00:24:29.260</a></span> | <span class="t">authorized employee card, then the primary user and the employee or authorized user get that status</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1475" target="_blank">00:24:35.980</a></span> | <span class="t">because they're both accruing the loyalty points. So if you and any other person are both gunning for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1481" target="_blank">00:24:41.900</a></span> | <span class="t">American status, this card is excellent because it effectively lets you spend once and earn those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1488" target="_blank">00:24:48.940</a></span> | <span class="t">loyalty points for two people. So I was a little torn on this. If you're going for American status,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1494" target="_blank">00:24:54.220</a></span> | <span class="t">this card has to be S tier because it lets you earn status for two people at the same time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1499" target="_blank">00:24:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But I still don't think the earnings is that exciting. And so, and not everyone's going for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1504" target="_blank">00:25:04.780</a></span> | <span class="t">American status and not everyone wants a business card and not everyone is trying to get status for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.740</a></span> | <span class="t">two people. Because if you are in a family and you're often traveling together, we don't really need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1514" target="_blank">00:25:14.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the status for both of you.

Your status will let others board with you. So I'm going to put this in a tier,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1523" target="_blank">00:25:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">but I think that it's definitely the best of the American cards, unless you really rely on lounge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">access, which by the way, at some tier of milestone perks, meaning as you earn loyalty points, you get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1535" target="_blank">00:25:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">perks. One of those benefits is an admiral's club membership. So there is a way to spend your way to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1542" target="_blank">00:25:42.060</a></span> | <span class="t">an admiral's club membership through loyalty points. It's going to be a lot more loyalty points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1546" target="_blank">00:25:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">but it is an option without having that executive card. Okay. Next, I want to talk about the Costco</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1552" target="_blank">00:25:52.460</a></span> | <span class="t">cards. Um, I think they're really interesting because people seem to love them, but I just don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1558" target="_blank">00:25:58.860</a></span> | <span class="t">see it. I just don't get it for myself. I don't get it for almost anyone. They have no signup bonus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">They have no annual fee though. You do need a Costco membership. So in order to get the card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1568" target="_blank">00:26:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">you need to have a Costco membership, which does have an annual fee. And if you're going for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1571" target="_blank">00:26:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">business card, the only real difference I can find between the personal and the business Costco cards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.860</a></span> | <span class="t">is that if you have authorized users on the business card, they all need Costco membership.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1581" target="_blank">00:26:21.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can't just add any authorized user. You need to add an authorized user who already has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1586" target="_blank">00:26:26.060</a></span> | <span class="t">their own Costco membership.

So if you're getting this for gas, I would get the city custom cash.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1638" target="_blank">00:27:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You're, you're only missing out on an extra $1,000 of an extra, something like, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">3% $30.

And by the way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1875" target="_blank">00:31:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">it has no annual fee. I didn't look, but I would be shocked if it didn't have foreign transaction fees</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1879" target="_blank">00:31:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">because it doesn't seem like a travel focused card. So let's assume it has 3% foreign transaction fees,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1885" target="_blank">00:31:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">which it does. Um, and, and here's what happens. I've got a few examples from a few people who reported</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1893" target="_blank">00:31:33.100</a></span> | <span class="t">the thing that's interesting about this card is all the deals that it sends</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1896" target="_blank">00:31:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">to you sometime in a three to four month window after having the card, but there's no guarantee you'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1904" target="_blank">00:31:44.060</a></span> | <span class="t">get them. But it seems pretty consistent that people three, four or five months into this card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1908" target="_blank">00:31:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">start getting very lucrative offers. So one person reported that the initial offers they got a few months</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1914" target="_blank">00:31:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">into the card. They got three of them. One was 20% off a hundred dollars plus on utilities for three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1921" target="_blank">00:32:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">months in a row up to $75 back a month. So if you spent a full $375 each month in utilities,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1928" target="_blank">00:32:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">you'd get 75 back each month for $225. They got a 10% off $400 or more each month at gas stations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1936" target="_blank">00:32:16.460</a></span> | <span class="t">grocery stores, and restaurants combined with a max of 150 back. So if you spent $1,500 three months in a row,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1943" target="_blank">00:32:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">you'd get 150 back each month for $450 total. And then last, they got $125 off spending 2000 a month</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1951" target="_blank">00:32:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">on anything. And these, my understanding is these all stack. So if you've got 2000, spend 2000, get 125</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1957" target="_blank">00:32:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">back and spend 400 plus on these four categories, you can combine them. And so that ends up being over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1965" target="_blank">00:32:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">three months. Uh, you have three months to hit that spend. You end up getting $125 back on 2k of spend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1972" target="_blank">00:32:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So in total for $5,625 of spend, they got $800 back, which is 14.2% back. Plus they got all the regular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1984" target="_blank">00:33:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">earning from the card, which for the most categories is just one X points. Uh, but maybe that bumps it up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1990" target="_blank">00:33:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">to 15% back and that's on 5,000 of spend. So a free $800 in a quarter. And I, and I say free,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=1997" target="_blank">00:33:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously they had to do this spend. There was an opportunity cost of this spend, but 14% with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2003" target="_blank">00:33:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">with the regular spending, maybe 15% back on, uh, five grand is not nothing. Another person got a bunch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2010" target="_blank">00:33:30.700</a></span> | <span class="t">offers in Q4, which was 50 off a thousand dollars online. It's about 5%. Another $200 off a thousand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2018" target="_blank">00:33:38.460</a></span> | <span class="t">dollars online. And then another 75 off a thousand dollars online. And then they got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2023" target="_blank">00:33:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">two 50 off $2,000 on gas, grocery, and dining over three usable, each of three months, 40 off 400 in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2031" target="_blank">00:33:51.820</a></span> | <span class="t">utility and 10% back on at least a hundred dollars a month on travel for two months. I'm not going to break</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2038" target="_blank">00:33:58.940</a></span> | <span class="t">them all down. The short version is on $12,200 to spend, they would have gotten $1,395 back,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2045" target="_blank">00:34:05.740</a></span> | <span class="t">which is 11 and a half percent plus their regular earnings. So let's call it 12 and a half percent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2051" target="_blank">00:34:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So in both these examples, 12 and a half to 15% back on, you know, five to $12,000 in a quarter,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2057" target="_blank">00:34:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">not bad.

I'd encourage you to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2078" target="_blank">00:34:38.780</a></span> | <span class="t">search online and do some research. But if a card could convince, conceivably offer you like a signup</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2084" target="_blank">00:34:44.460</a></span> | <span class="t">bonus every three or four months consistently on an ongoing basis based on your spending.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2090" target="_blank">00:34:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And you know, you're not gonna have to open up a new card for it. Yes, it doesn't have a huge signup</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2095" target="_blank">00:34:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">bonus, but maybe it's earned a spot in your wallet.

I didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2121" target="_blank">00:35:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">include cards that cities discontinued the prestige card, the rewards plus and the AT&T access more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2125" target="_blank">00:35:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's a bunch of retailer cards, like I mentioned, and then three city cards that they actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2130" target="_blank">00:35:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">put at the top of their list.

Like I mentioned earlier, you do need the city premier or the prestige card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2662" target="_blank">00:44:22.060</a></span> | <span class="t">historical card to transfer points to airlines. But when you do, there's a lot of great options.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2666" target="_blank">00:44:26.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And so on the airline side, I said, there's 18. The biggest one I'll highlight is Eva air,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2671" target="_blank">00:44:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">which is an airline based in Taiwan. And they make a ton of award availability,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2676" target="_blank">00:44:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">especially in premium cabins available to their members. So having access to Eva air availability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2682" target="_blank">00:44:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">is a really great way to unlock low cost international business with good availability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2688" target="_blank">00:44:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">to Asia. And while Capital One is the only other transfer partner that has Eva air, Capital One,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2695" target="_blank">00:44:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">you need five Capital One points to get four Eva air points. So it's 1.25 to one. And with city,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2701" target="_blank">00:45:01.820</a></span> | <span class="t">you get one to one. So Eva air is a real standout if you have other points ecosystems to pull from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2707" target="_blank">00:45:07.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you don't, and you're just looking broadly at what is city have, they've got almost all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2714" target="_blank">00:45:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">obvious airlines, they've got flying blue with Air France and KLM, they've got Avianca, Cathay Pacific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2720" target="_blank">00:45:20.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Asia miles, Qantas, Singapore, Turkish Virgin, and a few others. Notably, they don't have any US airlines except</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2728" target="_blank">00:45:28.380</a></span> | <span class="t">jet blue. Now, for me, that doesn't matter, because I know I can use Avianca to book Star</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2734" target="_blank">00:45:34.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Alliance United, I can use flying blue to book Delta, though, I'm often not using points for Delta. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2740" target="_blank">00:45:40.860</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a little bit of a harder game. I will say if you're trying to use your points to book a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2745" target="_blank">00:45:45.020</a></span> | <span class="t">one world flights on American, it's going to be a little trickier, you know, you could use Qantas,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2749" target="_blank">00:45:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">this, but it's hard. And by the way, if you go to all the hacks.com slash TP, you can or in the show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2754" target="_blank">00:45:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">notes, there's a spreadsheet I put together of all the different transfer partners, I kind of try to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2758" target="_blank">00:45:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">highlight and compare them against all of the different programs. And so on the on the airline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2764" target="_blank">00:46:04.540</a></span> | <span class="t">side, the really standout one is is Eva air, there is also Thai air, which only city is a partner of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2770" target="_blank">00:46:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">two things.

And two, I haven't found a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2775" target="_blank">00:46:15.980</a></span> | <span class="t">single redemption worth using Thai airways for. So cool that they have a unique partner, but not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2781" target="_blank">00:46:21.740</a></span> | <span class="t">really cool, because it's not useful. On the hotel side is where I think city really shines. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2786" target="_blank">00:46:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">honestly, the reason that I wanted to get into cities program was hotels and and the Eva air availability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2792" target="_blank">00:46:32.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Notably, city gets choice choice hotels, which is also part of Amex also part of cap one, but you get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2799" target="_blank">00:46:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">a one to two ratio instead of on those programs, you get a one to one. So twice as many choice points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2805" target="_blank">00:46:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Wells Fargo rewards similarly has a one to two choice points.

Choice hotels, the access to some preferred hotels, which are some nice luxury</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2818" target="_blank">00:46:58.460</a></span> | <span class="t">hotels is interesting. There are also a ton of choice hotels, they don't have the most luxurious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2823" target="_blank">00:47:03.820</a></span> | <span class="t">portfolio, there are some really nice Radisson blues, Cambria's ascends. But for the most part,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2829" target="_blank">00:47:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say compared to other hotel chains, this the shining star of choice is not hotels, if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2834" target="_blank">00:47:14.300</a></span> | <span class="t">looking to stay in really luxury properties. But if you are city also has preferred hotels and leading</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2840" target="_blank">00:47:20.300</a></span> | <span class="t">hotels of the world. And those two transfer rate partners are unique to city, no one else has them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2845" target="_blank">00:47:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">which is really exciting. And so the ability to book hotels and luxury hotels is really nice. They also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2851" target="_blank">00:47:31.900</a></span> | <span class="t">have Wyndham and Accor. And so the best hotel bookings here to get the most value out of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2856" target="_blank">00:47:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">city points. If you book preferred hotels, either through preferred hotels or by transferring to choice,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2862" target="_blank">00:47:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">you can get a really good value like up to 0.71 cent per point on choice, which going one to two means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2871" target="_blank">00:47:51.020</a></span> | <span class="t">1.4 to 2 cents of value for transfers to choice. So if your city points are getting 1.4 to 2 cents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2877" target="_blank">00:47:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">that's really good value. On Vacasa, booking through Wyndham, you can get up to about 1.6 cents of value</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2885" target="_blank">00:48:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">from your city points. And for people not familiar, the way Vacasa works is Vacasa is a vacation rental</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2892" target="_blank">00:48:12.700</a></span> | <span class="t">platform. They have tons of properties all over the world. And it's 15,000 Wyndham points to book a Vacasa</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2902" target="_blank">00:48:22.220</a></span> | <span class="t">per bedroom up to places that charge $250 per bedroom. So if you're looking at a three bedroom place,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2909" target="_blank">00:48:29.580</a></span> | <span class="t">if it's $750 a night or less, you can book it for 15,000 points per bedroom per night. And if it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2917" target="_blank">00:48:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">$500 per bedroom per night or less, you can book it for 30,000 points. Let's say a two bedroom that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2923" target="_blank">00:48:43.260</a></span> | <span class="t">under $1,000 a night, you could book for 30,000 points per bedroom per night or 60,000 points a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2928" target="_blank">00:48:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">night. A little complicated. I'll leave a link in the show notes to Wyndham Vacasa bookings,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2932" target="_blank">00:48:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">but good way to get value out of city points. Wyndham is also a transfer partner of Capital One,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2937" target="_blank">00:48:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">so a good way to get value out of Capital One points. And then for leading hotels,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2941" target="_blank">00:49:01.900</a></span> | <span class="t">those points are worth about eight cents each. The transfer ratio is five city points to one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2947" target="_blank">00:49:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">leaders club point. So you end up getting about 1.6 cents. A lot of the perks you get from hotel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2952" target="_blank">00:49:12.460</a></span> | <span class="t">programs booked through travel agencies like fine hotels and resorts or the all the hacks hotel upgrade</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2957" target="_blank">00:49:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">program, you get upgrade breakfast, early, late check-in and check-out. When it comes to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2962" target="_blank">00:49:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">transferring to partners, city does have a lot of transfer bonuses. I looked in 2023 and 2024,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2970" target="_blank">00:49:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">there were 13 and 15 each. So far we've had three in 2025. For the most part, it looks like every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2978" target="_blank">00:49:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">year there's been one Cathay Pacific, Air France, Virgin Atlantic, Accor and Wyndham transfer bonus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2985" target="_blank">00:49:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">at least over the last two years. Last year, there was also a Turkish leading hotels and Etihad</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2990" target="_blank">00:49:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">transfer bonus. And for the most part, all the transfer bonuses end up being 20 to 35%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=2997" target="_blank">00:49:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Anytime they've done a core, it's been a 50% bonus. And anytime they've done Cathay Pacific,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3001" target="_blank">00:50:01.740</a></span> | <span class="t">it's 10 to 15%. But all the rest of them are pretty much between 20 and 35%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3005" target="_blank">00:50:05.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are opportunities to take your points even further by waiting for windows in which you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3010" target="_blank">00:50:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">transfer bonuses. I think as of recording right now, there is a transfer bonus to Virgin Atlantic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3016" target="_blank">00:50:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">for a 30% bonus until May 17th. So I think you're going to get the most value out of thank you points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3023" target="_blank">00:50:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">transferring to airlines, as is true for all points and miles. But notably, unlike a lot of other programs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3029" target="_blank">00:50:29.740</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a lot of opportunity for hotels here, especially choice to book preferred preferred</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3034" target="_blank">00:50:34.300</a></span> | <span class="t">to book preferred and leading hotels for luxury hotels that you don't get in any other program,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3039" target="_blank">00:50:39.020</a></span> | <span class="t">at least at those ratios. Finally, one last great thing about Citi is that you can transfer points to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3044" target="_blank">00:50:44.460</a></span> | <span class="t">anyone else. However, when you transfer points, there is a limit, you can only transfer up to 100,000 points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3050" target="_blank">00:50:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">someone can only receive 100,000 points, and those points expire after 90 days. But if you wanted to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3057" target="_blank">00:50:57.100</a></span> | <span class="t">combine points and book one vacation out of one person's account, or one person has earned status,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3062" target="_blank">00:51:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">you could add 100,000 points from your account and they can transfer them to their transfer partners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3067" target="_blank">00:51:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And that give you a little bit easier ability to do that.

So that's Citi thank you points. Let me talk about at a high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3143" target="_blank">00:52:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">level, what I think is the summary of Citi. What is exciting about Citi? The most exciting few things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3149" target="_blank">00:52:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">are, look, if you care about American status or lounge access, Citi is really the only place to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3154" target="_blank">00:52:34.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if you want to diversify beyond Chase and Amex, there's a lot of interesting reasons to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3160" target="_blank">00:52:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I mentioned, Eva Air, one to one ratio is the only place you can get it. Turkish has some good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3166" target="_blank">00:52:46.940</a></span> | <span class="t">sweet spots, not as many as they used to. Turkish is not on Chase and Amex. And then Cathay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3172" target="_blank">00:52:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Qantas and Etihad are all not on Chase as well. So you get some new options on the hotels front,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3178" target="_blank">00:52:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">you get choice at one to two leading hotels in the world and preferred, which are also not Chase and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3182" target="_blank">00:53:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Amex. So a lot of good options, at least choice at that transfer ratio is not, but a lot of good hotel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3187" target="_blank">00:53:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">options. On the earning side, I was really surprised to see what I'm going to share. So I used the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3195" target="_blank">00:53:15.820</a></span> | <span class="t">credit card optimizer tool I built, and there's a link to it on the website. And I went in and I used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3201" target="_blank">00:53:21.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Bureau of Labor Statistics standard earning data for a household earning, I think, over $100,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3207" target="_blank">00:53:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And just said, what if people had the best two card combo from all major issuers? What would their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3215" target="_blank">00:53:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">average points earning ratio be? So worst in the pack is actually Chase. So that's primarily because the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3224" target="_blank">00:53:44.700</a></span> | <span class="t">best everything else card is the Freedom Unlimited, which only earns one and a half points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3229" target="_blank">00:53:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so with Chase, the best combo would be the Chase Sapphire Reserve and the Freedom Unlimited,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3234" target="_blank">00:53:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">you'd get 3x travel dining, one and a half x everything else for a total annual fees of $550.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3240" target="_blank">00:54:00.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But the average earning there is 1.91x points. So you're not even getting an average of 2x points, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3247" target="_blank">00:54:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously, if you're doing City getting your second card as the double cash, the floor is 2x points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3253" target="_blank">00:54:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So not great.

Obviously, your own spending affects this. If you want to go use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3263" target="_blank">00:54:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the tool I built, you can put in your own spending and see. But Chase is really low in the pack. Worst</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3270" target="_blank">00:54:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">worst here when it comes to a two card combo. Next is Amex. I guess the best Amex two card combo,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3278" target="_blank">00:54:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're not talking business cards, would be the Amex Gold and the Amex Green. You'd get travel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3285" target="_blank">00:54:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">transit, dining, and groceries. And you'd get a $400 of annual fees. And your earning average rate would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3294" target="_blank">00:54:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">1.96. Now, if you replace the Amex Green with the Blue Business Plus, which earns 2x points on up to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3300" target="_blank">00:55:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">$50,000 a year with no annual fee, you'd have a much higher earning rate of 2.37. But again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3306" target="_blank">00:55:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that's using the BLS data. If I use my own spending, which that everything else category goes over $50,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3313" target="_blank">00:55:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a year, it really starts to weigh that average down because then you're earning 1x on everything else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3319" target="_blank">00:55:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Amex is really a bad platform for the everything else category because they don't have a card that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3325" target="_blank">00:55:25.100</a></span> | <span class="t">earns 1.5x unlimited or 2x unlimited on the everything category.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3329" target="_blank">00:55:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So then you come to the three real contenders for a two card combo in one ecosystem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3335" target="_blank">00:55:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You've got Capital One with the Venture Card and the Saver Card. So $95 of annual fees,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3342" target="_blank">00:55:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">2.26 earning on everything. With the Saver, you get 3x dining, groceries, streaming, and entertainment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3351" target="_blank">00:55:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And you've got very similar transfer partners actually to Citi. So Citi has a better, you get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3357" target="_blank">00:55:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">JetBlue, you get EVA 1 to 1, you get Choice at 1 to 2 instead of 1 to 1 and some other hotel stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3364" target="_blank">00:56:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then Capital One has Tap Portugal, which is a pretty matte airline to redeem points on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3368" target="_blank">00:56:08.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'd say comparing these two, Citi's at the top of the pack, 2.33x with the Strata Premier and the Double Cash.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3377" target="_blank">00:56:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Just to recap, Strata Premier is getting 3x on dining, gas, grocery, hotels, and flights on a $95 annual fee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3384" target="_blank">00:56:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So 2.33x on everything. Now, the other card that's really close behind, and when I say really close,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3389" target="_blank">00:56:29.980</a></span> | <span class="t">the Citi average for a two card combo was 2.33x and the Wells Fargo average was 2.32x.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3396" target="_blank">00:56:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So 0.01% less in terms of points. And that is the Wells Fargo autograph card paired with the Wells Fargo</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3405" target="_blank">00:56:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">active cash card. Now, it has $0 annual fee. So maybe you could say that takes the cake.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3410" target="_blank">00:56:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And the autograph card is doing 3x on dining, travel, transit, gas, streaming, and cell phones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3416" target="_blank">00:56:56.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So pretty compelling alternative to the Citi Premier card. What you miss there is you don't get the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3423" target="_blank">00:57:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">grocery spend. But the thing I don't love about Wells Fargo is they have a much, much more limited</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3428" target="_blank">00:57:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">set of transfer partners. They've only got five airlines that you can transfer to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3432" target="_blank">00:57:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And on the hotel front, they only have one hotel program. So they do have choice at one to two,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3439" target="_blank">00:57:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which is nice, but that's it. So you're just really, really limited with Wells Fargo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3443" target="_blank">00:57:23.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think everyone thought when Wells Fargo launched all these transfer partners,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3446" target="_blank">00:57:26.780</a></span> | <span class="t">that there would be a ton of options that were getting added and added month and month after month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3451" target="_blank">00:57:31.460</a></span> | <span class="t">But unfortunately, it turns out they were not added month and month after month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3454" target="_blank">00:57:34.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And they really haven't added a ton of transfer partners. So I think Wells Fargo is an interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3459" target="_blank">00:57:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">earning rate. The cards are compelling, but I think the program just isn't where the Citi program is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3464" target="_blank">00:57:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So at the end of the day, if you want a two card combo and you want it from one issuer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3468" target="_blank">00:57:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the Citi Premier and the double cash from an earning standpoint is the best option out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3473" target="_blank">00:57:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I went in and replaced the BLS spending with my spending data and it was still the best card out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3478" target="_blank">00:57:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">there compared to all the others.

They also don't have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3523" target="_blank">00:58:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">refer a friend program. They also don't have points that you get from a shopping portal. So that's hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3528" target="_blank">00:58:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and they have lower limits.

Hopefully, I can get that up over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3539" target="_blank">00:58:59.480</a></span> | <span class="t">time.

And it's really interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3595" target="_blank">00:59:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I look at the offers, they're not as compelling as what you get with Chase and Amex,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3599" target="_blank">00:59:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">but there were some that I thought are worth mentioning. You know, they had an offer for Lyft,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3603" target="_blank">01:00:03.580</a></span> | <span class="t">$5 off $25 spend, $25 off $250 of JetBlue, $50 off $150 at Trust & Will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3612" target="_blank">01:00:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">An interesting one was 4% back at Giant, the grocery store. We don't have them in the Bay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3616" target="_blank">01:00:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Area, but you could do it up to 10 times for up to $30. But some of them are really, really tiny</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3622" target="_blank">01:00:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">offers. So Walmart, 4% back up to $3. I saw one for 8% back on my FICO. I was kind of disappointed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3631" target="_blank">01:00:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">because I paid for that and I didn't use an offer. I don't think I had gotten the card yet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3635" target="_blank">01:00:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">but still. And then last, there was one for Dropbox, 20% off $100 plus purchase at Dropbox,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3641" target="_blank">01:00:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which I will likely use because I think my Dropbox plan renews.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3644" target="_blank">01:00:44.900</a></span> | <span class="t">They did have a bunch of local restaurants, like five to 10, five or six restaurants that we actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3650" target="_blank">01:00:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">go to that are local where we live in our Bay Area suburb in town. Most of them were all offering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3655" target="_blank">01:00:55.900</a></span> | <span class="t">6% back. Obviously, they're probably partnered with some other platform to do this because I just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3660" target="_blank">01:01:00.700</a></span> | <span class="t">don't think that Citi is making deals with all these small restaurants. But at the end of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3665" target="_blank">01:01:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">day, there's 315 offers on my account. And almost all of them except the ones I mentioned are pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3671" target="_blank">01:01:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">low 1% to 10% back with caps. None of the massive crazy offers that I've seen with Citi and Amex lately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3678" target="_blank">01:01:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So good that they have them. Good to get them all added. Good to know where they are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3684" target="_blank">01:01:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">but probably not going to add a huge amount of earning. So that's my end. I'm really excited to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3690" target="_blank">01:01:30.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in the Citi ecosystem. I'm excited to do this episode because I think there's a lot of opportunity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3694" target="_blank">01:01:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">here. Even if you want to just go cash back, the combo of Citi Strata Premier and Double Cash,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3699" target="_blank">01:01:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">using those for cash back is a pretty compelling option as well. So if you like this, if you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3704" target="_blank">01:01:44.860</a></span> | <span class="t">like this, would love feedback.

Expect another one of these on each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3712" target="_blank">01:01:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">program. I'm probably going to focus on the ones first that are less well-known. Things like Bank of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3718" target="_blank">01:01:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">America and Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank that we haven't dove into as much, though most of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3723" target="_blank">01:02:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">exciting U.S. Bank cards are no longer available or have been knocked down a bit. So maybe we'll skip</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3728" target="_blank">01:02:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that. And then I'm going to do everything I can to try to put the Chase and Amex one out on the main</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3733" target="_blank">01:02:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">feed. But I think realistically, it's going to be tough. So if you want those, definitely check out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-gcLezBj8&t=3738" target="_blank">01:02:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the member site, allthehacks.com slash join.
