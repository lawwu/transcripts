What if solving one problem could unlock solutions to thousands more? The immortal Ziggswang The strange castle Lisa Dolls move 78 and There we go Alpha goes move 37 All moments and games played by AI systems That marked the milestone in the history of artificial intelligence Started with board games went on to protein folding And maybe all solves the rest of this puzzle after all with the same kind of ideas or the same kind of methods Life after all folks is just a game Thank you, Deep Mind. This was a fun visit fun a couple of conversations Thank you for the work you do Thank you for the work you do.</p></div></body></html>
