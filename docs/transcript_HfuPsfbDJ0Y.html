But in order to take advantage of that healthcare, a significant number of people, mostly at the bottom of the pyramid or toward the middle of the pyramid economically, can't afford it.</p><p>We've priced ourselves out of the market. So we don't universally have great healthcare. We're like everywhere else. What people really don't know is that healthcare is as good or better overseas, cross borders, than they can get here in the United States. And the conception there is anyone who hasn't traveled overseas can't imagine a Four Seasons or a Hilton or a Denny's or a J.Crew or a Costco.</p><p>All of those exist in almost every city in the world now. And yet people who can't conceptualize that, who can't get their arms around that, are not going to be able to get their arms around being on an operating table or a dental treatment chair in a mind-blowingly advanced hygienic environment.</p><p>They just can't see that happening. What they see is a mud hut, rusty scalpels, and weird doctors that don't know English.</p></div></div></body></html>
