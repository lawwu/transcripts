A song, a psalm of the sons of Korah. Great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God his holy mountain. Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth is Mount Zion in the far north, the city of the great king. God in her palaces has made himself known as a stronghold.</p><p>For behold, the kings assembled themselves, they passed by together, they saw it, then they were astonished. They were dismayed, they fled in alarm, panic seized them there, anguish as of a woman in childbirth. With the east wind you break the ships of Tarshish. As we have heard, so we have seen.</p><p>In the city of Yahweh of hosts, in the city of our God, God will establish her forever. Selah. We have thought in your loving kindness, O God, in the midst of your temple. As is your name, O God, so is your praise to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is full of righteousness.</p><p>Let Mount Zion be glad, let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments. Walk about Zion, and go around her, count her towers, consider her ramparts, go through her palaces, that you may recount it to the next generation. For this is God, our God for ever and ever.</p><p>He will guide us over death. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p></div></div></body></html>
