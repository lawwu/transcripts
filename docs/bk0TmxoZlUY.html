I'm a solutions engineer at BrainTrust. As you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=22" target="_blank">00:00:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">see here, we're an end-to-end developer platform for building AI products. We do evals. If you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=28" target="_blank">00:00:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">watched the keynote this morning, you saw our founding engineer jumping up and down on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">stage yelling evals. I am not going to do that. I'm not as funny or cool as him, but we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">should all be very excited about evals here. Very brief agenda of what we'll cover today</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.460</a></span> | <span class="t">in this sort of intro. Very, very brief company overview. Give you an intro to evals. Why would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you even start thinking about using them? What are they? What are the different components</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">that you need to create an eval? Some more BrainTrust specific things via running evals via our SDK.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You'll see in the examples that you can run evals both in the platform itself as well as the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">SDK. I think it's a really kind of cool thing that we can connect maybe the local development</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that we're doing with what we're doing within the platform. And then how we then move to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">production. This is maybe human review. This is online scoring. So how well is our application</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">performing in production? And then lastly, a little bit of human in the loop. Getting user</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">feedback from your users. How do we now take some of these production logs and feed them into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the data sets that we're using in our evals. Creating this really great flywheel effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. Quick, quick company overview. You see up there maybe in the top right some of our fund,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.780</a></span> | <span class="t">excuse me, some of our investors. Maybe a quick call out on the leadership side. Ankur Goyal is our CEO.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe the reason to call out that is Ankur in the last two stops, he essentially built BrainTrust from scratch the last two places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is really where he found the idea to like maybe this is actually a thing that people need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And really the origination story of BrainTrust. The other thing to call out here is like we already have a lot of companies using BrainTrust in production today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">This is just a few of the companies that are utilizing us for evals, for observability of their Gen AI applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I won't bore you too much with that, but let's jump into this. If you're at the keynote, you probably saw a similar slide here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't take it out, but you see like the tech luminaries here, I think as Manu referenced them, talking about evals and the importance of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this is a, you know, obviously this is an intro to evals track. And what better way to start this out with some really, you know, influential people in the space talking about evals and why they are so important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So why would you think about evals, right? They, they, they help you answer questions. So here's, here's a few of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">When I change the underlying model to my application, is it, is it getting better or is it getting worse?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">When I change my prompt, right? When I change certain, certain things about the application, is it getting better or is it getting worse?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to get away from not having a rigorous sort of process around building with large language models, which as you all know, right, non-deterministic outputs creates somewhat of a challenge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And without evals in place, it becomes really, really hard to, to create a good application that we can put into production.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe some other ones, like obviously being able to detect regressions within the, within the code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the other, the other thing that Ankur mentioned to me when I first started, which I didn't really mention this, but this is my, my third week at, at BrainTrust as a solutions engineer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of the things that he mentioned to me that I thought really resonated was, uh, evals are a really great way, I think people think of them as almost like unit tests for, uh, for our, you know, our applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But he kind of described it in another way of like, this is a really great way for us to play offense, uh, as opposed to just playing defense, where I think maybe unit tests are, are kind of used for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This can actually be used as a tool to, to really help, uh, create a lot of rigor around us building and developing these applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And ensuring that we actually build, uh, things that we can put into production.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe from like a business perspective, uh, why would you think about running evals or using evals?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, here's a few here, uh, if you have, um, evals running both offline and online, you create this feedback loop or this flywheel effect that I think Manu mentioned in the, in the keynote, in the keynote, excuse me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and this flywheel effect allows us to, you know, uh, cut dev time, allows us to, uh, enhance the quality of this application that we're putting out in production.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're able to connect the things that are happening in, in real life with your users in production and being able to, uh, filter those logs down, add those spans to data sets, inform what you're doing in an offline way creates, uh, that, that flywheel effect that becomes really powerful from a development perspective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, again, a little bit more on the, on the customer side, here's a few of our customers and some of the outcomes that they've, that they've seen using brain trust, whether it's, uh, moving a little bit faster, pushing more AI features into production or just increasing the quality of, of the applications that they have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's, let's, let's start talking a little bit about the, the core concepts of, of, of brain trust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously we're here to talk about evals, uh, the, the, the things that I think, um, you see like these arrow, these arrows going, uh, one way and the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.760</a></span> | <span class="t">This again is that, that flywheel effect that, that I described earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, there's the, the prompt engineering aspect of this, uh, in brain trust, think of, uh, this playground that we have as an IDE for LLM outputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, the playgrounds allow for that rapid prototyping as we make those changes, as we change the underlying model, what is the impact to that, to that, uh, particular, uh, task or that application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Then those evals allow us to understand the improvement or the regression of those changes and then the observability aspect, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the, the logs that we're generating in production, the, the ability to, uh, uh, uh, have a human review those logs in a really easy, uh, intuitive interface and then have user feedback from actual users be logged into the application as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So what is an eval?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, you probably, uh, heard this, uh, several times today throughout the week if you stopped by the booth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But sort of our definition here is that structured test that checks how well your AI system performs, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It helps you measure these things that are important, quality, reliability, uh, correctness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So what are the ingredients in an eval, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been talking a little bit about task, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the thing, uh, the code or the prompt that we want to, uh, evaluate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The, the really cool thing about brain trust is that this can be as simple as a, as a sim, excuse me, a single prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or it could be this, this full sort of agentic workflow where we're, uh, calling out the tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no sort of limit on to the, uh, the, the complexity that we put into this task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The only thing it requires is an input and an output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The second thing is a data set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">This is our, uh, real world examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">This is, uh, essentially what we're gonna run the task against to understand how well, uh, our application is performing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And how we do that is via scores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the score is really the, the logic behind your evals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.840</a></span> | <span class="t">There's, there's a couple different ways to think about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">There's the LLM as a judge type score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, uh, you give it the, the output and some criteria and it is able to assess, uh, like say, I want, uh, based on this output, is this excellent?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this fair, is this poor?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then those outputs then correspond to, you know, 0.5 or 1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, you also have code based scores, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">These are maybe a little bit more heuristic or binary, but, uh, we can use both of these to really aid in the development of that, of that eval and ensuring that we're building a really good application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, I think I just sort of mentioned this here as well, but like the, the two mental models here of, of evals, there's, there's offline and online.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=520"

target="_blank">00:08:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">This is us actually doing that, that iteration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It's, uh, identifying and resolving issues before deployment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, this is where we're defining those tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It's where we're defining those scores, uh, online evals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">This is that real time tracing of, of, of the application in production.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's logging the model inputs and the outputs, uh, the intermediate steps, the tool calls, everything that's happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It allows us to diagnose performance and reliability issues, latency, uh, based on how you instrument your, your application with brain trust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.760</a></span> | <span class="t">We can pull back lots of different metrics related to cost and tokens and duration and all of these things help inform, uh, how we build this application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I'll, I'll jump into a little bit more of like how we can instrument our app, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">for online evals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, we're going to first, I think, talk a little bit more of the offline before doing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, maybe just like level set on how to improve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one of the, the, the, the things that I've seen, uh, in the last few days here, the conversations that I've had, it's like almost, how do I get started?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Or what do I do if X or, you know, those types of questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing I heard from Anker, uh, very early on is that like, just get started, create that baseline that you can then iterate and build from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, I think a lot of people get caught in like creating this, this golden data set of test cases, uh, that they, they can then like iterate from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, start, you, you don't necessarily have to do that, start and build that, uh, that baseline, establish that foundation that you can then improve upon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is a really good sort of matrix of like, uh, if I have good output, but a low score, what do I do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. Improve your evals. If I have bad output and a high score, improve your, your evals or your scoring, but really good kind of like high level, uh, understanding of, of where to start to target your, your efforts when you are building these apps and you're in, you're creating evals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's jump into the actual components that I just, that I just talked about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So within the brain trust platform, we have a task, uh, again, this could be a prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">This could be like this full agentic workflow, uh, very basic, you, you see that, that gif running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a prompt within the platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You specify an underlying model that you wanted to use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You give it a, a system prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can also, uh, give it access to tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It has access to mustache, mustache templating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can pass in variables like user questions or, um, you know, the input from the user, its chat history or metadata, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we actually go and want to parse through these logs, the metadata becomes actually beneficial.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, enabling us to do that in a really easy way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, going forward, uh, maybe we have a multi-turn sort of chat type scenario where we want to add</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.520</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, additional messages for the system and the assistant and the user, uh, and our tool calls as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, the, uh, the, the platform allows for that just via this, uh, plus this messages, uh, button.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you're able to add those different messages to the prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, also we can add tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So oftentimes the, the, the prompt will, will need access to, to something, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe it's a, a rag type workflow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe it's doing web search, whatever it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">We can now use those tools as part of that prompt, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when you use sort of encode in that prompt, like make sure you use X tool, uh, this prompt has access</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to that tool while it's running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, the last one, this is actually a feature that is in beta right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, it's actually creating more of that agentic type workflow within your, uh, within the brain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">trust platform itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's, it's a way right now, at least to chain together prompts where the, the output of one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">now becomes the input of the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you think back maybe to, to this slide, if I have sort of, um, this prompt that has access</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to tools, you, you create a pretty powerful system here where you're able to go from, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe that first step that has X access to a certain tool and we get some output from that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We can then go to that next step that has access to maybe some other tools, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That's sort of like maybe multi-agent type of workflow we can create with the underlying tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">within those prompts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The second thing that I talked about is data sets, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">These are our test cases that we want to give to the, the task to run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can sort of iterate over that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">We can get the output and then going down a little bit further, actually score that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is, um, obviously really important when we're, when we're running our evals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when we are, uh, trying to pull from production, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The, the actual logs that are happening, we can add those, those, uh, spans, those traces</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to the data sets in a really easy way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And I can show you what that looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, uh, if you look there at the bottom, the only thing that's required is the, the input.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, you also have the ability to add, uh, expected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So what is the expected output for that input, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You can sort of like, uh, create some sort of score that looks at the output with the expected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a, a score called Levenstein that allows you to, you know, measure the, the, the difference</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">between those two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can do some different things based on what you provide to that data set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You also have metadata as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, being able to filter down different things, pulling the data set maybe into your own code base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want to filter by again, X, Y, or Z via the metadata.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">That's all possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, I mentioned this a little bit ago, but just start small and iterate, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't have to create this golden data set to, to get started here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, just, just start and then, uh, then continue to iterate and build from that baseline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, the human review portion also becomes really powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, when we have stuff, uh, being logged within production, having humans actually go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">through those logs and, you know, there's lots of different ways to filter it down to the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that they should be looking at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we can now decide to add those things to certain data sets that then inform, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the offline evals that we're running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, the last thing, the last ingredient here that we need for our, excuse me, uh, for our evals are our scores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">We have both code base scores, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=883"

the bottom left, or you can within your own code base,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">create that score and then push it into brain trust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can use it in the platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Other users who are maybe aren't in the code base can use that score as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The other score that we have access to is called LLM as a judge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So this allows us to use an LLM to sort of judge the output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We can give it the, the set of criteria that indicates what a good or a fair or a bad score,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">or whatever it is, you, you get to decide, uh, what that looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So you give it that criteria and it says, if it's good, uh, I want to do a one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.120</a></span> | <span class="t">If it's bad, I want to do a

scores, uh, that we can use in that offline, in that online sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing to call out here is that we have, um, internally built a package called auto evals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is something that you can now pull into your project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">These are out of the box scores that are both LLM as a judge, as well as code base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it just allows you to get started very, very quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Another thing I heard Ankur mention is, um, maybe starting with Levenstein,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.840</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe not the best score in a lot of cases, but again, it establishes a baseline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Very, very little development work for, for, uh, our users,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but it creates that thing that we can then build from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And now you have, uh, a direction, a direction to go in to go build maybe that more custom score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of the things that we've heard from our customers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">some tips that, um, that, you know, important to think about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of our customers are using higher quality models for scoring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, even if the prompt uses a cheaper model, just, just makes a lot of sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like while we're running that application to use the cheaper model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">but use the, the more expensive one to actually go out and score it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, also break your scoring into, uh, very focused areas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So, uh, the example that I'll show is a, an application that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that generates a change log from a series of commits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So I could create a score that says assess my accuracy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">my formatting, and my correctness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Or I could create three different scores that assess accuracy and then formatting and then correctness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So have your scores be very targeted to the thing, uh, that they're supposed to be doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, test your score pump, excuse me, prompts in the playground before use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then avoid, avoid overloading the score or prompt with context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, focus it on the relevant input and the output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, couple things here, here's where, uh, over on the left we have our playgrounds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">This is where we do that, that sort of like rapid iteration where we can pull in those prompts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">We can pull in those agents, add our data sets and add our scores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can click run and it'll go out and sort of churn through that data set that we've defined.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And it will give you a sense for how well your task is performing against the data set with the scores that we define.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is the place where, uh, developers, uh, PMs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">We even have a healthcare company that has doctors coming into the platform and interacting with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">playground and even doing human review as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, depends a little bit obviously on, on the organization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The thing on the right is our experiments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1072" target="_blank">00:17:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">This is our sort of like snapshot in time of those evals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So imagine now like as we are doing this development and we're trying to understand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, like the last, you know, the last month or so, are, are we getting better, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">The, the, the changes that we are making, the model changes, whatever it is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">are we improving our, our application and the experiments is a really great way to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to understand that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, really important maybe to call out as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see in the bottom, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The evals can happen from, uh, the application, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The, the brain trust platform as well as via the SDK.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1106" target="_blank">00:18:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe just really quick because, uh, nobody likes looking at, at slides all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I, I certainly don't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, maybe if you haven't seen brain trust yet, this is maybe a good, a good quick demo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1117" target="_blank">00:18:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, so again, like the, the, uh, the idea here is I have this, this application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll just give you, I'll show you over here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, you give it a GitHub repository URL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It, uh, grabs the most recent commits and then creates a change log from there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1132" target="_blank">00:18:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then once this completes, you can even provide some user feedback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1135" target="_blank">00:18:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is the thing that we want to, uh, evaluate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I can do, uh, I'll go into my, my playground, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the place where I can start to, uh, run those, those, uh, those experiments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Or I can start to iterate on that prompt that I have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1149" target="_blank">00:19:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">From my project, I've actually loaded in two different, uh, two different prompts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1155" target="_blank">00:19:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe I'll, before going into the playground, I've actually created these two prompts within</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">my code base and I pushed them into the brain trust platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I've also created a dataset in that code base and I've also created some scores, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">These are the ingredients that we need to run our evals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1171" target="_blank">00:19:31.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So now when we have, we have those, we have those different components.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Now we're able to start to iterate here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1178" target="_blank">00:19:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to actually create a net new playground and I will load in one of these prompts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, here's my first prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, my first prompt has a model associated with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">What becomes really cool here is the ability to, to like, to iterate on the underlying model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I think a lot of us are, we have access to a lot of underlying providers and we want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to be able to understand if I change this or if I, you know, a provider adds a new model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">what is the impact to my application?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1208" target="_blank">00:20:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can duplicate this prompt and maybe change this to GPT 4.1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I can run this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Before I run it, I have to add all of my components.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1221" target="_blank">00:20:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll add my, my dataset and then I can add my different scores that I've, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1225"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1227" target="_blank">00:20:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I can click run and then now we'll understand here, what is the effect of changing the model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1235" target="_blank">00:20:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, for this particular task with the scores that I've configured against this dataset.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So this will churn through all of these in, in parallel and we'll start to get some results back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1243" target="_blank">00:20:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, lots of different ways to actually start to look at this data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1246" target="_blank">00:20:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I always like coming over to the summary layout because I can understand like, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1250" target="_blank">00:20:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">um, you can see over here, this is my base task right here and then my comparison task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1254" target="_blank">00:20:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can understand, uh, looks like, you know, on average, uh, that the base is performing a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1260" target="_blank">00:21:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">bit better than my, uh, comparison task on my completeness score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1264" target="_blank">00:21:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, it's varying a little bit worse on my accuracy score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, both of them are, you know, zero percent on my formatting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So probably have some work to do there, but you can start to see how you can use this type of interface</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1276" target="_blank">00:21:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to iterate very quickly, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1278" target="_blank">00:21:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, uh, the other thing that, um, maybe shouldn't do, but, uh, I can't resist because we just released</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">this today is this new loop feature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1287" target="_blank">00:21:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So imagine you are, uh, you know, you're a user within brain trust and before this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1292" target="_blank">00:21:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you would sort of manually iterate here and creating net new prompts, uh, making modifications,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">changing the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">What if you could now utilize AI to go and do that for you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1302" target="_blank">00:21:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So any sort of like cursor like, uh, interface, we can ask it to optimize a prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the really unique thing here is it has access to those, uh, those evaluation results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1313" target="_blank">00:21:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when it goes to go, uh, change that prompt, it understands that it changes the prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It runs the evaluation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It understands if it got better relative to the scores that we defined.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1323" target="_blank">00:22:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see if it's going to go through here, it'll fetch some eval results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1327" target="_blank">00:22:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, you'll probably see a diff here very, very soon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1330" target="_blank">00:22:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">If we don't, I won't, I won't hang out here too long, but I do want to highlight one of the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1334" target="_blank">00:22:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that we are releasing that really enables our users to iterate in a really, uh, really fast way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1339" target="_blank">00:22:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's my, my change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">We can click accept and then it'll actually go out and run that eval again or it would.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1347" target="_blank">00:22:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, I think I have an issue with my anthropic API keys, but the idea here again is like we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1353" target="_blank">00:22:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">create that very rapid, uh, iterative feedback loop here within the playground.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1357" target="_blank">00:22:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing here is, uh, we can run these as experiments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1361" target="_blank">00:22:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is, um, this is where we can start to create those snapshots in time of that eval.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, see as I make these changes to that, that application, how is it sort of performed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">over time?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to make sure I don't, I don't want to go down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1376" target="_blank">00:22:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't want to like, uh, decrease the performance of my scores relative to obviously the last time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it ran, but, uh, looking out over the last month, six months, whatever it is that we're tracking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was very, very, uh, brief sort of intro to like evals via the UI, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, like just to summarize, we need a task, we need a dataset and we need at least one score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We can pull those into the playground and now we can start to iterate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We can save these via experiments. Uh, and now we can, we have a way in which we can understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">how well this application is performing, right? This is no longer like qualitative, right? This isn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like, Hey, I think this got better. That output looks better. There is actual rigor behind this now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, customers oftentimes ask though, like, I don't really want to use, or I'm not going to use the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the platform as much. I'd rather use this from my, my code base. Is that possible?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, and it is. Uh, so, uh, we have, uh, Python SDK. We have a TypeScript SDK. There, there's some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1439" target="_blank">00:23:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">other ones as well, Go, Java, Kotlin. Uh, for the most part, most of our users are using, uh, Python</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1444" target="_blank">00:24:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">or TypeScript. Here's a, just a couple examples of what this might look like from an SDK perspective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1450" target="_blank">00:24:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, actually, if you all aren't, uh, opposed to looking at, uh, some code, here's just a, a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1457" target="_blank">00:24:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">basic example of, uh, defining a prompt within my, my code base and then pushing it into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1463" target="_blank">00:24:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">brain trust. So just leveraging that, that Python SDK, uh, another example, I should come over here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1469" target="_blank">00:24:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Creating a score. So you give it sort of like the, the things that it's looking for,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1475" target="_blank">00:24:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">but now I've sort of defined this score within my code base. Uh, it's version controlled. Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1480" target="_blank">00:24:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">also the, the prompts that you create within the UI are version controlled as well. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1484" target="_blank">00:24:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but this is just another way to start to interact with, with brain trust. So again, scores, we could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1489" target="_blank">00:24:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">do data sets, uh, and then you can even do, uh, prompts up here as well, I believe. So here's my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1493" target="_blank">00:24:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">eval data set. Here's my, uh, change log to prompt. Again, being able to start from the code base and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1499" target="_blank">00:24:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">actually push them into the platform is possible. Just depends on the organization where they want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">start. The, the other thing here is like, this is more on the, like the, the components of the eval side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's that top portion. Define those assets in code, run that brain trust push, and now you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1514" target="_blank">00:25:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">access to that in that brain trust library. The other one is actually like defining the evals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1518" target="_blank">00:25:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and code, right? So what that looks like is, is slightly different. Um, come over here. So we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">our eval, but this is just a class that's coming from our brain trust SDK. Again, it's looking for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1529" target="_blank">00:25:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">exact same things that I just described, right? A data set that we can use from, uh, brain trust itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1534" target="_blank">00:25:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, the task that we want to invoke and then the scores. So again, defining this here within, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1541" target="_blank">00:25:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">within your code base, certainly possible. And then I can run, you know, a command</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1545" target="_blank">00:25:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that actually runs that eval within brain trust. So from here, go into brain trust, see the eval running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1554" target="_blank">00:25:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">This is now experiment that I can view over time. So again, like you saw two different types of workflows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1560" target="_blank">00:26:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">here, uh, again, catering to maybe two different personas or again, the way in which organizations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1565" target="_blank">00:26:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">want to work, it's up to them. Brain trust is very flexible and how we allow our users to, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1570" target="_blank">00:26:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to consume or use the platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1572" target="_blank">00:26:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, probably jumped ahead a little bit, but this is sort of a recap of what I just showed you. Again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1588" target="_blank">00:26:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">from your code, you, you create your prompts, your scores, your data sets, you can push them in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1592" target="_blank">00:26:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, maybe it's just importantly to important to highlight here of like why you would do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1597" target="_blank">00:26:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, you want to source control your, your prompts. Uh, the big one here to call out is the online</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1602" target="_blank">00:26:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">scoring. Uh, I have a section in a little bit diving a little bit deeper into that. Uh, but if you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1607" target="_blank">00:26:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to use those scores that we define in the dataset, we should push them into brain trust so that we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1612" target="_blank">00:26:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">create online scores. We can understand how our application is performing in production relative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1616" target="_blank">00:26:56.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to those scores that we want or that we're using within our offline evals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1620" target="_blank">00:27:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">What I just showed you, maybe another, uh, another variation of that, that eval within our code. Again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1626" target="_blank">00:27:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">defining that dataset, defining that task, defining those scores becomes very, very easy to now connect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1632" target="_blank">00:27:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">these two things. It's just again, up to you to decide where you are, where you want to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1636" target="_blank">00:27:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing to call out here is that this can be run via CI/CD. We do have some customers that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1641" target="_blank">00:27:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that want to run their evals as part of the CI process. So understanding in a more automated way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1647" target="_blank">00:27:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">right? The, the score for A, B and C, whatever they've configured. Has it gotten better? Has it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1651" target="_blank">00:27:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">gotten worse? This becomes maybe a check as part of CI. There is, uh, if you look within our documentation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1656" target="_blank">00:27:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a, a GitHub action example that shows you how you could set this up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1660" target="_blank">00:27:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool.

But so, so why should you do it? Um, I think I've probably said it, said it numerous times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1691" target="_blank">00:28:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">here, but we want to measure quality on live traffic, right?

The other really important thing to call</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1712" target="_blank">00:28:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">out, I think is that, that flywheel effect that it creates. So we have these data sets that we use to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1718" target="_blank">00:28:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">inform our offline evals. It's very, very easy now to take the, the logs that are generated within</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1724" target="_blank">00:28:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">production and add those back to data sets. This also, um, speaks to some of that human</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1729" target="_blank">00:28:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">review component where we want to now bring those humans in. They can start to review some of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1735" target="_blank">00:28:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">logs that are relevant. Like maybe there's user feedback equals zero. Maybe there's a comment or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1739" target="_blank">00:28:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever it is, but like they can filter down to those particular things. And as they find really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1744" target="_blank">00:29:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting, maybe test cases, it's very, very easy to add those, uh, back to the data set that we use in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1749" target="_blank">00:29:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">our offline evals. So I think the, the feedback loop or the flywheel effect that that's, that this creates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1755" target="_blank">00:29:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is one of the really fundamental value props of, of the platform. So how do we do this? Uh, there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1761" target="_blank">00:29:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a couple different ways, right? We're first going to initialize a logger. This is just going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1765" target="_blank">00:29:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">authenticate us into brain trust and point us to a project. Uh, you may have seen when I opened up the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1770" target="_blank">00:29:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">platform, I had numerous projects inside of there. You can almost think of a project as a, as a container for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1776" target="_blank">00:29:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that feature, right? So you probably have multiple AI features that you're building. I want to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1781" target="_blank">00:29:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the container for feature A for those prompts, those scores, those data sets. You could certainly utilize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1786" target="_blank">00:29:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">those things across projects, but it becomes a really good sort of way to, uh, containerize the things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1791" target="_blank">00:29:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">are important for that feature. Then you can start really basic, right? You can wrap a, uh, an LLM client.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1797" target="_blank">00:29:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, so when you saw those, some of those metrics with like tokens and LLM duration and costs, uh, just very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1805" target="_blank">00:30:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">basically within the, the, uh, the script or excuse me, the, the code here, I just wrapped that open AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1810" target="_blank">00:30:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">client. And now I'm just sort of ingesting all of that, those metrics into my logs. That's the easiest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1816" target="_blank">00:30:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">way to get started. You obviously probably want to do a little bit more again. Maybe you want to, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1821" target="_blank">00:30:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">understand when, you know, that LLM invokes a tool. So I want to trace, uh, I can add a trace decorator</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1828" target="_blank">00:30:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">on top of a function. Uh, I can even use some of the, like the, the brain trust low level, like span elements</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1835" target="_blank">00:30:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to create custom logs. And I want to customize the input and I want to customize the output and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1839" target="_blank">00:30:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the metadata that we, that we log to that span. So again, you can, you can start very basic with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1844" target="_blank">00:30:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">wrapping a client and then go down to like the individual span itself, specifying that input and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1848" target="_blank">00:30:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1849" target="_blank">00:30:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">This leads us to online scoring, right? This is, I talked a little bit about this, right? This is where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1858" target="_blank">00:30:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">like when our logs are coming in, we can actually configure within the platform, those scores that we want to run,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and we can specify sort of a sampling rate. So we don't necessarily run that score across</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1868" target="_blank">00:31:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">every single log that comes in. Maybe it's 10%, 20%, so on. Um, but it, but it creates that really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1874" target="_blank">00:31:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">tight feedback loop that, that I've been talking about. Uh, also maybe just important to mention</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1880" target="_blank">00:31:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the early regression alerts. So we can create automations within the brain trust platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1884" target="_blank">00:31:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">If my score drops below a certain threshold, let's create an alert, uh, with it, with our automation feature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1893" target="_blank">00:31:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">This is just, uh, and I can maybe walk through what this looks like instead of showing you here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1897" target="_blank">00:31:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, the custom views. This is where like, there's a lot of really rich information within these logs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1905" target="_blank">00:31:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and it becomes really important, I think, again, for the human review component to like filter these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1910" target="_blank">00:31:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">down to the things that they care about, or the things that anybody cares about. So we can create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1914" target="_blank">00:31:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">custom views within brain trust with the appropriate filters. Uh, and then it's very easy for that human to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1919" target="_blank">00:31:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">go into what we call human review mode within brain trust and sort of parse through those logs. Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1925" target="_blank">00:32:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the ones that are the, the ones that are going to be most meaningful to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1928" target="_blank">00:32:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me, uh, let me connect some of those, those dots there. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1936" target="_blank">00:32:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">again, showing you some code, maybe good, maybe bad, but, um, I'm guessing there's some technical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1943" target="_blank">00:32:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">people in the room that don't mind here. So if I look for, um, the, uh, you may have seen in one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1954" target="_blank">00:32:34.280</a></span> | <span class="t">those slides, there is a, you know, the Vercel AI SDK. I want to wrap this AI SDK model. Uh, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1960" target="_blank">00:32:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this allows us to just create all of those metrics within brain trust with just zero lift from us as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1966" target="_blank">00:32:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">developer. This becomes really easy to do. Uh, you can also see where I have specified that span</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1971" target="_blank">00:32:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">itself, right? I actually want to define the inputs and the outputs of that. The reason you would do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1977" target="_blank">00:32:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that is because you have a specific dataset with a structure that you want to ensure maps to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1983" target="_blank">00:33:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So like when you are within those logs, parsing through them, it becomes really easy to add those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1987" target="_blank">00:33:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">spans back to that dataset. So ensuring that that data structure is sort of consistent across offline and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1993" target="_blank">00:33:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">online becomes really important again to create that feedback loop. So this is, you know, very high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=1998" target="_blank">00:33:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">level of like how we can start to create those spans. Um, now that we do, right, we can now go in, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2004" target="_blank">00:33:24.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the platform and start to configure our online scoring. So this is here just within this configuration pane.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2009" target="_blank">00:33:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I can click online scoring. I'll just delete, I'll create a new rule. Uh, so my new rule and here's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2019" target="_blank">00:33:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">where we can add different scores, right? Obviously I have a few here that I've been using for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2024" target="_blank">00:33:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">offline evals. I don't necessarily need to select all of them, but I certainly can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2029" target="_blank">00:33:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I want to, uh, apply a sampling rate. So I want to actually give you an example of what this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2035" target="_blank">00:33:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">looks like. So I'm going to do a hundred percent. The other thing to call out here is that you can apply</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2039" target="_blank">00:33:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">these to the individual spans themselves and not the entire route span. So where this becomes beneficial is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2045" target="_blank">00:34:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like when you are invoking maybe tool calls, you're invoking like a, a rag workflow and you actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2052" target="_blank">00:34:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">want to create a score on whether or not the thing that it gave back, uh, is actually relevant to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2057" target="_blank">00:34:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">user's query. So we can actually create a score specifically for that and highlight what that span</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2062" target="_blank">00:34:22.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is here. So again, very, very flexible in how you apply these scores to the things that are happening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2068" target="_blank">00:34:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">online. Now, when I come back here to the application and we'll just run this again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2077" target="_blank">00:34:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, creating that change log, you'll now start to see here within, uh, the logs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2083" target="_blank">00:34:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">this will start to show up and then you'll start to see these scores be generated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2089" target="_blank">00:34:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. Again, this is where like you can now start to understand over time in production,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2093" target="_blank">00:34:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">how are these things doing? How are they faring? Where can we get better? Uh, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2097" target="_blank">00:34:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">now we can connect again, like the things that are happening in our offline evals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2101" target="_blank">00:35:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">with the things that are happening with online. The other thing to call out here is the, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2106" target="_blank">00:35:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the feedback mechanism, right? Uh, we certainly have, uh, the ability to do like human review,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2111" target="_blank">00:35:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but oftentimes you want your users to provide feedback as well. And so this is just a basic example of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2117" target="_blank">00:35:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a thumbs up, thumbs down, and you can even provide a comment here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2120" target="_blank">00:35:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">This can now be logged to brain trust. So I should see over here my user feedback. So here's my,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2129" target="_blank">00:35:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">my comment. And then I have my user feedback score, but now I can also do something like this. So again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2136" target="_blank">00:35:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe I want to filter my logs down to where user feedback is zero. So click that button. I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2143" target="_blank">00:35:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">change this to zero, right? I don't have any rows yet like that, but now I can save this as a view and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2155" target="_blank">00:35:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">people who are now using this as human review can filter this down to where user feedback equals zero.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2160" target="_blank">00:36:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can figure out what's going on, right? What are the things that, that fell down here within</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2164" target="_blank">00:36:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">this application that we need to go fix? The other thing I'll highlight here is our sort of human review</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2170" target="_blank">00:36:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">component. Uh, actually, um, you, you click that, that button or you can hit just R and it opens up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2176" target="_blank">00:36:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">this, this different pane of your log. So it's a pared down version of what you just saw there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2182" target="_blank">00:36:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a little bit easier for a human to go through and actually look at that, that, that input and that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2187" target="_blank">00:36:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">output. But you as a, as a user of brain trust can configure the human review scores that you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2192" target="_blank">00:36:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">like to, uh, to, to use. So I have this add something here. So maybe this is a little bit more free text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2199" target="_blank">00:36:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a better score. Again, these are the things that, that you can add to your platform that map to the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2205" target="_blank">00:36:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the, the, the, the review, excuse me, the scores that you want your, your humans to, to add to those logs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2215" target="_blank">00:36:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, just really quick, I'll, I'll highlight some of these things here. Um, this is what it starts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2221" target="_blank">00:37:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to look like when you instrument your, uh, your application with those different, um, wrappers or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2226" target="_blank">00:37:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">those different trace functions. Um, I'm able to understand at a very granular level, excuse me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2231" target="_blank">00:37:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">granular level, the things that it's doing, right? So I essentially have these tool calls where it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2235" target="_blank">00:37:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">going out and it's grabbing the commits from GitHub. It's understanding what the latest release is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2240" target="_blank">00:37:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's fetching the commits from that latest release. And now I can generate that change log.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2244" target="_blank">00:37:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, the, the really unique thing here, and maybe a different example of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2248" target="_blank">00:37:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is I can start to score those individual things that are happening. So this is a different, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2255" target="_blank">00:37:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">application with, uh, with this example. So if I open this up, I have these, uh, this conversational</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2264" target="_blank">00:37:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">analytics application. So a user can ask a question and can return back some data. But this application</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2269" target="_blank">00:37:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">goes through these various steps. Like the first step is to rephrase the question that the user asked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2274" target="_blank">00:37:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So imagine like there's this chat history that we can load in as input and the LLM needs to rephrase</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2280" target="_blank">00:38:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that user question. If the LLM does a really bad job of rephrasing this question, everything as a result</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2285" target="_blank">00:38:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of this will fall down. Probably not going to get a right, a right answer. So what I can do is create a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2290" target="_blank">00:38:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">score specifically for that span to understand how well the LLM did in rephrasing that question. You can also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2297" target="_blank">00:38:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">understand the intent that I was able to derive or the LLM was able to derive from that question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2302" target="_blank">00:38:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that right? But you start to think of like these, these more complex type of applications that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2307" target="_blank">00:38:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">build. You need to be able to understand the individual steps that are happening. And Braintrust</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2312" target="_blank">00:38:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">allows for that very, very easily via these scores and then being able to apply them not only again while</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2316" target="_blank">00:38:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you're in offline eval kind of mode, but also online, right? We want to understand these logs and be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2322" target="_blank">00:38:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to apply these scores at the individual span level. This becomes pretty powerful as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2331" target="_blank">00:38:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I actually stole from my next section, my human in the loop. Kind of walked through this a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2337" target="_blank">00:38:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe just another call out. If you happen to be at one of our workshops on Tuesday, Sarah from Notion,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2345" target="_blank">00:39:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">who's a Braintrust customer, talked a little bit about how they think about human in the loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2350" target="_blank">00:39:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's important to consider like the size of her organization and what they're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2355" target="_blank">00:39:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">She mentioned that like she has a special type of role that they use for human in the loop type of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2363" target="_blank">00:39:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">interaction, right? There is, it's almost like a product manager mixed with an LLM specialist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2368" target="_blank">00:39:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">They're the people that are going through and doing those human reviews. Smaller organizations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2372" target="_blank">00:39:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">she made, she made a comment that was, it actually makes a lot of sense for the engineers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2376" target="_blank">00:39:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">some engineers to actually go through and do this as well. It becomes really powerful to pair like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2382" target="_blank">00:39:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">automation with a human component of this. Like this is not going to go away. I think it adds value to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2388" target="_blank">00:39:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2388" target="_blank">00:39:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, I think I just stole from myself like why, why this matters, right? This is really critical for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2395" target="_blank">00:39:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the quality and the reliability of your application.

I walked you through that human review.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2409" target="_blank">00:40:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Give me one second and I'll call you. Yeah. The two, excuse me, the two types, the human review,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2416" target="_blank">00:40:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">being able to like create that interface within Braintrust that allows that user to kind of parse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2421" target="_blank">00:40:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">through the logs in a really easy manner, as well as configuring scores that allow them to add the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2426" target="_blank">00:40:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">relevant scores to that particular log. And then the user feedback. This is actually coming from our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2431" target="_blank">00:40:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">users in the application. Again, being able to create sort of views on top of that feedback that then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2437" target="_blank">00:40:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">power maybe the human review and then creates that flywheel effect that we want. That's all I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2444" target="_blank">00:40:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">today.

The question is around like, how are we using human review and like some of the logs and informing the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2456" target="_blank">00:40:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the, the offline eval portion of this largely that.

I'm going to go back to my initial project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2486" target="_blank">00:41:26.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So, imagine now like we have, we have all of these logs. We filtered it down to a particular, oh.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2504" target="_blank">00:41:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Are we still showing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2514" target="_blank">00:41:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">On the screen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2515" target="_blank">00:41:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Awesome.

We filtered it down to the records that are meaningful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2529" target="_blank">00:42:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">for whatever reason. It becomes really easy again to connect what's happening within production. So I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2534" target="_blank">00:42:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe I select all of these rows or I select individual rows, but I can add these back to the data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2539" target="_blank">00:42:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">set that we're using within those offline evals.

So like maybe within production, we have different models running. Uh, this, this sort of view here allows us to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2595" target="_blank">00:43:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">understand like the, the models that we're using under the hood. Uh, and this is just, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2600" target="_blank">00:43:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you could do this within production as well and sort of do that A/B testing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2604" target="_blank">00:43:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. Uh, my, my second question is about humans in the loop, right? Um, let's suppose that I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2611" target="_blank">00:43:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple humans and, um, they behave, uh, slightly different as his quarter, his quarters. Do you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2621" target="_blank">00:43:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">anything or what, what is the vision to do with that? Like, is there a way that I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2626" target="_blank">00:43:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">actually compare how they're scoring or something like that or not really?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2629" target="_blank">00:43:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So different users can maybe have different sort of criteria for scoring. Maybe the first thing I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2635" target="_blank">00:43:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">would say to that is like, there, there should be like maybe a rubric for your users who are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2639" target="_blank">00:43:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">interacting with human review. So you're not creating that. Uh, you certainly have the ability to see,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2645" target="_blank">00:44:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like who is scoring different things within the platform. Um, I'm not sure if you're able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2650" target="_blank">00:44:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">pull that as like a data set to like assess the differences there, but maybe like before it gets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2655" target="_blank">00:44:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to that place, like have a rubric, have a guideline of, of what scoring looks like for your humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2661" target="_blank">00:44:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Thank you. Yeah, of course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2663" target="_blank">00:44:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Hi. Um, so the scores I'm used to working with for like LLM as a judge are like, they're relativistic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2674" target="_blank">00:44:34.520</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So they can't tell you is the answer relevancy good or bad for a single run, but it can tell you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2682" target="_blank">00:44:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">how it compares to previous iteration of like the same test set, for example. Um, do you guys use LLM</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2692" target="_blank">00:44:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">as a judge scores for online or is, and like, how are, are they relativistic like that? Or do you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2703" target="_blank">00:45:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">some way to be like, this is a good answer, you know, in and of itself for this sample or because it's all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2710" target="_blank">00:45:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you have new data coming in, right? Yeah, I think a lot of our customers who are thinking about this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2714" target="_blank">00:45:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">are, are like almost doing evals on their evals, like trying to understand, did the LLM as a judge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2720" target="_blank">00:45:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">actually do a good job there? So like when that actually runs, there's a rationale behind it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2725" target="_blank">00:45:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can sort of run an eval of those LLMs as a judge. I think Sarah from Notion in our workshop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2731" target="_blank">00:45:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">described sort of a process like that within Notion, but I think that's, that's sort of like where I would aim</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2736" target="_blank">00:45:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">continue. Okay. Cool. Thanks. Cool. Awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2741" target="_blank">00:45:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Are any of your customers doing evals before they launch? Like, I'm working with a government.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2755" target="_blank">00:45:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">they don't want to launch until we show some accuracy levels. Yeah. So we're getting our subject</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2762" target="_blank">00:46:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">matter experts to enter in all the questions that they have, right? And they have huge data sets of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2769" target="_blank">00:46:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">thousands of questions. Believe me, as a government. And then we're using measures like you're talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2778" target="_blank">00:46:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">about. Do you have a way to do that? Like, I guess it's, I guess it's the same. Is it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2786" target="_blank">00:46:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So what you're describing is what we call offline evals, right? This is development, right? We can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2794" target="_blank">00:46:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">actually do this testing before we get into production. This is what I was talking about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2799" target="_blank">00:46:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">like establish that baseline, right? Using those scores, using that data set that you've already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2805" target="_blank">00:46:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">created. But this all happens before we get into production, right? And then you can like, one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2810" target="_blank">00:46:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">things that I heard from somebody earlier is like, one of my challenging things of building this AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2816" target="_blank">00:46:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">application is establishing trust or creating that trust in this thing. That's part of what this is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2824" target="_blank">00:47:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">right? It's like, it's showing, showing those people the scores of that application. So you start to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2830" target="_blank">00:47:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">iterate on this thing. Maybe it starts at 20%, then it goes to 30, then at 40, and so on. That to me is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2835" target="_blank">00:47:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the thing that you use to create that trust and create that like groundswell to push it into production.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2840" target="_blank">00:47:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Yeah, that is what we're trying to do. But I wondered if I can see the tool does that. Thank</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2847" target="_blank">00:47:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you. Yeah, of course. Time for one more. Thanks. Quick question. I love the CICD components. We're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2856" target="_blank">00:47:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to build a lot of -- we're trying to build like MLS as a platform for our team. So we get into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2861" target="_blank">00:47:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">evals and stuff like that. So how much of the monitoring dashboard you have in BrainTrust can actually be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2868" target="_blank">00:47:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like take the data taken out and posted in a unified dashboard somewhere else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2872" target="_blank">00:47:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. All of this is available via SDK, right? You can pull down experiments. You can pull down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2879" target="_blank">00:47:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">data sets. So you're able to, you know, pull this down. Like we have -- we have a customer that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2884" target="_blank">00:48:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">actually building their own UI on top of like the SDK itself. Like so they built their own sort of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2889" target="_blank">00:48:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">components utilizing the SDK and pulling the sort of things that we've logged, the experiments that we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2896" target="_blank">00:48:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in the application into their own UI. So it's certainly possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0TmxoZlUY&t=2899" target="_blank">00:48:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Awesome.
