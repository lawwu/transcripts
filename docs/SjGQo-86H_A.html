target="_blank">00:02:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the other one happened like, I think, within the past three years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGQo-86H_A&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think how I dealt with it and how I process it was very different based on just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjGQo-86H_A&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">how long I've been in the
