So let's get the text in front of us so that we can see what the real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">help is that the Scripture gives precisely at this point. Because you're right to focus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">right on this issue. First Corinthians 7, 8, 9 says, "To the unmarried and the widows, I say that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it is good for them to remain single as I am, but if they cannot exercise self-control, they should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion." So, Mark, you're right to see marriage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">as a God-designed help in dealing with the overpowering passions and sexual desires. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">what it says.

Same thing in 1 Corinthians 7 earlier, verses 2 to 5, it says, "But because of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights"â€”it's a fancy way of saying, "have sex</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">with her when it's helpful for her, and likewise the wife to her husband." So sex with him when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it's helpful for him. "For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Likewise, the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does." Each has a claim</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">on the other for sexual relations. "Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">limited time." Here comes this interesting part. "That you may devote yourself to prayer, but then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control." So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">clearly, Paul is teaching that God has designed sexual relations in marriage as a way to weaken</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">sinful impulses towards adultery.

So let me say one other thing that I think is so important,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">unless I create an artificial view of marriage. Marriage in the sexual relations, at their best,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">create a firewall between the couple and adultery and pornography in other ways besides</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">merely physical. We shouldn't think of the protection from sin merely in terms of sexual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">relations as a physical release, kind of like a pressure valve that got to keep this guy from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">exploding in all the wrong places, so he's got to have this pressure valve released every now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and then. That's a truth, but it's not the totality of what's going on when Paul says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that sexual relations are a firewall. There's more to it than that, and I think in our culture,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">which has so prostituted sex into a hookup weekend sport, it's very hard for them to grasp what I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">about to say. God intends that in the intimacies of physical union in marriage, something amazing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">glorious, beautiful, spiritual take place. Depths of affection, covenant intensification,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">spiritual union, unfathomable personal bonding take place, which as they grow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">these depths of union make pornography and adultery more and more unthinkable. That's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">real glory of sexual relations in marriage. So, Mark, as you go on fighting for sexual purity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in your single life by the power of the Spirit, that's what you should dream of and pray toward</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in marriage. That's really great counsel on marriage and in principle, words that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">applicable to a lot of life, talking about the physical helps and spiritual battles,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">even though none of those helps are absolute cures.

Thank you, Pastor John.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oEw_7Y4ArE&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And Mark, thank you for the question.
