href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">are building agentic systems I love it so when we talk about agentic AI I think it's important that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">level set from an AWS perspective there are three key terms we need to think about first the ability to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">plan agent gets a prompt it gets an objective and it determines the actions that need to be taken so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">creates the plan and then it takes actions on those actions by using things like tools now the last piece</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the third piece the third piece and probably the most interesting is the reasoning where the agent is able to evaluate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the results and determine if it needs to update the plan and take additional actions until the objective is complete this is an agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.860</a></span> | <span class="t">now when we actually break down the architecture I think it's important to take a look at this because we have the user input we have the agentic system we have the possibility of some type of human in the loop and then we have the generator response</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.860</a></span> | <span class="t">response now when we dive a little deeper there are some components of this agentic system we have the LLM we have a knowledge base with external information that we may want to provide we have guardrails to say to the model don't do this or to ground the model with the truth from our knowledge base to say okay is this actually relevant information is this accurate to the information we're receiving from the knowledge base</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and then we have access to additional tools memory or we may need to talk to additional agents or LLMs like Amazon over at do something like MCP and we have the ability to design our own flows for these systems</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.860</a></span> | <span class="t">now the most interesting piece that I think a lot of us are probably focused on when we're building these systems is around the continuous evaluation framework like how do we know if we're using the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">right LLM how do we know if our prompt is consistent accurate or even optimized for the performance we're expecting and then how do we even judge our system how do we rate that and determine that that it's actually solving the problems that we need or intend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.860</a></span> | <span class="t">now once we have this we need to log this information and then have some type of subject matter expert and determine how can we improve this system and this is the iterative approach so we're always trying to improve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and optimize our agent system now continuing on this continuing on with this story now there are some use cases that we should be building these systems for like if it's complex tasks and we don't know which tool should be used how many tools should be used and we want the model to leverage his reasoning capabilities well this is a great use case for agent system but if it's something that is just one step</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.860</a></span> | <span class="t">our traditional if this then that approach is probably the best solution right we don't always need to provide some type of agency system for something that can be done with a traditional solution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">now when we talk about agents on AWS there are three approaches and perspectives we should think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.860</a></span> | <span class="t">first it's going to be the specialized using something like Amazon Q how many of you are have used Amazon Q the there's Amazon Q in the console to help solve your problems on AWS in the console</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.860</a></span> | <span class="t">there's Amazon Q developer inside of your IDE and right now one that I'm I would think most excited about is Amazon Q CLI agent how many of you have used that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.860</a></span> | <span class="t">for me if you if you are into increasing your productivity using a CI CLI agent has helped me tremendously from editing the video it can do that summarizing the document reading my entire code base like today for one of my demos I had some code and I was trying to figure out why wasn't it working I said analyze this code and tell me what you see let me know what you see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">let me know the API's that it's calling well I looked at the API's well it didn't match my API's in the API gateway so when the code was deployed it wasn't deployed with the right API's so the agent was able to help me save a ton of time by just analyzing the code and tell me what it saw because I never seen the code before right so that's what these tools are able to help us do the next is fully managed if you're using Amazon bedrock you're able to leverage Amazon bedrock agents to build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.860</a></span> | <span class="t">build and manage agents inside AWS and today what we're going to be focused on is the DIY to do-it-yourself approach by using strands agents this is allows you to not just leverage Amazon bedrock but also leverage models through other providers using light LLM</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">now when we talk about strands agents strands agent was announced about a month ago I want to say something about a month ago this is open source extremely lightweight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.860</a></span> | <span class="t">so if you use other agents flat frameworks is like that but the implementation is you'll see in the code how easy it is to build an agentic system or agent itself in a few lines of code and already get started I built a multi-agent solution in about under 50 lines of code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and so when we break down strands agents there are three components we have a prompt we have a LLM and we have tools so you create a function called let's say a get weather tool right you define your agent you give it a prompt and it's already implemented and you'll see in the code as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">as banjo goes through here in a moment now taking it a step further as danielle presented today on amazon nova act</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">these models are able to do some really cool things and this is another thing that i'm excited about amazon nova act is a research preview model and the capabilities of this allows you to use a prompt or give instructions and take complex tasks and do the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and take complex tasks and do things like browse the internet to find research or to research or to search on amazon.com to find the top list of widgets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">right and then return them and then add them to your card so you'll see how we can leverage this not just using the sdk for amazon nova act but also by leveraging mcp which leads us into the last piece which i think when we're talking about agents i</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">i don't think we will be here today as fast as we have moved if it wasn't for mcp how many of you are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">leveraging mcp today model context protocol how many of you have built your own mcp servers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">i built several um i got two that i use all the time one how many of you use obsidian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">okay so for my documentation i built obsidian mcp server this allows me to save all my documents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.500</a></span> | <span class="t">reference all my documents and just my entire workflow is streamlined because of this mcp server i use right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">there but i also use one for my bookmarks i built a bookmark manager because every friday i'm restarting my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">i'm restarting my computer and i lose my bookmarks i save them and i forget about them but now i can just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">say save this bookmark it gives it a description gives it a title give it a date and i can even add</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">notes so i can remember where this bookmark so now when i open up qcli i can say hey i'm looking on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.140</a></span> | <span class="t">topic i'm looking for um some information on mcp can you tell me all the bookmarks that i have then it'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.260</a></span> | <span class="t">find it can you tell me the ones i saved last week and so these this is the power that we have today but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">but with that being said i think it's time that we all start building banjo is going to take over but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=567"

module is just getting started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.140</a></span> | <span class="t">with nova act we're going to make an api call that the second part of the module is going to make an mcp</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">server that can leverage an nova act and finally we're going to use the strands agent to cook</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.900</a></span> | <span class="t">everything together so that's kind of the the three steps we'll go through at this workshop and all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.380</a></span> | <span class="t">code is available via the link on github so you can try it on your own as well uh but yeah trying to get</span></div><div class="c"><span

architectures you could use um and what i can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2518" target="_blank">00:41:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">imagine using this is uh like you have a coordinator agent set up somewhere that's running in the overall</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2524" target="_blank">00:42:04.860</a></span> | <span class="t">app and then when something pops up and says hey you need to go and look this up online go and check it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2530" target="_blank">00:42:10.220</a></span> | <span class="t">uh it should mod so my question is how modular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2534" target="_blank">00:42:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">i mean it's just python so it should be pretty modular right is that the way in which you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2539" target="_blank">00:42:19.740</a></span> | <span class="t">imagining the architecture to be is just if i was coding a coordinator agent in lang chain or lang graph</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2546" target="_blank">00:42:26.300</a></span> | <span class="t">for example it would then call your sub-agent and get and and run it stuff and then get and then get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2553" target="_blank">00:42:33.100</a></span> | <span class="t">a text-based output that i throw into my message queue that's how it all integrates together is that right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2560" target="_blank">00:42:40.220</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah that's one way you can do it so nova act again right it's a python so it could be a tool it could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2564" target="_blank">00:42:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">an api call and the next module we're actually going to show you how to actually make an agent from that so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2569" target="_blank">00:42:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">good good t up right here uh so um juan talked about the strands uh at the beginning so strands is a new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2577" target="_blank">00:42:57.100</a></span> | <span class="t">agentic framework launched by uh aws so let me open up the link uh it's easy as a pip install strands</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2584" target="_blank">00:43:04.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and the first agent is like agent equals that so it's very it's a model first uh way of interacting with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2591" target="_blank">00:43:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">agents if you use a lot of agent frameworks in the past there's a lot of bootstrapping and making sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2596" target="_blank">00:43:16.460</a></span> | <span class="t">everything is correct and like but that was necessary for kind of the older models like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2600" target="_blank">00:43:20.380</a></span> | <span class="t">if you think back to like like llama 2 for example like how how far our models have evolved since then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2605" target="_blank">00:43:25.740</a></span> | <span class="t">so but now we we can pass a lot of the you know bootstrapping we did previously the agent can figure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2611" target="_blank">00:43:31.900</a></span> | <span class="t">that out so we don't need all these very uh heavy ways and like you know make sure everything's typed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2616" target="_blank">00:43:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">and every so whatnot so here's a very simple example of how i actually spun up uh and also it has mcp</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2624" target="_blank">00:43:44.060</a></span> | <span class="t">native support so in this example i actually have two mcp servers uh i have the aws documentation and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2631" target="_blank">00:43:51.500</a></span> | <span class="t">aws diagrams mcp server so if you go to this like aws labs mcp these are the official um aws mcp servers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2639" target="_blank">00:43:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and there's a bunch of different ones from like a cost analysis nova canvas diagramming cloud formation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2646" target="_blank">00:44:06.460</a></span> | <span class="t">lots of different ones here uh so again it's all on github aws labs mcp but the example i do here is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2653" target="_blank">00:44:13.900</a></span> | <span class="t">i'm actually i made like a solutions architect agent your role is to help customers understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2658" target="_blank">00:44:18.780</a></span> | <span class="t">this building on aws and i define these two mcp servers here i give it a prompt and i say this agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2667" target="_blank">00:44:27.020</a></span> | <span class="t">has all the tools in the mcp server it has a bedrock model i'm using cloud haiku here and what's cool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2673" target="_blank">00:44:33.740</a></span> | <span class="t">about strands it can also use like light llm and olama so it has access to lots of different things or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2679" target="_blank">00:44:39.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you can run it locally and of course it has access to amazon bedrock so that's what we're using here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2683" target="_blank">00:44:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">so all those three things makes the agent the tools the model and the system prompt and then i can say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2690" target="_blank">00:44:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">get

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2718" target="_blank">00:45:18.220</a></span> | <span class="t">okay so it uses uv to install the mcp server locally a lot of people i don't know where does mcp run this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2725" target="_blank">00:45:25.100</a></span> | <span class="t">is running

target="_blank">00:45:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">testing it out it pulls down the the mcp server locally and runs it you can see it's already executing</span></div><div class="c"><span

you with that first i'm going to search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFTVEDYVJT0&t=2745" target="_blank">00:45:45.020</a></span> | <span
