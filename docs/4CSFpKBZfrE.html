God is preparing a great loaf of bread in these various ethnic settings, and he's kneading the dough with his fingers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Piper's role for those few days he has, Piper's role as one of the co-workers with God is to contribute a certain kind of biblical leaven and some theological spices that I hope and pray might add just a little nutriment to the bread and a little flavor to the dough that would make it even more nourishing to the church and to the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But God's the baker, and he's doing the kneading, and he decides what goes into this bread and what doesn't, and he decides what the loaf looks like when it comes out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't think we should have illusions when we do ministries like online work like at DG, like we're going to shape and control the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's just ridiculous. The world is huge, complex, and God is running it, not us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in Brazil and Argentina, that included messages focused on God is the gospel, God himself is the greatest, best, final good of the good news, leading to messages on Christian hedonism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, if God is the gospel, if he's the greatest good, how does that impact the way we worship and the way we love people?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that led to, okay, if God is the gospel and this is the way you glorify him through being satisfied in him and loving people, then how do you preach?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">With expository exaltation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That was kind of the package or the cluster of truths that we laid out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, it should not go without saying, I suppose, that the tables are always turned and I go to encourage them and to nourish them and to make my little contribution of spices and nutriments into the loaf.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I leave probably more affected and more encouraged than I gave or than I influenced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's just, here's one example.

Anecdotally, looking back, is there anything you take away, any striking settings or environments or experiences that you'll never forget from this trip?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If I think back on one of the most striking things, it would be being a part of the conference in Campina Grande in the north of Brazil, where I spoke twice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what made that so amazing, it's a huge tent that holds about 12,000 people and about 100,000 people come through this conference in the week that it's held.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's so striking is that 20 years ago, that city was totally dominated at this time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, this is the Mardi Gras time and what they call it Carnival.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's pretty bleak. Like, like, here's a woman walking around in scanty clads, a little sign around her neck.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">She's got horns, she's got devil horns. And the sign around her neck says, "Are you still afraid to go to hell?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Meaning, "I'll be there. Cool. Come." So that's the kind of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, this conference grew from a little teeny apologetics conference to offset things that were being said about the occult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And now has become the event and Carnival has been pushed out of the city.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So all of those, which I would call godless, cultic, satanic influences are still there, but they're marginalized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I saw them walking around the lake where our hotel was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But as far as the center city that used to be filled with these influences, it's now filled with gospel preaching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I was blown away by my experience of standing before this sea of people hungry for the word of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The expulsive power of the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that was the effect. And the man who leads it is just a powerhouse of vision and energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's another little note.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's probably, I can't remember exactly what his background is, but he would be, you know, just broadly, big heartedly, Bible evangelical guy who loves Jesus and wants to see the gospel triumph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet when when things started to grow, he looked around for counsel as to who he should invite to these events.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he began to trust, this is my understanding anyway, to trust the key leaders of this Reformed awakening who gave him names.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like he doesn't know me from Adam.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he trusted them to let me address what he has grown up under God's hand to address there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's a stream of very Bible oriented and Reformed spokesmen, not only, but largely who are coming to that event.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CSFpKBZfrE&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Excellent.
