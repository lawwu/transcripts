Let's review the topics of today. I will be starting by introducing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=9" target="_blank">00:00:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">what is machine learning interpretability.

Then we will see a nice little trick, so how to trick a classifier. So imagine that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=23" target="_blank">00:00:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you have a classification neural network, like for example a convolutional neural network</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=28" target="_blank">00:00:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that can classify pictures into classes. For example it will tell you that the picture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of a dog is a dog, the picture of a person is a person, etc. Our goal is, without touching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">anything of this model, so without touching its weights, without touching its parameters,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.760</a></span> | <span class="t">its structure or anything related to the model, we want any classifier to be tricked into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">believing that for example the picture of a dog is actually a person or the picture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.620</a></span> | <span class="t">of a person is actually a dog. And we will see how we can trick any classifier of our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">choice. Later I will be introducing an interpretability engine, so a library that allows us to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">vision models more interpretable. We will explore the topic of feature visualization</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">which is very important for interpretability. And finally we will apply the techniques that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we have learned to language models, so how to make language models more interpretable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">What are the prerequisites for watching this video? Well for sure that we have a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">background in calculus, I think knowing what are derivatives and how to calculate them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is enough. And also of course that you have a background in deep learning, so you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">what is a loss function or what is the softmax function for example. So let's start our journey.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">What is machine learning interpretability? In 2016 there was a fatal accident between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a Tesla car driver and a truck. And as reported by the Guardian, we can see that the car sensor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">system against a bright spring sky failed to distinguish a large white 18 wheel truck</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and trailer crossing the highway. So basically the car was going and it failed to recognize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">this obstacle which was the truck. And the car just attempted to drive full speed under</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">this truck. Of course resulting in the crash and it was unfortunately fatal. Now I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">want to say that it was Tesla's fault or it was the software's fault, I don't have enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">information for that. So let's make a hypothetical case like you are creating a self-driving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">company and you want to deploy your car, self-driving car. How do you make sure that the car can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">recognize any obstacle? How do you know what your model has learned? Because for example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">if the car, the first question that you want to answer is what your model has learned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">For example imagine that you have a model that allows you to segment the obstacles on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the road. The first question that you want to answer is what did my model learn? So how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">does my model recognize a person? Does it recognize a person by its shape or does it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.360</a></span> | <span class="t">recognize a person by its shoes or by the color of the clothes etc? Knowing this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">important. Why? Because this allows us to understand what could be a failure mode of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">our model. Because if our model is only looking at the color of the clothes for example to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">recognize a person, so only looking at the clothes and not at the face for example, then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">if one day the model will see a person that is wearing strange clothes, something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the model has never seen, the model may fail to recognize that person as an obstacle. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this is very important. So the second question that we want to answer is what features or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">patterns from the input make the model generate certain outputs? And this is very important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">for example for language models. So imagine our language model is a cursing and we want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to understand which tokens in the input are being used by the model to generate that kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of output. Knowing how a model thinks, and pardon me for this word, it's very wrong,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">so let's think about knowing how a model predicts or makes its prediction, allow us to debug</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and fine tune the model, which means that during training we can understand why our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">model is not learning something that we want it to learn, or how should we change our hyperparameters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that will affect the learning of our model.

It can increase trust because we can demonstrate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that our model is well trained and so people will trust it and this is especially for some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">scenarios like self-driving cars. And also we can discover novel insights from the data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">because sometimes models learn something that we as humans did not see, and this is very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">important when the models learn patterns, for example in image models, that humans did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">not see. This is for example in the healthcare sector, imagine that you are training a model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that can recognize cancer cells from non-cancer cells, and we realize that the model is performing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">well and we realize that the model is looking at some parts of the cell that we as humans</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't think of checking before, that is actually a good predictor for the cell being cancerous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">or not cancerous, so even the model can teach us something that we did not before. When</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we define a linear layer in PyTorch it gets converted into a computation graph, for example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in this case we have an input that is made up of two features, which means that the input</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is a vector made up of X1 and X2.

In this case</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">this is actually a simplified version of the computation graph.

In this case we can see that X1 and X2 are multiplied by some weights in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">first neuron and then we sum up a bias, we apply the ReLU and this becomes the input</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">for the neuron at the next layer.

How do we train such a network? Well, usually we have a dataset made</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">up of inputs and output pairs, or input and label pairs.

Our hope is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the neural network not only learns the data that it has seen during training, so not only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it can predict correctly the price of the houses that it has seen during training, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it also learns some kind of pattern that can generalize to unseen inputs.

We choose a loss function and we choose, for example, the mean squared</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">error in this case. We run an input through the neural network.

So if you remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">from high school, the gradient is basically a derivative. So imagine we do it for a single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">variable. So imagine that we have, we want to calculate the derivative of the loss function</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">with respect to W_11. So we write it here. This is the loss function and this is W_11.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Imagine that the loss function is doing something like this. We have a kind of a local minima</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">here and then we have a global minima here. Imagine that we are currently here. Our W_11</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">initially is here. When we calculate the derivative of the loss function with respect to W_11,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we will get the inclination of the tangent line at this point, which is this one here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And this indicates the direction in which the function is growing. So the function is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">growing in this direction. We usually update our weights to move to the opposite direction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">of the gradient. So we update our weights to move right so that the loss will diminish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, we take a little step in this direction so that the loss, as you can see,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">will decrease because this will be the new loss 2. We started from loss 1 here. And this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is why we do backpropagation. So we calculate this gradient, so the gradient of the loss</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">function with respect to the parameters of the model. And then we update the models to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">move against the direction of the gradient. The first thing that we do during our training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is the forward pass, which means that we have an input. We run it through our computation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">graph to calculate an output. So let's do it here. So we have an input that is X_1=2</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and X_2=4. We multiply, for example here in this node, each input by the weights of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">network and the weights are initialized as follows. So W_11=0.24, W_12=0.29, the bias</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of W_11=-0.70. This will result in some co-activations being calculated, so the values of each node</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">are called activations. We use the previous activation to calculate the next one, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">etc. until we arrive to the output of this neural network. We have a target because we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">are training and we can calculate a loss. What do we do with this loss? We run backpropagation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">which means that we calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of these weights. For example, to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to W_11, which is this parameter here, we can use the chain rule, which means that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">derivative of the loss function with respect to A_6, because we need to watch what are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the nodes that connect this parameter to the loss.

So that's why we have a minus sign here. Now, let's trick a classifier. So I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">introduced the gradient descent because it was needed for us to understand how to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">this trick.

A classifier is a neural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">network that can classify the input into one of the defined classes that we have.

For example, the ResNet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">network can classify the input picture into one of the thousand classes it has in its</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">output logits. The output of a neural network of this kind is called logits, because it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">indicates what is the score that the network assigns to each of these classes.

A softmax is a function that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">makes the logits kind of turn them into probability scores, because they will sum up to one. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">then we take the class with the highest value of the softmax as the prediction of the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=913" target="_blank">00:15:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So if after applying softmax, we see that our network indicated that this node here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is 95%, then it means that the network is saying us that this is a fish. And that also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">applies to other cases, of course. So what do I mean by tricking a classifier? I mean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that I give you a classifier, so a neural network like this one, and you are not allowed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to change anything of the network. So you're not allowed to change the weights of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">network, you're not allowed to change the architecture of this network, you're not allowed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to change anything. So the weights are frozen, and the architecture and the hyperparameter,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">everything is frozen. When we run a picture of a fish in this network, it will probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">classify it as a fish. But our goal, we want to give a picture of a fish as input, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we want the network to classify it as something else that we can choose, for example, as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">volcano with very high probability. So of course, if you think about it, the only place</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">where we can work to trick this network is actually in the input. And this is what we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">will do. We will change the input in such a way that the network will not see a fish</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">anymore, but it will see, for example, a volcano. So this fish and the previous fish are the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">same for a human because you can see a fish and I can see a fish. But what we did was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to add a little bit of noise in this picture so that when the network sees this picture,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">so this one here, it will not see a fish anymore, it will see a volcano. How is that even possible?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's see. So our goal is that we want to have a picture as input and we want to change</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">this picture in such a way that the network sees something else. How can we proceed? Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we take what we do usually when we train a network like this is this. We have a series</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of pictures of images of fish, of trees, of people, etc. and the corresponding label.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, we have a thousand pictures of dogs and the label saying that they are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">dogs. And then we have a thousand pictures of cats and saying that the corresponding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">label is cat, etc. So what we do is we feed the input picture to the neural network. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">neural network will calculate some output, which is here, to which we apply the Softmax.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we have the corresponding label because we know what is this picture. This is coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">from our training data. So we know that is a fish, for example, in this case. We can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">calculate the loss. Then we can run backpropagation, which means that we calculated the gradient</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of the loss function with respect to the weights of this network, so the parameters of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">network. And then we update the parameters to reduce this loss. And this is how we train</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">this network. So let's try to see how we can trick the network into believing that, for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1089" target="_blank">00:18:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">example, this fish here is actually a volcano. Now, when we do the training, as you saw before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we calculated the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters, but we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">actually calculate also the gradient of the loss function with respect to the input picture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we can do is as follows. We can create a new loss function. So imagine we have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1113" target="_blank">00:18:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">picture of a fish. We know it's a fish, but we want to trick the model into believing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a volcano. We can create a loss function with respect to the target that we want the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">network to have. So we want the network to believe it's a volcano, so we can create a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">new loss function with respect to the target volcano. And then we run this picture in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1131" target="_blank">00:18:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">network and we calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the input. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1135" target="_blank">00:18:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">later we will see in the code how to do that. But let's try to analyze what does it mean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1141" target="_blank">00:19:01.340</a></span> | <span class="t">to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the input. It means that it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">will indicate a direction in which we should change the input to make, because it's a gradient,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.460</a></span> | <span class="t">so it indicates the direction in which we should change the input to make the loss grow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1157" target="_blank">00:19:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can run backpropagation and optimization on the input to decrease this loss. So because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the gradient tells us how we should change the input image to make the loss grow, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1171" target="_blank">00:19:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">can also change the input image in the opposite direction to make the loss decrease. So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1178" target="_blank">00:19:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">what we will do. We calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the input</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1184" target="_blank">00:19:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">image, which will indicate a direction. We update the image with some noise in the opposite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1190" target="_blank">00:19:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">direction, so we add a little bit of noise in the opposite direction indicated by this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">gradient, and we keep updating it until the network predicts correctly the output as Volcano.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1202" target="_blank">00:20:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the code it is done as follows. Imagine we have a model, we have an input image, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1208" target="_blank">00:20:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we have a target class, for example, Volcano. What we can do is we take our input image</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and we create a tensor of it by asking PyTorch to also calculate the gradient with respect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1219" target="_blank">00:20:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to this tensor, because by default PyTorch will only calculate the gradient with respect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to the weights. So the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1226" target="_blank">00:20:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we also want the gradient with respect to this input image. Then we run for a few steps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the following. We calculate the output of the model, so we are calculating this output</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1237" target="_blank">00:20:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">here. We are creating a special loss function with respect to this target that we want the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1243" target="_blank">00:20:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">network to have. So we want the network to output Volcano, so we create a loss function</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1248" target="_blank">00:20:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">with respect to this target class. We run backward, which means that we calculate the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">gradient of the loss function with respect to the input. And then we update the image,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1261" target="_blank">00:21:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">so the image is updated just like the update formula for the parameters, so it's equal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to the old image minus some learning rate, here I call it alpha, multiplied by the direction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1273" target="_blank">00:21:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of the gradient of the loss function with respect to the input. And we are moving against</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1280" target="_blank">00:21:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the direction of the gradient because we want the loss to decrease. If we update the image</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">continuously as follows, we will see that the network will predict it as Volcano. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this is how we can trick a classifier. I made this example because I wanted to show you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that models may look at patterns that are completely different from us humans. For example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in this case, the model is predicting this picture as a Volcano. So the model somehow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is seeing a Volcano here, even if to us humans, we will never be able to see a Volcano in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1314" target="_blank">00:21:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this picture, it's a fish. So understanding how our model makes its prediction can help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1322" target="_blank">00:22:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">us improve our models.

In this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">case, it looks like that the model is well trained, because by generating prototype,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we can get the kind of input that the model wants to see to classify it as a target class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1390" target="_blank">00:23:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is the kind of picture that the model wants to see to classify the input picture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">as a hamburger.

And it actually resembles a pancake. And this one actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1405" target="_blank">00:23:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">resembles a hamburger, which means that the model has learned the correct features from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1411" target="_blank">00:23:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the food to classify it as a given class. But we will see later a case in which this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1416" target="_blank">00:23:36.700</a></span> | <span class="t">is not true. Another feature of the Leap Labs interpretability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">engine is entanglement. Entanglement allows us to understand how different classes share</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1427" target="_blank">00:23:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">features. For example, for a food classifier like the one we saw before, we expect high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">entanglement between the ice cream class and frozen yogurt class. Because at least for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">me as a human, they look very similar. They both look like ice cream. So it is expected</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1445" target="_blank">00:24:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that these two classes share features. But imagine that you have a more broad classifier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1450" target="_blank">00:24:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">like the one we saw before that can classify fish and volcano, etc. I would not expect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1456" target="_blank">00:24:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">for example, cheesecake and dog to have high entanglement. Because at least for me, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1463" target="_blank">00:24:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">shouldn't share features. I mean, they are totally different objects. So if they do have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1469" target="_blank">00:24:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">high entanglement in the model, it means that the model is looking at the wrong features.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1479" target="_blank">00:24:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And it also may indicate a higher chance of misclassification between these two classes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Another feature that is very important is feature isolation. So in this case, feature</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1492" target="_blank">00:24:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">isolation allows us, for example, to understand which parts of the input is being used by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1497" target="_blank">00:24:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the model to make a certain prediction. For example, for a food classifier, imagine we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1502" target="_blank">00:25:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">have the following picture. The food classifier will classify it as a frozen yogurt with 98%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1511" target="_blank">00:25:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">probability. But by generating feature isolation, we can understand which part of the input</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1517" target="_blank">00:25:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">is being used to classify the input as a frozen yogurt. And it's actually the part that looks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1523" target="_blank">00:25:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like frozen yogurt. But also because there is entanglement between frozen yogurt and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1529" target="_blank">00:25:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">ice cream, the model, as you can see, is using the similar features to also classify it as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1534" target="_blank">00:25:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">ice cream with low probability because the model is well trained. But still, they have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1538" target="_blank">00:25:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">some shared features, as you can see. And there is something that you may not have noticed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1543" target="_blank">00:25:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">but is the waffles. With very low probability, the model may also classify it as a waffle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1548" target="_blank">00:25:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Why? Because the model is seeing some features, which are the berries that are on this frozen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1555" target="_blank">00:25:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">yogurt, to classify it as a waffle. This can happen because in the original picture, in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1561" target="_blank">00:26:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the training data, the waffles probably had the berries on top. So the model learned to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1566" target="_blank">00:26:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">look at the berries to recognize a waffle. So the LeapLabs Interstability Engine can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1571" target="_blank">00:26:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">understand this and will show you this. This helps you understand what your model has learned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1578" target="_blank">00:26:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Now let's look at a case on when things can go wrong in our model and how LeapLabs Interstability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1585" target="_blank">00:26:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Engine can help us improve it. If you look at the tutorial link that I have shared in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1593" target="_blank">00:26:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the description, if you go to this link here, to the tutorials at the LeapLabs website,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you will see tank detection case study. And if you open it, it will open a call up notebook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1608" target="_blank">00:26:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now let's run it, actually. So let me change run type. We choose T for GPU, and we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1615" target="_blank">00:26:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">run it. It will do some imports. Now, what is the tank detection case study? Well, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1622" target="_blank">00:27:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">are talking about a classification model that can detect tanks or no tanks. So it has only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1628" target="_blank">00:27:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">two classes that indicate if the picture contains a tank or it does not contain a tank. Suppose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1634" target="_blank">00:27:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that this is a model that is very important for us, and we want to deploy it in the battlefield</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1638" target="_blank">00:27:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">because it can help protect our soldiers. But before deploying it, of course, we want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to understand what our model has learned. So by understanding what our model has learned,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1649" target="_blank">00:27:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we can predict failure modes. So if we run, for example, a picture of a tank into our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1657" target="_blank">00:27:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">classification model, we will see that it classified as having a tank with a very high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1663" target="_blank">00:27:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">probability. So in this case, the model is predicting that there is a tank in this picture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1667" target="_blank">00:27:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">with 98% probability. So it looks like the model is performing very well. But let's try</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1673" target="_blank">00:27:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to use the LeapLabs interoperability engine to understand what our model has learned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1678" target="_blank">00:27:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So we install the library. Then we can use the library to generate prototypes. As we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1683" target="_blank">00:28:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">saw before, the prototype tells us what kind of input the model wants to see to classify</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1689" target="_blank">00:28:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a certain output, to give a certain output. In this case, we need the LeapLabs API key,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1695" target="_blank">00:28:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">which we can generate from the LeapLabs website. So we go to the dashboard, we go settings,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1702" target="_blank">00:28:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and it will generate a key here. We put our key in the API key and we can generate a prototype.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1721" target="_blank">00:28:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">In my computer, it takes around 25 seconds, I think, or one minute to generate it. Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1727" target="_blank">00:28:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the model has generated, the library has generated two prototypes, one for the tank class. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1735" target="_blank">00:28:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">what kind of input the model wants to see to tell us that there is a tank and what kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1742" target="_blank">00:29:02.620</a></span> | <span class="t">of input the model wants to see to tell us that there is no tank. And let's look at this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1748" target="_blank">00:29:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">picture which indicates when the output indicates that there is a tank. If we look at this picture,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1754" target="_blank">00:29:14.020</a></span> | <span class="t">you see that actually there is no tank. So it means that the model is looking at some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1759" target="_blank">00:29:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff that is gray, which probably looks like a cloud. But there is no tank here. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1766" target="_blank">00:29:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I expected to see a cannon, I expected to see some wheels or maybe the gun or a soldier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1770" target="_blank">00:29:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">with a gun on top of the tank or something like this, but actually there is none of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1774" target="_blank">00:29:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">features. So is our model looking at the correct features to actually predict a tank, the presence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1781" target="_blank">00:29:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of a tank? And let's look at the other class, no tank. As we can see, we have these green</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1788" target="_blank">00:29:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">lines here, which probably indicates grass. So probably the model is looking at the grass</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1794" target="_blank">00:29:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to indicate that there is no tank. So if it sees an open field with only grass, it will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1801" target="_blank">00:30:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">say that there is no tank, which could make sense. But the problem is, why is our model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1805" target="_blank">00:30:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">not looking at the tank to indicate that there is a tank? So let's try to make a prediction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1812" target="_blank">00:30:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">before looking further at what the LeapLabs Interpolating Engine can tell us. What could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1819" target="_blank">00:30:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">happen in this case is that imagine that in our training data, we have a lot of pictures</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1824" target="_blank">00:30:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of tanks and all of them that have tanks happen to have cloudy sky. So what our model may</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1832" target="_blank">00:30:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">have learned is that if there is a cloudy sky, then there is a tank, not that if there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1837" target="_blank">00:30:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is a tank, there is a tank. So let's validate our hypothesis. We can use a feature isolation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1843" target="_blank">00:30:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to understand what kind of features from an input picture the model is looking at to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1848" target="_blank">00:30:48.700</a></span> | <span class="t">a certain prediction. So in this case, for example, we can feed the picture that we saw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1855" target="_blank">00:30:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">before. So this picture as input to see what kind of features the model is looking at to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1861" target="_blank">00:31:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">predict a tank. Let's see. As you can see, the model is using the entire picture to actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1879" target="_blank">00:31:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">predict a tank.

And the other areas indicate that the feature is being used. So as you can see,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1889" target="_blank">00:31:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the tank is here is white, which means that the model is not using the tank to predict</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1895" target="_blank">00:31:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the tank, but it's using the sky and maybe the ground to predict that there is a tank.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1901" target="_blank">00:31:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So as suspected, the model doesn't seem to use the actual tank for classification much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1906" target="_blank">00:31:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">at all, right? It's using the sky, the background, and maybe the saturation of the picture. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1911" target="_blank">00:31:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">how can we fix this model? Well, one way to fix it is to further train the model by using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1918" target="_blank">00:31:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">more diverse images of tanks that have maybe some sunny sky, maybe some cloudy sky, maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1924" target="_blank">00:32:04.500</a></span> | <span class="t">some snowing environment with snow and some environment maybe in the forest, etc, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1931" target="_blank">00:32:11.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So that the model cannot find any other correlation between pictures of tanks except for the tank</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1938" target="_blank">00:32:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">itself. So that the model will be forced to learn the presence of the tank itself as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1945" target="_blank">00:32:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">predictor for tanks. We can run this training and it will for sure improve our model. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1951" target="_blank">00:32:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">there is a code here to how to train it again. And after training, we can run feature isolation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1956" target="_blank">00:32:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">again.

And in particular, especially for convolutional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1992" target="_blank">00:33:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">neural networks for computer vision, we have, of course, a subsequent application of layers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=1998" target="_blank">00:33:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of convolutions. And our goal with feature visualization is to understand what each of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2003" target="_blank">00:33:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">these layers or what each of the neurons that are making up these layers, what kind of features</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2009" target="_blank">00:33:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">from the input did they learn that contribute to the final prediction. So we want to understand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2014" target="_blank">00:33:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">for example, imagine that you have a food classifier and you have many layers in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2018" target="_blank">00:33:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">convolutional neural network. Each layer will be looking at a particular kind of feature</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2024" target="_blank">00:33:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in the input that will contribute to the final output for the final classification. Some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2029" target="_blank">00:33:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">layers may look at, for example, lines. Some layers may be looking at edges. Some layers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2036" target="_blank">00:33:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">may be looking at certain patterns, etc. So we want to understand what features each of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2043" target="_blank">00:34:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">these layers or each of these neurons have learned. And we can do feature visualization</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2048" target="_blank">00:34:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">at many levels. We can do it at the neuron level. So what features is this neuron looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2053" target="_blank">00:34:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">at? Or we can do it at the layer level. So what kind of features is the particular layer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2059" target="_blank">00:34:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">looking at? And also at the logic level, in this case, we have a classification network.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2066" target="_blank">00:34:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So we want to understand what kind of features the model wants to see in order to predict</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2073" target="_blank">00:34:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it at that particular class.

And it's actually how it's done in practice. And it's actually also how more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2086" target="_blank">00:34:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">or less the Leap Labs Interpretable Engine works. Of course, it's much more sophisticated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2091" target="_blank">00:34:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a simplified explanation. But I wanted you to understand how such an engine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2096" target="_blank">00:34:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">works so that when you use it, you also know what's happening inside. So what we do, imagine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2103" target="_blank">00:35:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that you have a classification network, a convolutional network that is used for classification.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2107" target="_blank">00:35:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So as you can see here at the end, we have a Softmax and we have subsequent layers of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2111" target="_blank">00:35:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">convolutions. We want to understand what this layer of convolution has learned. So in order</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2120" target="_blank">00:35:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to understand what kind of features this layer has learned, we will treat it as an optimization</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2128" target="_blank">00:35:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">problem, which means that we will create an input that is a complete noise. We run it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2133" target="_blank">00:35:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">through our network. We take the activations of this layer. So all the outputs of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2141" target="_blank">00:35:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">layer and we use it as an objective function. Or you can also call it a loss function. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2146" target="_blank">00:35:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it's the same thing. So you take the output of this as loss and then you optimize the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">input to maximize this loss in this case. So that's why I'm calling it objective. Whenever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2157" target="_blank">00:35:57.260</a></span> | <span class="t">you are maximizing something, we call it objective function.

For example, when we train a model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2401" target="_blank">00:40:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we can do what is known as L1 regularization. With L1 regularization, what we do basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2407" target="_blank">00:40:07.780</a></span> | <span class="t">is we have our loss function, which is our, let's say, cross-entropy loss, because we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2415" target="_blank">00:40:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">are doing, for example, classification tasks. Then we can add some regularizer, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2421" target="_blank">00:40:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a constraint that we add to our loss function to make this optimization process happen in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2427" target="_blank">00:40:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">particular ways. For example, with L1 regularization, we want our models to use the least possible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2435" target="_blank">00:40:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">input features from the input. So what we do as a regularizer, we use the L1 regularization,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2442" target="_blank">00:40:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">which is basically just the absolute value of all the weights. What happens in this case?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2450" target="_blank">00:40:50.940</a></span> | <span class="t">What will happen is that because we calculate always the gradient of the loss function with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2456" target="_blank">00:40:56.500</a></span> | <span class="t">respect to the weights of the model, the presence of this absolute value on the weights or the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2463" target="_blank">00:41:03.620</a></span> | <span class="t">parameters will force these weights to become zero. And because the weights will become</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2469" target="_blank">00:41:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">zero, they will use less features from the input. And this helps to make the model more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2475" target="_blank">00:41:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">sparse, which also helps us to then reduce the size of the model. So regularizers are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2482" target="_blank">00:41:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">particular constraints that we add to the loss function to make this optimization process</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2487" target="_blank">00:41:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">happen in particular ways, to add some constraints to this optimization problem. And this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2495" target="_blank">00:41:35.060</a></span> | <span class="t">what we can also do in our optimization problem. So what are we optimizing? We are starting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2500" target="_blank">00:41:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">from pure noise. For example, this is our pure noise, and we want to transform into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2507" target="_blank">00:41:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">some kind of input that maximizes a particular output logic in our classification network.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2516" target="_blank">00:41:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course, when we train a neural network, the data set that the network was trained</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2522" target="_blank">00:42:02.540</a></span> | <span class="t">upon, let's say that in the space is here, but this does not mean that the model will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2528" target="_blank">00:42:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">not activate the output logic, for example, corresponding to the class dog for something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2534" target="_blank">00:42:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that is out of distribution. So what we want to do is we want our neural network to optimize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2541" target="_blank">00:42:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">our input noise. Sorry, we want our optimization problem to optimize our input noise in such</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2548" target="_blank">00:42:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a way that we remain close to the distribution of the data that the network has seen. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2554" target="_blank">00:42:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the natural input that the network has seen. How to do that? Well, first of all, look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2560" target="_blank">00:42:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">my picture. Do you think it's a noisy picture? No, because if you look at my t-shirt, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2566" target="_blank">00:42:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">can see that adjacent pixels, they are similar, and there is not much variance in the pixel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2574" target="_blank">00:42:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for neighboring pixels. So we could ask our optimization problem to optimize the input</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2580" target="_blank">00:43:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in such a way that it penalizes high variance for neighboring pixels. And this is known</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2588" target="_blank">00:43:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">as a frequency penalization. So we take our loss function, which is basically just the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2594" target="_blank">00:43:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">logic that we want to maximize, and we add a penalty to this loss. Every time we see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2600" target="_blank">00:43:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a very high variance for neighboring pixels. Another regularizer that we can use is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2606" target="_blank">00:43:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">transformation robustness. This is not applied to the loss, actually. This basically means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2612" target="_blank">00:43:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that we take our input, the one that we are optimizing, we transform it some way so we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2618" target="_blank">00:43:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">can rotate it, we can scale it, we can translate it.

Of course, there are many more regularizers that we need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2697" target="_blank">00:44:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to add to make this transformation, to make this optimization problem more robust so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2705" target="_blank">00:45:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we don't get some out of distribution data, but we want to try to generate data that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2710" target="_blank">00:45:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">as in distribution as possible.

So for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2740" target="_blank">00:45:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">example, you can see here, random transformation, so that the optimization process produces</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2747" target="_blank">00:45:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">an input that is as natural as possible without ever actually seeing an input.

It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2773" target="_blank">00:46:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">can generate very natural inputs.

Now let's try to use the knowledge that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2799" target="_blank">00:46:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we have acquired and apply it to language models. So as we saw before, with computer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2805" target="_blank">00:46:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">vision models, we can do prototype generation, which is based on feature visualization, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2809" target="_blank">00:46:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">means that given a particular, for example, output logit, we want to understand what kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2814" target="_blank">00:46:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of input the models want to see to have that particular logit as output. Can we apply the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2821" target="_blank">00:47:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">same techniques also to language models? So given a desired output, what kind of prompt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2826" target="_blank">00:47:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the model wants to see to generate that output? Well, let's try to answer that question. First,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2832" target="_blank">00:47:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">let's review how language models work. So a language model, as you know, is a probabilistic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2837" target="_blank">00:47:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">model that assigns probabilities to sequence of tokens. For example, imagine that the input</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2843" target="_blank">00:47:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to the language model is that Shanghai is a city in China. The model will tell us what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2849" target="_blank">00:47:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is the probability of the next token being China or being Beijing or being cat or being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2854" target="_blank">00:47:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">pizza or being whatever token is present in our vocabulary. One simplification I always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2859" target="_blank">00:47:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">do in my video is to associate a token with a word and the word with a token. But this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2864" target="_blank">00:47:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is not usually the case. So usually a word may not be a token and the token may not be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2870" target="_blank">00:47:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">a word. And actually, most of the cases, a word is actually made up of multiple tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2876" target="_blank">00:47:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But for our case, we will simplify it and see that every token is a word and every word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2880" target="_blank">00:48:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">is a token. So the language model just tell us what is the probability of the next token</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2885" target="_blank">00:48:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">given an input prompt. Imagine we want to understand what our model thinks of the word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2893" target="_blank">00:48:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">girl. So what kind of input, what kind of prompt the model wants to see as input to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2902" target="_blank">00:48:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">predict the word girl as next token? Well, let's try to use the techniques that we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2909" target="_blank">00:48:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">seen before. So first, let's see the results of such an analysis. And in particular, Jessica,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2916" target="_blank">00:48:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">who is the founder of LeapLabs, she did this study. So she took some tokens, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2922" target="_blank">00:48:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the word girl, and then she optimized the input prompt in such a way that the output</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2928" target="_blank">00:48:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">girl is maximized. So the next predicted token is a girl given this input. And she did it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2936" target="_blank">00:48:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">also for the word woman. She did it for the word good and for the word doctor. This gives</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2942" target="_blank">00:49:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">us insight into what our model has learned because our model, our language model is just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2947" target="_blank">00:49:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">a model that models the statistical distributions of tokens based on the training data it has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2953" target="_blank">00:49:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">seen. So in this case, for example, the prompt that maximizes the word girl as being the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2961" target="_blank">00:49:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">next token is this input here. And as you can see, it tells us that our model has seen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2968" target="_blank">00:49:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of bad data that is making our model have bias against girls, for example, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2977" target="_blank">00:49:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we see sexual words, we see other girls that are not quite polite. And the same happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2983" target="_blank">00:49:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">for, well, in the case of the woman, the word woman, it's a little better, but still it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2989" target="_blank">00:49:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">tells you what are the bias of your model against this particular concept. And we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=2994" target="_blank">00:49:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">see it also for the word good, for example, we see that shooting is good or somehow, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3000" target="_blank">00:50:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus and beautiful or basketball, et cetera. So optimizing the prompt to generate a particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3009" target="_blank">00:50:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">output tells you what our model wants to see as input to generate that particular output,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3015" target="_blank">00:50:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">which gives us insights into the distribution that our model has learned. And Jessica, she</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3021" target="_blank">00:50:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">ran another experiment, which is to, because when we optimize the prompt, we will see later</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3026" target="_blank">00:50:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">how it's actually done in practice. We start from complete noise and we optimize this prompt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3032" target="_blank">00:50:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to, to, to become tokens that are more likely to predict a particular output. And of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3042" target="_blank">00:50:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">you can restart this optimization problem from multiple starting points, because you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3046" target="_blank">00:50:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">can start from complete noise and you have many starting points. So many input noises</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3052" target="_blank">00:50:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you can have as starting point. And she did it many times and she got some input tokens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3057" target="_blank">00:50:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that were more likely to predict the word girl as next token. This gives us a map on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3063" target="_blank">00:51:03.900</a></span> | <span class="t">what kind of inputs the model wants to see with each of tokens with its frequency, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3071" target="_blank">00:51:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of inputs the model wants to see to predict the girl as next token or boy as next token</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3076" target="_blank">00:51:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">or science or art as next token. And this also gives us insight into the statistical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3081" target="_blank">00:51:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">distribution that our model has learned. For example, the word girl, to get the word girl</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3086" target="_blank">00:51:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">as output, the model wants to see some sexual words and some other like not so, some curse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3094" target="_blank">00:51:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">words also, but also for example, the word dresses or the word boys. And in the case</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3099" target="_blank">00:51:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">of the word boy, we can see that it wants to see rebellious, monkey, girl, et cetera,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3105" target="_blank">00:51:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">et cetera, but this gives us insight into what our model has seen during its training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3111" target="_blank">00:51:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So now let's try to analyze how to actually generate this kind of map and how this optimization</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3117" target="_blank">00:51:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">problem works. What we did before with the computer vision models, that is we have some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3124" target="_blank">00:52:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">output logits for which we want to find an input that maximizes that logit is exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3129" target="_blank">00:52:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what we want to do here, except that here we have a language model and we have another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3135" target="_blank">00:52:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">complexity. So let's do it step-by-step, how we can generate this kind of map. Imagine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3142" target="_blank">00:52:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">that we want to find input embeddings that maximize the probability of the next token</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3149" target="_blank">00:52:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">being girl. Now, the first complexity is that girl may not be one token, but it could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3155" target="_blank">00:52:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple tokens. So let's suppose that it's actually multiple tokens because this is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3160" target="_blank">00:52:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">real scenario. So we have the output that we want to optimize an input for, and suppose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3166" target="_blank">00:52:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that we want to optimize three input embeddings. So let's draw three input embeddings to maximize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3174" target="_blank">00:52:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the probability of the next token being girl, but we know that girl may not be a single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3180" target="_blank">00:53:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">token. So let's suppose that it's actually two tokens. So one token, it's GI and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3186" target="_blank">00:53:06.780</a></span> | <span class="t">other token being RL. Now the job that we did before, that is calculating the loss of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3196" target="_blank">00:53:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the output with respect to the input. It's something that we cannot do anymore. Why?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3202" target="_blank">00:53:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the input in the language model is tokens and tokens are numbers that represent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3208" target="_blank">00:53:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the position of this token in the vocabulary. So for example, imagine the input could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3214" target="_blank">00:53:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">for example, zero, five, and nine, and these are positions that represent each token in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3220" target="_blank">00:53:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the vocabulary. And we cannot optimize for something that is discrete because there is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3225" target="_blank">00:53:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">no token 0.5, there is no token 3.2. We cannot change these tokens a little bit, hoping that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3232" target="_blank">00:53:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">they move towards something that represents, that will generate that kind of output. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3237" target="_blank">00:53:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">only thing that we can optimize are embeddings. So we will not be optimizing input tokens,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3243" target="_blank">00:54:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we will be optimizing input embeddings. So in this case, we suppose that we have three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3248" target="_blank">00:54:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">embeddings. So let me delete this part. So we suppose that we have three input embeddings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3269" target="_blank">00:54:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Now which three input embeddings should we choose? Well, in the case of the computer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3273" target="_blank">00:54:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">vision model, we started from pure noise. In this case, we can also start from pure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3277" target="_blank">00:54:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">noise. So we can start from three random embeddings. One, two, and three. What we can do, we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3287" target="_blank">00:54:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">run these three embeddings in our language model. And as you know, the language model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3291" target="_blank">00:54:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is a transformable model in most of the cases, and it's a sequence to sequence model that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3295" target="_blank">00:54:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">will generate if the input is three embeddings, it will generate three embeddings as output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3300" target="_blank">00:55:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So here, we will have three embeddings. Our goal is to make sure to select three embeddings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3312" target="_blank">00:55:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that make the likelihood of the next token being GI and the next next token being RL</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3320" target="_blank">00:55:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">maximized. So how to proceed? We take these three embeddings, we run it through our model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3326" target="_blank">00:55:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">it will produce three embeddings as output. Usually when sampling from a language model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3331" target="_blank">00:55:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">we take the last embedding, so the last hidden state, so the output of a language model here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3338" target="_blank">00:55:38.220</a></span> | <span class="t">at this point are called hidden states. We take the last hidden state, we send it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3344" target="_blank">00:55:44.060</a></span> | <span class="t">the linear layer, and it will generate what are known as logits. Logits indicate what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3350" target="_blank">00:55:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">is the probability score, it's not a probability actually, but what is the score that the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3354" target="_blank">00:55:54.900</a></span> | <span class="t">assigns to each token in the vocabulary, and then by applying the softmax, they become</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3360" target="_blank">00:56:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">probability scores, and then usually we choose the token with the maximum probability score</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3365" target="_blank">00:56:05.940</a></span> | <span class="t">as the next token. So in this case, we can take the last embedding, we can run it through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3375" target="_blank">00:56:15.780</a></span> | <span class="t">the linear layer, and it will generate logits. So we will have the logits associated with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3381" target="_blank">00:56:21.100</a></span> | <span class="t">the position, let's say zero. In this logits, we are concerned, because it's a list of numbers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3388" target="_blank">00:56:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">each one for each position in the vocabulary, we are interested in two logits in particular.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3394" target="_blank">00:56:34.220</a></span> | <span class="t">One is the one with the highest probability score, and that will be used to sample the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3400" target="_blank">00:56:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">next token, and one is the logit corresponding to the token GI. So we save two logits, one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3407" target="_blank">00:56:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">is corresponding to the GI, and one is for the next token. We use the logit corresponding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3415" target="_blank">00:56:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">to the next token to understand what is the next token, we put it back in the input of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3419" target="_blank">00:56:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">the model, so we put back the embedding corresponding to this next token in the input of the model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3427" target="_blank">00:57:07.020</a></span> | <span class="t">along with the three input tokens that we saw before. This will result in four output</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3431" target="_blank">00:57:11.860</a></span> | <span class="t">embeddings being generated.

Then we take these two logits,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3451" target="_blank">00:57:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">we know their probability score, because we can run the softmax, and we use them as objective</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3458" target="_blank">00:57:38.020</a></span> | <span class="t">for our optimization process, because we want to maximize these probabilities. So the probability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg1-M8hEX50&t=3464" target="_blank">00:57:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">of selecting this token, and this token.
