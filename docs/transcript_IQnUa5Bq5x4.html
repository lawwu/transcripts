And I would just lay there like the snow angel and just kind of let my thoughts sort of pass through my brain. And this is when I personally have the feeling that I'm a part of it. I belong here rather than feeling kind of small. Yes, I'm small, but there are many other small things and lots of small things make one big difference. It's just that I'm not a big fan of the small. The following is a conversation with Anna Farbell, an astrophysicist at MIT, studying the oldest stars in the Milky Way galaxy in order to understand the chemical and physical conditions of the early universe and how from that our galaxy formed and evolved to what it is today, the place we humans call home. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Anna Farbell. Let's go back to the early days. What did the formation of the Milky Way galaxy look like? Or maybe we want to start even before that. What did the formation of the universe look like? Well, we scientists believe there was the Big Bang, some big beginning. But what is important for my work, and I think that's what we're going to talk about, is what kind of elements were present at that time. So the Big Bang left a universe behind that was made of just hydrogen and helium and tiny little sprinkles of lithium. And that was pretty much it. As it turns out, it's actually quite hard to make stars or any structure from that. That's fairly hot gas. And so the very first stars that formed prior to any galaxies were very massive stars, big stars. 100 times the mass. And they were made from just hydrogen and helium. So big stars explode pretty fast after a few million years only. That's very short on cosmic time scales. And in their explosions, they provided the first heavier elements to the universe because in their cores, all stars fuse lighter elements like hydrogen and helium into heavier ones. And then that goes all the way up to iron and then all that material gets ejected in these massive supermassive. And that's what we call the Big Bang. And it's a really, really important transition in the universe because after that first explosion, it was no longer chemically pristine. And that set the stage for everything else to happen, including us here talking today. So what do you mean by pristine? So there's a whole complex soup of elements now as opposed to just hydrogen, helium and a little bit of lithium. Yeah. So after the Big Bang, just hydrogen and helium. We don't really need to talk too much about lithium because the amount was so small. And after these very first stars formed and exploded, heavier elements like carbon, oxygen, magnesium, iron, all of that stuff was suddenly present in the gas clouds. Tiny amounts only, very tiny amounts. But that actually helped. And that's what we're talking about. And that's why we're talking about the big bang. And that's why we're talking about the big bang.

And that's almost a little bit sad, but that's really not the case, right? Because there's so much more, and I really like to imagine, wow, I'm sitting in this big galactic merry-go-round, and we're going around the center, and I can see the center above me, right? And I can almost feel like we're going there. Of course, we can't really feel that, but the Sun does circle the galactic center. But there's a kind of sadness to looking pictures of a nice vacation place. All we get is that light, an old light. Do you feel sad that we don't get to travel, or you and I will not get to travel there, and maybe humans will never get to travel there? Yeah, I always wanted to travel into space and see the Earth and other things from up there. They're certainly that, but I don't know. It's also okay to just be at our vantage point and see it from here. With the sensors, with the telescopes that we have, and explore the possibility. Yeah. I mean, there is a kind of wonder to the mystery of it all, what's out there, what interesting things that we can't possibly imagine. There could be all kinds of life forms, bacteria, all this kind of stuff. I tend to believe that, it depends on the day, I tend to believe there's just a lot of very primitive organisms just spread out throughout, and they build their little things like bacteria-type organisms. Just to think what kind of worlds there are, because they're probably really creative living organisms. Because the conditions, I guess the question I'm wondering to myself when I look out there to the stars, how different are the conditions on the different planets that orbit those stars? It will definitely be very different. I mean, the variety out there is huge. We know now that, I think, it's about... Yeah. Every other star has at least one planet. I already mentioned the number of stars in the galaxy. I mean, it's a huge number of planets out there. So who knows what that looks like? All we know is that there is a lot of variety. We don't quite yet understand what drives that, what governs that, why that is the case, why is it not all one size fits all. You mean the dynamics of planets? Planet formation, exoplanet formation, or star formation, the whole... All of it. All of it. Star formation remains a much-researched topic. We definitely know that it works. Because all the stars are there. Same for the planets. But the details are so varied, per gas cloud, right? It's very hard to come up with very detailed prescriptions. Broadly, we have figured it out. You need a gas cloud. You need to cool it. Something clumps and fragments, and somehow it makes a star with planets or without. But the dynamics of the clumping process is not fully understood. No, no. And the local conditions are so varied, right? I mean, it's the same with... All people look like people, but individually, we look very different. So even the subtle diversity of the formation process creates all kinds of fun differences. Yes. So we just don't know how this turned out in an individual case. And it's kind of hard to figure it all out and to take a look, certainly with planets, right? The chance to ever actually take a picture of a planet is minuscule because they don't shine. So they're really dark. So I'd say there's a lot of possibility out there, but we have to be a little bit more patient before we... Or come up with technologies where patience becomes less necessary. Yes. By extending our lifetimes or increasing the speed of space travel, all that kind of stuff. Humans are pretty intelligent. They're pretty... Sometimes, yeah. For the most part, I hope, on the optimistic days. Well, maybe just to linger on what a galaxy is, what should we know about our understanding of black holes in the formation? Is that an important thing to understand in the formation of a galaxy? Yeah. Yeah. So all the orbiting, all the spiraling that's going on, how important is that to understand? All of the above. That's what makes astronomy really hard, but also really interesting, right? No day is like another because we always find something new. I want to come back to the idea of the proto-galaxy because it actually matches or relates to the black hole formation. So most large... Well, pretty much all large galaxies have a supermassive black hole in the center. And we don't actually know how to do that. We don't really know where they come from. Again, we know that they are there, but how do we get there? So we go back to the early universe, right? We had a little galaxy that just sort of, I don't know, had some small number of stars. It was the first gravitationally bound structure that was held together by dark matter because dark matter actually kind of structured up first before the luminous matter could. Because that's what dark matter kind of does. And it started to hold gas and then stars sort of together in these first very shallow, what we call potential wells. So these gravitationally bound systems. And then the Milky Way grew from absorbing neighboring smaller, even smaller systems. And somewhere in that process, there must have been a seed for one of these supermassive black holes. And I'm not actually sure that it's clear right now, kind of what was there first, the supermassive black hole or the galaxy. So lots of people are trying to study that. And of course, the black hole wasn't as massive back then as it is these days. But it's a big area of research. And the new James Webb JWST, the infrared telescope in space, many people are working on that to figure out exactly what happened. And there are some surprising results that we really don't understand right now. So to solve the chicken or the egg problem of, do you need the supermassive black hole to form a galaxy? Or does the galaxy naturally create the supermassive black hole? Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think to some degree, we can answer that because there are lots of little dwarf galaxies out there. The Milky Way remains surrounded by many, does it? Dozens of small dwarf galaxies. I have studied a bunch of them. And to the extent that we can tell, they do not contain black holes. So there certainly were gravitationally bound structures. So either you can call them proto-galaxies or dwarf galaxies or first galaxies. They were definitely there. But there must have been bigger things like the proto-Milky Way, where something was different, right? What made them more massive so that, you know, they would gravitationally attract these smaller systems to integrate them. So we'll have to see. How do we look into the dynamics of the formation and the evolution of the proto-galaxies? Is it possible? Do they shine? I mean, what are the set of data that we can possibly look at? So we've got gravitational waves, which is really insane that we can even detect those. There's light. Yeah. What else can we... So that would form a galaxy. Yeah. And that would fall into the category of observational cosmology. And the JWST is the prime telescope right now. And it promises big, big steps forward. This is in its early days because it's only been online like a year or so. But that collects the infrared light from the farthest, like literally proto-galaxies, earliest galaxies. That light has traveled some 13 billion years to us. And they're observing these faint little blobs. And folks are trying to, you know, again, study the early, the onset of these early supermassive black holes, how they shape galaxies. So they're seeing that they were there, you know, surrounded by already bigger galaxies. Ideally, I'd like for my colleagues to push a little bit further. Hopefully that will eventually happen. In terms of looking towards older and older ones. Yeah. Yeah. More and more sort of, more primitive in terms of the structure. But of course, as you can imagine, if you make your system smaller and smaller, it becomes dimmer and dimmer. And it's further and further away. So we're reaching the end of the line from a technical perspective pretty quickly. But it's dimmer and dimmer means older and older. Yes, in a sense, because it all started really small. Right. Because it's smaller and smaller, which correlates to older and older. In that phase of the universe, it would. Otherwise, it doesn't. Yeah. Just to take a small tangent about black holes. And, you know, because you do quite a bit of observational cosmology and maybe experimental astrophysics, what's the difference to you between theoretical physics and experimental? So there's a lot of really interesting explorations about paradoxes around black holes and all this kind of stuff about black holes destroying information. Yeah. Do they have any other questions? Yeah. Do those worlds intermix to you when you, especially when you step away from your work and kind of think about the mystery of it all? Well, at first glance, there isn't actually much crosstalk. Personally, I mostly observe stars, so I don't usually actually think too much of black holes, about black holes. And stars is a fundamentally kind of chemical physical phenomena that doesn't... That's right. The physics is kind of different. It's not extreme. Yeah. I mean, you know, you could consider a nuclear fusion sort of be perhaps extreme. You need to tunnel. There's some interesting physics there. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty fun. But it's just a different flavor. And I don't do these kinds of calculations myself either. I very much like to talk with my theory colleagues about these things though, because I find there's always an interesting intersection. And often it's just... I've written a number of... Yeah. ...papers with colleagues who do simulations about galaxies. And so they're not quite as far removed as, let's say, the black hole pen and paper folks. But even in those cases, we had the same interest in the same topics, but it was almost like we're speaking two different languages. And we weren't even that far removed, both astronomers and all. And it was really interesting just to take the time and really try to talk to each other. Yeah. And it's amazing how hard that is. Even amongst scientists, we already have trouble talking to each other. Imagine how hard it is to talk to non-scientists and other people to try to... We're all interested in the same things as humans at the end of the day, right? But everyone has a different angle about it and different questions and way of formulating things. And sometimes it really takes a while to... Yeah. ...to call it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's really interesting to see how we can all converge and to get to the common ground. But if you take the time, it's so interesting to participate in that process. And it feels so good in the end to say like, "Yes, we tackled this together." We overcame our differences, not so much in opinion, but just in expressing ourselves about this and how we go about solving a problem. And these were some of my most successful papers, and I certainly enjoyed them the most. It could also lead to big discoveries. I mean, there's a... I think... Yeah. I think you put it really well in saying that we're all kind of studying the same kind of mysteries and problems. I mean, I see this in the space of artificial intelligence. You have a community maybe, it seems very far away, artificial intelligence and neuroscience. You would think that they're studying very different things, but one is trying to engineer intelligence and in so doing, try to understand intelligence. And the other is trying to understand intelligence and cognition in the human mind. And they're just doing it from a different set of data. Different set of backgrounds and the researchers that do that kind of work. And probably the same is true in observational cosmology and simulation. So it's like a fundamentally different approach to understanding the universe. Let me use... For simulation, let me use the things I know to create a bunch of parameters and create some... Just play with it. Play with the universe. Play God. Create a bunch of universe. And see in a way that matches experimental data. It's a fun... It's like playing Sims, but at the cosmic level. Yes, yes. But then probably the set of terminology used there is very different. And maybe you're allowed to break the rules a little bit more. Let's have... Yeah, it's like the Drake equation. Yeah, you don't really know. You kind of come up with a bunch of values here and there and just see how it evolves. And from that, kind of intuit the different possibilities, the dynamics of the evolution of a galaxy. Yeah. Galaxy, for example. Yeah, but it's cool to play between those two. Because it seems like we understand so little about our cosmos. So it's good to play. Yes. It's like a big sandbox, right? And everyone kind of has their little corner and they do things, but we're all in the same sandbox together at the end of the day. But that sandbox does have super powerful and super expensive telescopes that everybody's also... All the children are fighting for the resources to make sure they get to ask the right questions using that big, cool tool. Can we actually step back on the big field of stellar archaeology? What is this process? Can you just speak to it again? You've been speaking to it. What is this process of archaeology in the cosmos? Yeah, it's really fascinating. So I mentioned the lesser the mass of the star, the longer it lives. Yes. And again, for reference, for the next dinner party, the sun's lifetime is 10 billion years. So if you have a star that's 0.6 or 0.8 solar masses, then its lifetime is going to be 15 to 20 billion years. And that's an important range for our conversation. Because again, if you assume that such a small star formed soon after the Big Bang, then it is still observable today. You mentioned old light before. Yeah, that light is like a few thousand years old, but compared to the age of the star, it's still observable today. Yeah, that's right. And the age of these stars is nothing. So to me, that's young. It comes straight from our galaxy. These stars are not far away. They're in our galaxy in the outskirts. They probably did not form in the galaxy because, again, hierarchical assembly of a Milky Way meant… They were even. Exactly. They formed in a little other galaxy in the vicinity, and at some point, the Milky Way ate them. They ate that, which means it absorbed all the stars, including these little old stars that are now in the outskirts of the Milky Way that I used to point my telescope to. So what can we learn from these stars? Why should we study them? Now, these little stars are really, really efficient with their energy consumption. They are still burning, for the experts, just burning hydrogen to helium in their cores, and they have done so for the past 12, 13 billion years, however old they are. So we want to keep doing that for another few billion years, same as the Sun. The Sun also just does hydrogen to helium burning and will continue that for a while, which means the outer parts of the star, well, pretty much actually most of the star, that gas doesn't talk to the core. So whatever composition that star has in its outer layers is exactly the same as the gas composition that the star has in its outer layers. So whatever composition that star has in its outer layers is exactly the same as the gas composition that the star has in its outer layers. So whatever composition that star has in its outer layers is exactly the same as the gas composition that the star has in its outer layers. So whatever composition that star has in its outer layers is exactly the same as the gas composition that the star has in its outer layers. So whatever composition that star has in its outer layers is exactly the same as the gas composition that the star has in its outer layers. So whatever composition that star has in its outer layers is exactly the same as the gas composition that the star has in its outer layers. So whatever composition that star has in its outer layers is exactly the same as the gas composition that the star has in its outer layers. So whatever composition that star has in its outer layers is exactly the same as the gas composition that the star has in its outer layers. So whatever composition that star has in its outer layers is exactly the same as the gas composition that the star has in its outer layers. not accurately date these stars but we use a trick to say oh these stars must have formed as some of the earliest generations of stars because we need to talk about the chemical evolution of the universe and the Milky Way for a second so already mentioned the the pristineness of the universe after the Big Bang right just hydrogen and helium then the first stars formed they produced a sprinkle of heavier elements up to iron then the next generation of stars formed that included again massive stars that they would explode again but also the little ones that keep on living right so and then the massive ones again explode as supernova so they provide again another sprinkle of heavier elements and so over time all the elements in the periodic table have been built up there have been other processes for example the supernovae have been built up and then the other processes for example neutron star mergers and other exotic supernovae that have provided elements heavier than iron all the way up to uranium from very early on we're still trying to figure out those details but I always say pretty much all the elements were done from like day three so iron is where like once you get to iron you got all the fun you need most of the fun yes I know I I I really like the heavier elements you know gold silver platinum that kind of stuff for personal reasons or for star formation well both I mean like what's the importance of these heavier metals in uh in the evolution of the stars so they have they're the spice of life right so every supernova gives you elements up to iron that's cool but at some point it gets a little bit boring because that always works but that's the baseline we need that um and that's certainly what came out of the first stars and then all the other supernova explosions that you know followed with every generation and it took about a thousand Generations give or take until the sun was made so the sun formed from a gas cloud that was enriched by roughly thousand Generations of supernova explosions and that's why the sun has its its chemical the chemical composition that it has including you know and somehow the planets were were made from that as well so the supernova explosions the many Generations are creating more and more complex elements no it just goes all the way up to iron yeah and then it just it's a little bit more of of all of these elements just more yeah just yeah it's one sprinkle then another and it just kind of adds up right now the heavy elements form in very different ways they are not Fusion made they are made typically through neutron capture processes but for that you need seed nuclei ideally you know iron or carbon or something so the supernova made elements are a very good seed nuclear for other processes that then create heavy elements and because they cannot be made everywhere they when you when you know so I my some of my stars have huge amounts of these heavy elements in them and they tell us in much more detail something really interesting happened somewhere well wait I thought I thought the really old ones we would not have so what does that mean if if the old ah yes important clarification um so the stars that we are observing today these old ones they formed from the gas and the question is what enriched that gas so it could have been just a first star dumping their elements into that gas all the way up to iron and we have found some stars that we think are second generation stars so they form from gas and rich by just one first star that's super cool yeah then we find other old stars that have a much more complicated um heavy element signature and that means okay they're probably formed in a gas cloud that had a few things going on such as maybe a first star maybe another more normal supernova and maybe some kind of special process like a neutral process or something like that so that's star merger that would make heavy elements. They created a local chemical signature from which the next generation star then formed, and that is what we're observing today. So all these old stars basically carry the signature from all these progenitor events, and it's our job then to unravel which processes and which events and how many may have occurred in the early universe that led to exactly that signature that we observe 13 billion years later. Is it possible to figure out the number of generations that resulted in these stars? Well, we think we can say this was like second generation or third, because the amounts of heavy elements in the stars that we observe is so tiny. It's not like we can say, "Okay, this is the second generation or third," because the amounts of heavy elements in the stars that we observe is so tiny, one normal supernova explosion is actually already basically too much. It would give us too much of it. And the thing is, you can never take away things in the universe. You can only add. There's no cosmic vacuum cleaner going around sucking things away. The black holes are probably the closest to that, but they would have taken the whole star. Yeah, they'd take the whole thing, not just a little bit. They wouldn't have taken stuff out of the gas, you know. So we have maybe 10 stars or so now where we're saying that they contain so little of these heavy elements that there must be second generation, because how else would you have made them? And again, I want to stress that the elements that we observe in these stars were not made by the stars themselves that we observe. That's just a reflection of the gas cloud. So we don't actually, I hate to say that, because I love stars. At the end of the day, we don't really care for the stars that we're observing. We care for the story that they're telling us about the early universe. Yeah, so the stars are kind of a small mirror into the early universe. And so what are you detecting about those stars? Can you tell me about the process of archaeology here? What kind of data can we possibly get to tell the story about these heavy elements on the stars? Yeah, it depends really on what stars we're observing. So we can actually see the star you find. There are many different chemical signatures. We actually pair up these days our element signatures with also kinematic information, how the star moves about the galaxy. That actually gives us clues as to where the star might have come from. Because again, all these old stars are in the galaxy, but they are not off the galaxy. That's a small but important distinction. So they all came from somewhere else. So you can rewind back in time to kind of estimate where it came from? Yeah, so we can't really say, "Oh, it came from that dwarf galaxy." But interestingly enough, a few days ago, I submitted a paper with three women undergrads. It was so good to work together. And we found a sample of stars that have very, very low abundances in strontium and barium, so very heavy elements. And I had a hunch for a while that these stars would probably be some of the oldest. Because as I said, heavy elements give you extra information about special events. And again, finding something that's really low means that must have happened either really early on or in a very special environment, right? Because we can only ever add. So if you find something that's incredibly low in terms of the abundance, maybe just one event, it's not a big deal. But if you find something that's incredibly low in terms of events, you can add it to the list. And if you find something that's incredibly high in terms of events, you can add it to the list. But if you find something that's incredibly low in terms of events, you can add it to the list. But if you find something that's incredibly low in terms of events, you can add it to the list. But if you find something that's incredibly low in terms of we looked at the kinematics, how are these stars moving? And they're all going the wrong way in the galaxy. How is that possible? Well, it is possible because consider, now we come back to the proto-galaxy. The proto-galaxy was like a beehive. It just didn't really know what it was or what it wanted to become when it grew up. And it was absorbing all these little galaxies to grow fast. And some galaxies, some absorbed galaxies were thrown in going the main way, and some came in the wrong way. It happens. Yeah, it happens. But this could only happen early on when there wasn't left and right and up and down. So stuff would come in from all ways. So now, 13 billion years later, we're looking- They're still doing it. Yeah, A, they're still doing it. And B, we just looked for stars that have low strontium and barium abundances, and then we look at the kinematics, and lo and behold, they're all at hundreds of kilometers per second going the wrong way. It's like, dude, you must have come in really early on from somewhere else. So we call this retrograde motion. That's a clear sign of accretion, so something that has come into the galaxy. And because they are so fast, and it's really all of them, that must have happened early on. You can't throw a galaxy into the Mickey right now the wrong way. It eventually will turn around. Can you actually just on a small tangent speak to the three women undergrads? It's pretty cool that you were able to use a hunch to find this really cool little star. What's the process like, especially with undergrads? I think that would be very interesting and inspiring to people. Yes, it was a wonderful little collaboration that actually emerged in the fall. I really like working with undergrads and grad students, postdocs. And I came up with a new concept for a class at MIT where I wanted to integrate the research process into the classroom. Because sometimes people find it really hard to call, email a professor, "Hey, I'm this and that person, and I'm interested in your research. Could I possibly come?" Yes. And I wanted to streamline that and give an in-details trial how it would work to provide sort of the safe confines of a classroom where you just sign up and do research in a very structured way. And I developed it. It was a lot of work, a little bit more than I thought, to map up an entire research project basically from scratch in 10 worksheets so that they could do it. And I was able to do it in a very structured and organized fashion. So you created this whole framework for them to do it. Yes, the whole thing. But the promise was, you come sign up for my class. In Teens of Two, you each get your own old star that has not been analyzed before. I don't know what the solution is, because in research, we don't look up the solution at the end of the book. We do not know what we're going to find. Our job is to do the work and then to interpret the numbers, because our job as scientists is to find the story. Anyone can crunch numbers. Anyone. It's complicated sometimes, but it's doable, right? But coming up with a story when you only have three puzzle pieces, what does the puzzle look like? You have to be a little bit bold. You need to have some experience and you need to kind of see the universe in 3D. You just need to kind of go for it. And that's the beautiful thing. I really love that. And so this was a story of weird kinematics going the wrong way, combined with this particular weird signature in terms of the heavy elements. Exactly. And you have to come up with a story. Yes. And so the story of that paper is now, usually I don't say I find the oldest stars. When I talk to my research colleagues, I talk to them about, we find the chemically most pristine stars, because that's actually what we measure, the chemical abundance that tells us, okay, it must have been second nature. It must have been the chemical abundance. It must have been the second or third or fifth generation of stars, right? But these low strontium stars that go in the wrong way, like they're getting paid for it, they must be the oldest stars that came into the galaxy because they formed before the galaxy was the Milky Way, right? And it's so cool. And it was so wonderful. So this class, it went so well in the fall. I had nine people sign up. That's not unusual for a specialty class at MET. So small number. It was eight women and they were so into it that I said, okay, let's use this opportunity. You're going to do some extra work with me and we're going to publish this. Try to publish. Yes. I also like that you're using the terminology of chemically more pristine. When I'm talking to younger people, I'll just say that I'm more chemically pristine than them. I like that description of age. So there's this term of metal-poured stars. So most of these old stars are going to be metal-pour. Yes. I search for the most metal-pour stars. And what does that, can we just define that? Yeah, what does it mean? I don't know who came up with this. I would love to know, but the universe is a complicated place. So many decades ago, someone clever came up with the idea to say, let's simplify things a little bit. Let's call hydrogen X, helium Y, and all the other elements combined, metals Z. Okay. Okay. When I give public talks, I always ask, is there a chemist in the audience? Let me just tell you, neon is a wonderful metal. And they're like, oh my God, what's he saying? But I'm an astronomer. I'm not a chemist, so I'll get away with it. So if you just roll with it for a moment, all the elements except hydrogen and helium are called metals. Now, if we look again at chemical or the concept of chemical, chemical evolution, it means more and more of all the elements, everything heavier than hydrogen and helium gets produced slowly but surely by different types of stores and events. So that's a monotonously increasing function. And so we look for the stars that have the least amounts of heavy elements in them, because that means we are going further and further back in this process, in that function, almost all the way to the very beginning. And that is the first stars, right? They started that process. That's why I said it was such an important transition phase, because we call the post-Big Bang universe pristine, just hydrogen and helium. And after that, the mess started. As soon as you add elements to it, things kind of get a little out of hand. That ends in this beautiful variety that we have everywhere these days. And you're looking at the very early days in the introduction of the variety. Yes, exactly. When it was still a little bit more organizable. But the variety of different types of metal pore stars we have is stark. Many different types of stars, many patterns we have sort of identified, but there are still crazy ones out there that we're still trying to kind of fit in. So what kind of stars have been discovered? So you've already a while ago helped discover the star HE 13272326. Great name. Yes. And HE 15230901. What can you say about these stars and others that have been found? I love them. They're my baby stars. What do you call your baby stars? Well, I'm probably the only one who can spit out these names without cheating. Are there nicknames? Are there nicknames? Well, no. That's... That's... That's not allowed? Okay. Well, some colleagues at conferences have just called them Anna star or Freebell star because they didn't want to learn the phone number. I get it. Phone number. Yeah. These numbers are actually based on older sets of coordinates for these stars. So the minus in the middle means that they're in the Southern hemisphere. So negative is in the Southern hemisphere, positive is in the Northern. And then 13 and 15 means they're sort of observable in the middle of the year. Okay. So that's to do with the observable. Yeah. So that's to do with the observable. And then the observation and where it was observed and that kind of stuff. Yes. Yes. Yes. But they have very different stars, both absolutely significant, career defining actually for me, but really pushed the envelope in very different ways. So HE 1327, the first one that you mentioned, that was the second, second generation star that we found. And, you know, usually people say like, oh, the first one is the big one and the rest is nobody cares. But, you know, it's a big one. And then the second one is the big one. And the rest is nobody cares. But, you know, it's a big one. And then the first one is the big one. And the rest is nobody cares. But, you know, it's a big one. And then the second one is the big one. And then the first one is the big one. And then the first one is the big one. And then the second one is the big one. And then the first one is the big one. But to us, it proved that, yes, we can do it. Because one, astronomers live in this sort of way of, you know, there are a lot of serendipitous discoveries and we, that's really great, but we need to show that we can do it again. Mm-hmm. Reliably. Because then we're onto something and it's not just some kind of weird quirk. And there are a lot of quirks in the universe, but we want to know, is that a real thing? Does that happen regularly? Mm-hmm. Is there something that we can learn? Is that a piece of the story? Mm-hmm. And so finding the second one that was even a little bit more extreme than the first one really showed, yes, our search techniques work. We can find these stars. They provide an important part to the story in the sense that if we had more than two stars, and by now we have about 10-ish or so, what do they tell us about the nature of the very first stars? And what we found, again, working with the theorists, of course, who run these supernova models, is that, so actually let me, before I get into this, these two stars had huge amounts of carbon relative to iron. So we usually use iron as a reference element for what we call the metallicity. So the overall metal content, the overall amount of heavy, heavy elements in it. Mm-hmm. So that's why it's called iron deficient stars. That's right. So these stars are incredibly iron deficient, which means they must be of the second generation because there was, and interestingly enough, there was this discrepancy. A normal supernovae, until then, we thought would get us so much iron, you know, and you would distribute that in the gas cloud, and then you would form this little star that we're observing. But the iron abundance that we measured was actually much lower than that. And I already mentioned, you can't take things away. That must mean these early massive POP3, we call them population three, the first stars, they must have exploded in a different way than we previously thought. They can't output as much iron because they just can't. Otherwise, it wouldn't match our observations. Got it. And so that's when we started to work with several theory groups on supernova yields. So what comes out of- From the explosion of the supernova? Yeah. That's cool. Supernova yields. And so this one was not yielding much iron. Well, we needed to concoct a theoretical supernova that made less. And it's actually surprisingly difficult because you can always add more in the universe, right? But you can't take stuff away. So our Japanese colleagues kind of came up with the idea of, "What if we take a bigger supernova, a bigger one, and we take a bigger one?" And they said, "Well, we can't take that much iron out of the universe." And so we started to work with a theory group that was working on that. And they said, "Well, we can't take that much iron out of the universe." And so we started to work with a theory group that was working on that. And they said, "Well, we can't take that much iron out of the universe." And so we started to work with a theory group that was working on that. And they said, "Well, we can't take that much iron out of the universe." And so we started to work with a theory group that was working on that. And so we started to work with a theory group that was working on that. And so we started to work with a theory group that was working on that. And because we didn't have just one star, but two, that really spurred the field to think about, what was the nature of the first stars? How did they explode? What are the implications? Because if they are not as luminous and bright and energetic, that has consequences for these early proto-galaxies in which they must have been located in terms of blowing the gas out, let's say, and disrupting the system. So much higher chance for the earlier system to stay intact for longer, right? So there's a whole tale of consequences. And this is what I mean with, we need to find the story, because you do one thing and it's like the dominoes, there are consequences everywhere, and suddenly you have a different universe, right? What could possibly be a good explanation for something that yields a lot of carbon and doesn't yield a lot of iron? Well, it's not so much an explanation, more like further explanation. It's more like finding a mechanism for what happens in supernovae, and the official term was sort of, as I said, cooked up in order to explain the observations. And we have, by the way, found a whole bunch more of these stars, so that holds. And it's called a fallback mechanism. So actually during the supernova explosion, a massive black hole emerges. And so some of the material falls back onto the black hole. So here is a vacuum cleaner now. Plopped into the middle, right? Like a temporary one that just cleans up some of the elements? Well, sort of, right? Because if you think of the, we haven't talked about this yet, but if you know what a star looks like, a massive star looks like in its interior before it explodes, you have hydrogen and helium still on the outskirts, and then you have your layers of heavier and heavier elements all the way up to iron. So you have an iron core in the center, and because you can't get any energy out of iron, when you want to fuse to iron atoms anymore, right, that's when the supernova explodes, or occurs, really. It's actually an implosion first, and then you have a bounce of the sort of neutron star phase that occurs in the process. That is so awesome. And then the star gets disrupted. Yeah, it's like this giant, you know, basketball, and then, whoa, it all goes out. So implosion first, explosion after. Yeah. And so in the process, right, if you make your black hole basically big enough, it will suck up, right? Yeah. Yeah. It will suck away some of the iron because that's the closest in terms of the layers. You hold on to it, you don't let it escape, and carbon is much further out, you let it all go. Nice. And so… So that explains why you can have a big oomph and not much iron yield. Yes, yes. So is this explained, the HE 1327? Correct. And others like it. Yes. So there's a… There's a… It's very well established now that… It's very well established now that the lower the iron abundance of the stars are, the higher the carbon sort of gets. And carbon is such an interesting element in that regard. If we come back to the formation of the first low mass stars, right? So we had the hotter gas, just hydrogen and helium, that made the first stars. There were 100 solar masses or so because the gas couldn't cool enough. So they were big and puffy. Carbon then, coming from the first stars, was a little bit more powerful. Carbon then, coming from the first stars, was a little bit more powerful. Carbon then, coming from the first stars, was a little bit more powerful. Carbon then, coming from the first stars, was a little bit more powerful. Carbon then, coming from the first stars, was a little bit more powerful. Carbon then, coming from the first stars, was a little bit more powerful. Carbon then, coming from the first stars, probably led to enough cooling in these gas clouds that enabled the formation of the first low mass stars. So think about what happened if there wouldn't have been any carbon, or the properties of the carbon atom would be different. It would not have cooled the gas in such significant ways, perhaps. There wouldn't be any low mass stars. We wouldn't be here today, right? And we're carbon based. And so… I think carbon is really the most important element in the universe for a variety of reasons, because it has enabled this whole evolution that we're now observing and literally seeing in the sky. And it's really fascinating. So combined with the fact that you have the ion deficient, so all of that is probably important to creating humans. Yeah, yeah. We need all the elements, but if you don't have stars, you know, like the Sun, small stars that can actually host planets, that have long lifetimes, you need long, long lifetimes. If you want to have a stable planet and develop humans. So carbon is kind of important in many ways. Yes, yes. This is perhaps an interesting tangent, if I could just mention that you interviewed Mildred Dresselhaus, carbon queen, the remarkable life of the nanoscience pioneer. Is there something you could say about the magic of carbon and the magic of Millie? Well, Millie was certainly magic. She was a professor at MIT for many decades. I met her a number of times. Her photograph, actually a young and an older Millie is still on the wall. Every time I step out of the elevator in one of the buildings, I see it. She pioneered all sorts of carbon nanowork. So she was a material scientist, very far removed from what I do on a daily basis. But yes, carbon has amazing properties when you study it. And again, that's indeed another aspect of why carbon is so fascinating, not just in the cosmos, but also for us, you know, making us, creating us in the way that we can use it. It's wonderful. You sometimes think about this chemical evolution in this big philosophical way that we're the results of that. That chemical evolution, like we're made of this stuff. We're made of carbon. Yes, we're made of star stuff. Yeah. And it came and got right. I mean, it's almost like a cliche statement, but it's also a materials, a chemical, a physics statement. It came from hydrogen and helium. And then somehow this formation has created this interesting complexity of soup that made us. What are we supposed to make of that? Like what, did we just get really lucky? Why did we get all this cool stuff? Yeah, that's a good question. I don't think it's a question that has an answer. I keep just asking why. Yeah. But it's just this incredible mystery. So much cool stuff had to happen. So much, sorry, hot stuff had to happen to create us. Well, right. And so much could have gone wrong and there would have been another outcome, you know? And it's actually amazing how many things kind of fell in place. I mean, maybe that's all sort of, sort of self deterministic in some ways, right? We are who we are because that was the path. Maybe we would have ended up being robots. I don't know. But it's certainly wonderful to, you know, as scientists for us to help contribute unraveling our cosmic history, right? I always say the biological evolution on earth was absolutely facilitated by the chemical evolution of the universe, right? And one doesn't go without the other from a human perspective. That evolution seems to be creating more and more complexity. The kind of interesting clumping of cool stuff seems to be accelerating and increasing. And it's hard not to see as humans that there's some kind of purpose to it, like a momentum towards complexity and beauty, you know? Well, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But yes, everything gets more complicated. - But there's also a beauty to the chemically pristine universe in the early days. - There certainly is, yes. I love the desert with its nothingness. - Yeah. - It has so much aesthetics and appeal. - We came from nothing, we'll return to nothing. So what about H.E. 1523? What's exciting? A red giant star. - Yes. - That's another one of your babies. - Yes. - 13.2 billion years old. - Yeah. - So that one isn't quite as iron deficient as the other one. So probably not a second generation star, but easily second, third, sorry, third, fourth, fifth or so. We can't really pin it down, but it's also not super important for us. What is important is that that star has a very different chemical composition in a sense that, yes, we have all the elements up to iron there. They have sort of normal ratios, which means kind of the same as most other old stars and not too different from the sun, or at least different in quantifiable ways. But it has this huge overload of very heavy elements. And what was so nice about that particular was that I could measure the thorium and the uranium abundance. And again, that was the second of its kind, but the uranium abundance, could be more well determined. So we had a better grasp on that. Now, why are thorium and uranium interesting? They are radioactive elements. They decay. Thorium has a half-life of 14 billion years, I believe, and uranium of 4.7, which, you know, to focus on us on Earth is a really long time, but those kind of timelines are really good when you want to explore the early universe. So there are two questions now that kind of come to mind. Where do these elements come from? And what do they tell us, right? And these, as we know, these heavy elements are made in a specific process. It's a neutron capture process, usually referred to as the R process for rapid neutron capture process. We talked about seed nuclei before, right? So we still don't exactly know where this process can occur. So you have, let's say, a lone iron atom somewhere, and it is in an environment where you have a strong neutron flux, which means there must be lots of neutrons around. And again, when we talk about the site, we can surmise and ponder where that might be the case. But you have this iron atom and you bombard it with neutrons and you do it incredibly fast. Now, what happens in the process? That iron atom, you collect lots of neutrons, it becomes really big and unstable. So it's a heavy neutron-rich nucleus that wants to decay because it's not stable, it's way too big. And so let's say you add only one neutron to it, that would already make it unstable. So it will then, it has a characteristic decay time, that's called the beta decay timescale. So it will decay to a stable nucleus. So the neutron will convert to a proton and that makes it stable. If you now bombard lots and lots and lots of neutrons onto that seed nucleus within that timescale of the beta decay, that's how you get to this huge fat neutron-rich nucleus that then wants to decay, right? So the rapid processes, you have your seed nuclei, they get bombarded. You create these really heavy neutron-rich nuclei. They're heavier than uranium even. The neutron flux stops and then all these heavy nuclei, they decay. And they make all these stable isotopes that we know of, all the way up to thorium and uranium. So that rapid nuclei decay is what creates all the fungal... Correct. And the whole thing is done within two seconds. So just to add to the rapid here, literally the snapping on my hand, it's all there. In my talks, I often have this nice simulation that illustrates this creation of these heavy nuclei. And I always say, this is the only simulation you will ever see that's slower than real time. Because in astronomy, we show, oh, this is how a galaxy forms. 13 billion years in 30 seconds. Really short, right? This is the opposite. Me showing you this, the elements are long made. So where and when... When does this happen? Does this process happen? So you need the strong neutron flux. That's the clumping of the neutrons. Yes, that's right. And so there are not that many options, right? So where do you find lots of neutrons in the universe? So it's neutron stars, right? Neutron stars form in the making of supernovae, of the explosions. Okay, so maybe some of this heavy material gets sort of made in the making of the supernova explosion and then gets expelled. Or you have neutron stars. So if the neutron star... I mean, usually that's the leftover of a supernova. If you have two from a binary pair... So stars usually actually show up in pairs. And so it's not too unusual to create a pair of neutron stars that will still orbit each other after both of their progenitor stars have exploded. And those two neutron stars will orbit each other diligently. But as we know now, thanks to LIGO, the Gravitational Wave Observatory... I mean, we know already that before, but now it's been measured by LIGO, is that these two neutron stars, they will orbit each other for like forever, but in the process they will lose energy. So that orbit is what we call the orbit decays. And eventually the two neutron stars will merge, and that results in an explosive event that has roughly the energy of a supernova, but the process is completely different. And the cool thing is when these two neutron stars collide, they produce a gravitational wave signature because neutron stars are super dense objects. They are like giant atomic nucleuses. So there's a lot of interesting physics happening already. And so if you basically form a super neutron star by smashing two into each other, more interesting physics happens. And that means that there's this ripple sent out into the space-time continuum, basically. What do people say? The ripples of space-time. It's like you drop a rock into water, right? You see the waves coming. So that's exactly what happens when two neutron stars merge. And this is neutrons galore, right? It's really violent to smash two neutron stars that are so dense already. And so the two neutron stars merge, and they're already into each other. And in 2017, one of these events occurred, and the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave observatories, they detected that. And then the astronomers pointed their telescopes in that direction, and they indeed observed what we call the electromagnetic counterpart. So there was something seen in the sky that faded over the course of two weeks, and that light curve, that light, was exactly what you get when you create all these heavy neutron-rich nuclei in the R process, and then the neutron flux stops. And then it takes about two or three weeks for most of them, of these nuclei, to decay to stability. So we saw, the astronomers saw, in this electromagnetic counterpart, the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements occurring. That's just awesome. That's amazing. So that's an electromagnetic counterpart to the gravitational waves that were detected with two neutron stars colliding aggressively, violently, to create a super neutron star. And that's where you get all the neutrons and the neutron flux somehow, and then the whole shebang that happens in two seconds and creates a bunch of heavy neutrons. So that confirmed that one of the sites, for sure, is for the R process to occur is neutron star mergers. Interestingly enough, I have to mention this here, a year prior, in 2016, my former grad student Alex G. and I, we discovered a small dwarf galaxy that is currently orbiting the Milky Way, it's called Reticulum 2, that was full of ancient iron-deficient stars that also had a strong signature of these heavy elements, exactly like HE 1523. We weren't looking for that. I actually wanted to prove that they had really low levels of heavy elements, because that's what we had seen in all the other dwarf galaxies. And I was dead set on showing that that is yet the case again, and that that is a typical signature of early star formation. We already talked about low strontium and barium abundances and the oldest stars, right? This is what we had seen anecdotally in the ancient dwarf galaxies that are surrounding us. Oh, I see. So, this is the dwarf galaxy. That dwarf galaxy has a bunch of ancient stars in it. Yes. Yes. And so now we find Reticulum 2, and it has these, the stars show the signature of the rapid neutron capture process, the R process, and we are like, okay, these stars are located in a dwarf galaxy right now. We have environmental information. They are not lost in the galaxy where we don't know where they actually came from. No, we know these stars were formed in that galaxy because they're still in it. Mm-hmm. And that, we already deduced from that that it must have been a neutron star merger that went off in Reticulum 2 at early times that polluted the gas from which all our little stars formed. Can you speak to what a dwarf galaxy is? Can you speak to what this Reticulum 2 dwarf galaxy is that is orbiting the Milky Way galaxy? Yeah. It's going to be eaten by it presumably? It totally is going to be eaten. Okay. I can't tell you exactly when. Yeah. The Milky Way remains surrounded by dozens of small stars. Yeah. And it's going to be eaten by dozens of small dwarf galaxies. They're collections of stars. Some of them, we call them ultra-faint dwarf galaxies because they now only contain, I don't know, a few thousand stars. Very, very faint. They're still detectable? Yes, because they're fairly close, and we detect actual individual stars in them. So I've observed some of the faintest stars. You know, you possibly observe with current telescopes in these dwarf galaxies because, I was like, I need to know. I need to know what the chemical composition is because there are leftovers from the early universe, right? Yeah. They did not get eaten. So they're still in their native surroundings. It's like getting the lions in the wild, right? I got to study those and compare to the counterparts that got eaten and are now in the Milky Way. And so I- So presumably most of those stars, it's not all of those stars in that dwarf galaxy are really ancient. They're all really ancient because actually, as it turns out, they're not all really ancient. So, if you have a small galaxy, there was a process early on in the universe called reionization that kind of heated up everything. And together with some supernova explosions in an early shallow bound system, all these little systems lost their gas. It was sort of blown out or it simply evaporated or both, probably both. And so these systems have been unable to continue to form stars since. So it's the best for us stellar archaeologists that you could hope for because it's a whole bunch of stars still sitting there. It's not just one. It's a whole bunch of them still sitting there ever since and nothing has, literally nothing has happened to them. They've just been waiting there for us. So from the stellar archaeology perspective, what is juicier and more interesting, the old stars in the outskirts that have been eaten, are the outskirts of Milky Way or the stars in the dwarf galaxies? What's of all the things you love about the world? You said you love stars. So which do you love more of your children? That's a hard one. I mean, I love them all, of course. They serve different purposes. The stars in the Milky Way, I can get much, much, much better data for them because they're brighter, they're closer, so they're brighter. And that tickles my fancy. And they have interesting kinematics, presumably. Yes, and we can get that. And so HE 1523, for example, that one is really bright. It's a red giant, so it's intrinsically bright and it's fairly close. And so the data I got for that was insanely good and that yielded this uranium detection and thorium detection. I can never get that kind of data for a dwarf galaxy star. So that's a big trade-off. But the environmental information that we get along with the basic information about stars in each dwarf galaxy is really, really valuable in establishing, for example, these site information, right? Because the galaxy is still there, so nothing crazy could have happened. So actually, to close that loop, probably some heavy elements come out of supernovae here and there, but somehow my theory colleagues tell me that a normal supernova just doesn't have enough oomph to really get an R-process going and doing it all. We need these orbiting supernovae. We need probably the neutron star mergers, or we need a special kind of supernova that's maybe extremely massive or heavily rotating or does something else funny, right, to really kind of get that particular process going. But the normal supernovae don't do it, right? So only a little bit comes out. But you could come along and say, "Anna, why don't you just take 100 supernovae together to build up the yield?" But then I come along and say, "Look, this dwarf galaxy is still intact today, if you would have plugged in the R-process, it would have been a hundred supernovae. If you had plugged in a hundred supernovae into this little system early on, it would have blown apart. It would have blown apart past five supernovae, or ten. So that's a really important constraint that we have, that these systems are still alive, right? So it helps us to pin down where certain processes could have possibly happened. And so it's just a different type of information that we get. It'd be amazing if we could talk about the observational aspect of this, the tools of observation. So what telescopes have you used, do you use, and what does the data look like? And I think I've read a few interesting stories about the actual process of day-to-day observation, a bunch of probably late nights. Well, yeah, astronomers are doing it all night long, so we have lots of late nights. Can you explain the all-night-long aspect of it? Well, let me start by saying I mostly these days use the Magellan telescopes in Chile. They are 6.5-meter telescopes. They're very, very good. They have a telescope, which means the mirror diameter is 6.5 meters. That's not the largest that is out there, but it's among the largest. And I use a spectrograph because I'm a spectroscopist. I don't take pictures. And that particular spectrograph at that telescope is actually unusually efficient, so it kind of makes up for the fact that the mirror isn't as large in, let's say, the 8-meter telescopes from the European Space Agency. So I'm very happy with that. Efficiency meaning? How many photons get collected sort of per time unit. Sure. Because that's always the limiting factor. Prior to the pandemic, we would travel to Chile to do our observations. Those telescopes are the last observatory where people were sort of supposed to travel there and take their own observations. Most other observatories, they're not as large as the ones in Chile. So we're not going to be able to do that. But we're going to be able to do that. And we're going to be able to do that. So we're going to be able to do that. And we're going to be able to do that. And we're going to be able to do that. And we're going to be able to do that. And we're going to be able to do that. So there's the directly, the scientists are specifying where to point the telescope and sitting there and collecting the data, making sure the data is collected well, the cleaning of the data, the offloading of the data. All that kind of stuff. Yeah. So it's mostly done for them. Yeah. Obviously, that's super convenient. But it also takes away a central part of what the work of an astronomer is, which is data collection. Right? We don't have an experiment in the basement where we can go day and night or whenever we please and ask a certain question of the apparatus. Right? Let's turn this knob and see what happens. Let's turn that knob and see what happens. No, we only have one experiment, which is the universe. And what we see is what we get. And I think it's so important to take an active role in that. So I really love going to the observatory. I've taken many students there over the years to teach them and to just show them what it means to be an astronomer. Because you go to these remote mountaintops. And it's such a magical environment. And you wait there for the sun to go down. And then you get ready and you look outside. And it's such a serene environment. It's a little bit out of this world. You're sitting there. So the sun goes down. It's evening, late evening. And what does it look like? What are some of the most magical experiences of that process? Well, when you're on top of a mountain, climbers, I guess. I get to see that probably otherwise. It's very calm. And the colors are so beautiful. And I always become much calmer when I'm there. I'm just A, because I'm just there for one purpose only. That's data collection. I can say no to my emails. I can say no to everything else because I'm observing. So there's literally less distraction. There's no distractions because you're just there to do one thing. And also the emails somehow seem less significant. Yeah, yeah. It's just you can't afford to focus on just one thing. And it just kind of does something to you. It's a little hard to describe. But if you then fast forward, maybe I can speak a little bit about that. I have done a lot of astrophotography there as well, and observing faint dwarf galaxy stars. And I was just there for 45 minutes, 55 minute exposure. So you actually have a lot of time. So I would run outside and just lay on the ground under the southern Milky Way. Beautiful, right up there. And I would just lay there like the snow angel and just stare up there and just kind of let my thoughts sort of pass through my brain and just like, I'm one of it. Right? And I personally have the feeling that I'm a part of it. I belong here rather than feeling kind of small. Yes, I'm small, but there are many other small things and lots of small things make one big hole. Yeah, we're part of that big hole. So that's looking at the inner spirals of the Milky Way galaxy. And just this dark sky with the bright stars. And I have described this in my book years ago. If the Milky Way is all bright above us, then we're not going to be able to see the Milky Way. Right. And if it's all bright above you, you don't need a moon or anything. You can walk in the starlight and you will find your way. There are no trees there for safety reasons, but you wouldn't even run into a tree, right? I mean, you can see. You can almost see the shadow from the starlight because it's such a dark side and the stars are so bright. And these are kind of moments that kind of change you a little bit. You see the unity of it all. Yeah. And it's just you and nature. And with modern civilization and all of that, I think we often try a little bit too hard to be removed from nature, to be independent of it and figuring it all out. But at the end of the day, we're just a part of it. And that really helps me to remember that we're one and the same. Well, that fills me with hope that I tend to think of us humans as in the very early days of whatever the heck. We are. So that makes me think thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of years from now, that we'll be reaching, whatever we become, we'll be traveling out there to explore more and more and more. So what you're doing is the early days of exploration with the tools we have. Yes, the early seafarers looking at the sky for navigation. Coming up with different theories of what's on the other side, that the earth is starting to gain an intuition that the earth may be round. And then we might be able to navigate all the way around to get to the financial benefits of getting spices from India, whatever the grant funding process is all about. But ultimately actually results in a deep understanding of the mystery that's all around us. And I mean, it's just to travel out there. To me, the discovery of life in the solar system, I really hope to see that in my life. In my lifetime. Some kind of life. Bacteria, something. Maybe dead. Because that means there's life everywhere. And that's just the kind of stuff that might be out there. All the different environmental conditions, chemically speaking, that are out there. And it just seems like when you look at earth, life finds a way to survive, to thrive in whatever conditions. And maybe that process just kind of humbles you and is super exciting to know that there is life out there of different forms. And of course that raises the question of what is life even? We tend to have a very human-centric perspective of what is a living organism and what is intelligence and all this kinds of stuff. And all the work in artificial intelligence now is starting to challenge our ideas of what makes human beings special. And I think we're doing that through all kinds of ways. And I think you're working some part doing that as well. The unity you feel is realizing we're part of this big mechanism of nature, whatever that is, that's creating all kinds of cool stuff from the humble, pristine origins to today. So if you could just kind of linger on the process of the data, what does the data look like? And how does the raw data lead to a data? A discovery of an ancient star? Well, as a spectroscopist, we have to, I guess, talk for a brief moment about what a spectrum is. Everyone, I hope, has seen a rainbow in the sky. That is basically what we're doing. We don't send the starlight through a raindrop that then gets bounced around and splits up the light into the rainbow colors. We do it. We do it with a spectrograph, so basically a prism. So we send the starlight through a prism of sorts and that splits it up. And then we record exactly that. So it's a little 2D picture actually of a spectrum. Now it's not going to look colorful, just black and white. Different colors have, of course, different energies. That's what we record. More specifically, we record it as light. As wavelengths. So wavelengths and frequency and energies all the same at the end of the day. We process that little image in a sense that we do a cross cut and then sum up a few columns so that we get all the data that we recorded. And what we see is a, it's a bit funny to describe just with words, but a wiggly line with lots of dips. So the 2D process spectrum. We call it continuum. So it's just a flat line basically. And then there are dips. So the interesting things are the dips. If you think back of the rainbow, what we actually see in our stars is not just a rainbow, but it would be a rainbow with lots of black lines in it, which means certain little pieces of color have been eaten away by a certain amount. And so we can no longer see it as well or not at all. Why is that happening? So if we, if we come back to our stars, what we're observing, we're observing the stellar surface. We can actually never peer with our telescopes inside. We only ever go, can go after the surface. And the surface contains, or the surface layer contains different kinds of elements. Every one of those types of atoms, so elements are just different types of atoms, they absorb different photons that are coming from the hot core where the fusion is happening. And so that means that if you were the observer, you know, with a spectrograph or without, you will see the starlight, but certain frequencies, certain energies of that light will have been absorbed by all the different atoms in the gas. So you see less of them. And so those are the dips and the strength of the dips tell us, you know, which element was it and how much of that. Element was or is in, in the star. So we have many, many, many dips. The solar spectrum for reference, you know, all the dips are overlapping because the abundance of all the elements is so high. It's actually very complicated spectrum. My spectra really look like a straight line and then there's a dip here and then you have the straight line again, there's a dip there. The sun doesn't have straight lines. I mean, it's just all absorbed in some form or another. Um, but the old stars. Have so little off all the elements that they're only occasionally these, these dips that then indicate, okay, that one at that wavelength was iron and here we have carbon and there's magnesium and sodium and, oh, there's a little strontium line here. So we have a much easier way to, um, map out this barcode that the spectrum, you know, pretty much is at the end of the day and to then measure the strength of these, we call it absorption lines. to then calculate with existing codes that mimic the physics of the stellar atmospheres, like how much was absorbed, what kind of elements were present in the stellar atmosphere. And so this is how we get to our abundance measurements, and then altogether that gives us the chemical composition and that particular signature in that star. Do you ever look at the raw spectrograph in the absorption line, and are able to see into it some interesting non-standard outlier kind of patterns? Or does this have to do heavy amount of processing? We actually process our… it's fairly straightforward to do our processing. We do it at the telescope, so I often take a shorter exposure first, let's say 10 or 15 minutes. So mostly when I do discovery work, we would just take a quick… look spectrum, then we process it while we observe the next star. Then we take a quick look. We have what I call the summary plot. It's a collection of little areas in the spectrum that have the key positions, the positions of the key elements in it. And it's kind of like reading the tea leaves. I have stared at so many spectra. I just need to know, I just need to see our summary plot, and I can tell you exactly what the numbers are going to be. And also tell you the numbers. And also to tell if it's going to be promising to look at further. Yes, exactly. And so that's it. Thumbs up, thumbs down. Are you worth my time or not? In most cases it's not, or it's good enough. We can do a basic analysis, maybe publish this as part of a larger sample, just so we output that we have observed the star and their basic nature. That's an important part to publish as well. And yeah, I had a run. So now we do remote observing. I do all of this now. I'm not from my home, from my living room, all night long. And I often work with colleagues. So we do it over Zoom and we process the data. We look at it, same thing still. And we just found a star that had a very low iron abundance. And then we decided, okay, that looks interesting. We're just going to keep exposing. So we took more data on it on the spot and we're writing up the paper right now. How do you know where to point the telescope? It's not random. There's a lot of work that goes into that. I began my career by trying to answer that question as in like doing the search process. That's why I called my book that I've written some time ago, Searching for the Oldest Stars, because searching is one thing. It's very time consuming. And then on top of that, not everyone finds, right? And I often don't find. But I keep searching because our techniques have established that, yes, we can do it if we're just patient enough and keep going because it's a numbers game. And that's often the case in science. And that's something that not enough is talked about, how tedious it is and how long it takes to get to that one discovery, right? That moves the field further. And how difficult it is to find. How difficult it is to believe that there is a thing to be discovered. Yes. Yes. We have the saying, I learned this, I think from my supervisor, one star is a discovery, two is a sample, and three is a population. So as soon as you found three of roughly the same kind, you're done. But you need to get there. Yeah. Probably the first is the hardest, right? Yes. But it kind of remains really hard. But the thing is then at past three, many of us are like, okay, we solved that problem. We've done it three times, we can do it. That's a thing, right? That's a population. Three iron deficient stars, let's say, right? That's one puzzle piece. Now we can move on to the next thing. That's an indicator that there's many more of them potentially. Yes. Yes. Yes. So to cut a long story short about the searching, we started early on with what's called low-resolution spectroscopy of many stars. So for example, my thesis work almost 20 years ago was piggybacking off a quasar survey that had collected... So quasars are basically giant supermassive black holes that are really far away. So you only see one big bright light point. So it looks like a star, but it's actually just a giant supermassive black hole that outshines its own galaxy. And people had been trying to study those. And they found a little spectra of all things in the sky. And it turns out, oh, you can fish out the actual stars from that and look for certain signatures that might indicate low metallicity stars, so stars with low abundances. And so it was painstaking work to then take medium-resolution spectroscopy to get a little bit more information and to use approximations and to kind of get candidates that we can then eventually take to the big glass like Magellan. And so we really see the dips of all the individual elements that then give us the final answer, is it yay or nay? These days with another grad student, I developed a new technique to use images actually of all the stars in the sky taken with very narrow filters. So it's like you're wearing very specific glasses that only let so much light through. And you can do similar things through having several narrow band filters, what we call it, to fish out things that have no absorption over here, so just the straight line, and then a little dip here, so a little something there. And that has proven fairly successful in recent years. So looking at the entire, looking at broader regions of space. That's right, because these stars are a little bit like the needle in the haystack, right? Yeah. And there's not that many left over, and certainly the galaxy has made plenty of stars in between. We need to comb through all of those to get to the goods. So we always start with millions and then work our way down, and in the end we have like three good candidates. I wonder how those ancient stars feel that they were noticed. They probably know that nobody pays attention. Well, we're all special, right? So are the stars. It's good. It's inspiring, even if you're the outcast. In your pristine nature, you still might nevertheless be noticed. I'm hoping the same about humans, if somebody's observing us. Is there something else you could say that's about the challenges of this kind of high precision measurement that you're doing? So this kind of collection of data looking, trying to pull out the signal from the noise out there? Well, that's lovely. That's literally what we're doing in multiple ways, actually. So we're trying to find the needle in the haystack, and then we find something. And then it turns out it's just a little bit too faint to actually get the kind of data quality on it that we would like, or that would be warranted given the potential of the star, right? It's like, "Ugh." So there's always noise. There's always a little bit of noise, and you have to try to say, "What? Yeah, how special is this?" When you're looking at the absorption line. Yeah. How? So the most iron-poor stars, their iron lines are so tiny that they're literally almost in the noise. So you need incredibly good data to make detections. And the funny thing is, we're looking for the nothingness of, let's say, the iron lines, but then we don't want nothing because if there's nothing in the spectrum, we can't measure anything. We can only get an upper limit. But we'd really like a measurement. So we are looking for the last little bit. The last little bit that you could possibly detect. And that's the strong function of the brightness of the star, because the telescopes have the size that they do. That's not going to change for a while. Hopefully eventually it will, but it's going to be at least 10 years out. And so, yes, we're often literally stuck in the noise because we can't make the measurements. So actually the record holder for the most iron-poor star only has an upper limit. We can't get enough data on this to actually pinpoint a measurement to then take it to our theory colleagues and say, "Give me this limit." And then we can't even get enough data to get this little iron out of your first star. So it's a bit frustrating, but also super exciting at the same time. So let's go to both sides of that spectrum. What's the most exciting discovery to you personally? Is there a moment you remember that you saw a piece of data and your heart skipped a bit? Yeah, of course. Probably one of those moments. I wasn't actually present at the telescope, but we were sent the data immediately from our colleague. And we just looked at it and our eyes got really wide and it was like, "Oh my God, is this really what we think it is?" So we had to run some numbers and it was. And these are magical little moments. The thing is, often we have false positives. And so there's always this kind of piece. Period. And often it's, I don't know, 10, 15 minutes where you need to make some tests to kind of make the decision. Is this really something I should keep observing now? Is this really as good as I think? Or am I being fooled by something? Right? So actually, if you take a spectrum of a white dwarf, a white dwarf is the leftover core of a star like the sun that has gone extinct. And white dwarfs have lost all their outer atmosphere. So it's just the hydrogen helium core. So they look like a metal poor star. That's only hydrogen helium left, right? But the hydrogen lines that you can see in the spectrum of our stars and of the white dwarfs are a little bit wider than normal. So you need to have a good eye just to check, you know, does this look a little bit wider than us? Is this a white dwarf who's fooling me here? Right? And so it's like this moment, it's like, "Oh my God." It's just minutes of nervousness. Yes. Yes. And sometimes, you know, it's a dud and sometimes it's not. What's been a big, that you remember, heartbreak? Like a painful low point? Is it all leading up to the first? Is it all about HE 1327 again? Just the leading up to it? Or has there been like a... Yeah, has there been like low points in the search? That's a good question. I mean, you know, it starts with mundane things as in like you want your telescope time, you travel there and the weather is completely cloudy. It rains and you had three nights, which is a lot, and you go home empty handed. So that's definitely a low point. Probably not what you were thinking of, but there is a certain occupational hazard to it. Which requires a kind of resilience and a patience. Yeah. And you just got to learn to live with it. Coming back to reticulum too, actually, you know, that little dwarf galaxy, that was a run that we had and the weather was incredibly bad. And I had sent my student there and I was at home and he calls me at 2:00 AM and he was like, "Anna, I think I observed the wrong star. I'm so sorry." There is this line there, this Europium line, and it looks like a metal rich star. And I was like, "It's cool. We all make mistakes. Send me the data. Send me that summary plot." And so I look at it, you know, I was like super tired. It's like... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can't really tell. It doesn't look wrong, but I can't tell you right now that it's right either. So why don't you go to the next target? And he calls me back an hour later, "Anna, it looks just the same. What am I supposed to do?" And then I joked, "Well, maybe we found an R-process galaxy. Let's go to the next one." And the weather was degrading. And so to cut a long story short. I had to come... So he was observing the right stars. It was an R-process galaxy, the first one we had ever discovered, totally unpredicted. We had no idea that this was a thing. I mean, you know, of course, we thought that such a thing might possibly exist, because why not, right? Neutron star mergers happen somewhere. Crazy supernovae, probably too. But we were not prepared in that moment to find this thing. And in the end, the weather was getting worse and worse, and we wanted to see how many R-process stars are in this galaxy. So we managed by our hairline to observe the nine brightest stars, but the data quality was atrocious. And the weather affects the data quality. Yes, absolutely, because these were really faint stars. And so... Yeah. And so we were really lucky by making a very tight strategy of getting the absolute bare minimum for all the stars, so we could at least take a very crude look. Is it a yay or is a nay? We couldn't even say yes or no, just to get an idea, because we needed to know. Why was that important? Because we could only observe this system again nine months later. So there's always a window of observation. Yes. It was setting. It was our chance, and it was going away with the clouds. That was super high stakes. But we just made it. Really, it was almost impossible. And it was just... The thing is, this is such a serendipitous moment in a serendipitous moment. The enhancement of these heavy elements was so strong that even in this really crappy data, we could still see the enhancement. The absorption was so strong, they stuck out of the noise. If that enhancement wouldn't have been as strong, we would not have been able to say anything because we wouldn't have been able to tell. But because it was so extreme, it lend us a hand, despite the weather and all, to say like, "Yes, this is it." So that was quite the night. Luck. I mean, a lot of this is just luck. So that was the first Art Process Galaxy discovery. Yes. I didn't sleep all that much. Do you have hope? Are you excited about James Webb Space Telescope and other telescopes in the future that increase the resolution and the precision of what can be detected out there? Absolutely. JWST is fantastic already. I am not planning to use it personally, although I think I'm on one or two observing proposals actually because, similar to what we already spoke about. We're interested in the same thing. We're just kind of looking at different sides of the fence. I have my old surviving stars and I concoct these little stories about what the earliest galaxies may have looked like, what the objects were that contributed energy and elements and all these things. My JWST colleagues, they try to detect some of these earliest photons from these earliest systems to look at the energetics and other things. What was there? How many? These kinds of things. Right? So together we're trying to explore this first billion years, but we do it in very complimentary ways. And so I'm very excited to see what they can come up with and how that helps me to inform my stories better and more comprehensively. What do you think is the future of the field of stellar archaeology? How much can we... Maybe what are the limits of our... Our understanding of this first billion years of our universe? Well, obviously lots of limitations in the sense that I always say I have a metal pore star for any of your questions because there are so many different kinds out there and we still find new patterns sometimes, right? And there needs to be an explanation. The question is, is it ultimately just one quirky star or is it two or is it three, right? Is it a sample? Is it a population? So we haven't concluded that kind of work yet. So every metal pore star is a kind of data point that you can use to improve the quality of your model of how the evolution of the early universe. Yes. Yes. And I would say we've made huge progress over the last 20 years. When I joined that field, it was in its infancy and there was this serendipitous discovery of that first, second generation star. And we have filled in the canvas a great deal since then, and this is what I have greatly enjoyed about it. I'm so happy about doing so because there was so much discovery potential and it's been dying down a little bit because of all the progress. It's on the up and coming again because there are so many large spectroscopic surveys in the works now that will just provide a different level of data that we haven't had before. I'm sort of of this older generation. I have only very few colleagues. I work in small teams. I observe every single star myself. Whatever I can, I do myself. I don't generally take other people's data, at least certainly not in the end stage. And I'm not a big data kind of person, although we're all headed that way. I certainly use data from the Gaia astrometric satellite for the kinematics, for example. But that's personally a new thing for me to use. I'm not a big data scientist. I'm not a big data scientist.
