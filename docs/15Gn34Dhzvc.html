There's a real allure to that. But when you implement these crowded schedules in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the child's real life, it's mainly basically people yelling in a Honda Odyssey. It's all this overhead,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">all this stress, everyone is exhausted. And so your schedule on paper, this is just my personal opinion,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">should probably be way more sparse than in the moment when you're creating a schedule for your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">kids.

They don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">They want to be with you and not be really tired. So that frees more time on the weekend, so you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">really spend more time together. And then you choose your moments, I suppose, in the weeknights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We do dinner together. There's build something around the bedtime routine. You know, I'm a big believer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in having one outing per kid per week. All right, we are going to go, I'm going to pick you up from school,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">just you, and we're going to go throw the baseball around and get dinner. Okay, me and you are going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to go to the bookstore on this night and get a book. And so, you know, some days are busy, you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">have time for this. But if a kid is getting, and again, I have no back, I'm not the expert on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">My only expertise is like everyone else who's a parent. I have a bunch of kids and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">this is just me pulling stuff, you know, out of a hat here. So keep that in mind. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">if a kid feels like they've had one serious one-on-one thing with you per week, and there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">time spent with them every day, and they're not completely exhausted being dragged around on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">weekend, I think that's probably pretty good. I think that's probably pretty good. I think you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">about, you're doing everything you need to do. And I wouldn't be too guilty behind it. Fitness, I said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in the beginning, you can probably hack that. I mean, fitness really is a thing that, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">if you've got young kids and they're in school, I don't know, I don't think you can, it's optimal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to lose like an hour of that evening time exercising. So I think you should steal that from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">work to the extent possible. Just find a way to steal that time from work. Just go during the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">lunch hour, bike to work and exercise at the gym nearby before you go to work. Do it in the morning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">before you go. I often am exercising after I put the kids to bed, so I don't have a lot of time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">then. So I do very intense, high intensity exercising just so I can get it done. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">something where I think you can steal time from work. That's my other hack. Maybe not all my hacks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">should really reduce the steal stuff from work. That's my other hack is steal time from work for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">household admin too. I'll be efficient about it, but there's 30 minutes well deployed in the middle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of a workday can get a lot done that needs to be done for the household. So, you know, hopefully no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">administrators are working. I used to use the first 30 minutes. I mean, there's no real workday</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">for being a professor, but I would spend what most people would consider to be the first 30 minutes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of the workday after nine, always doing household admin. And I found if you could do 30 minutes of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">household admin every morning before you start your day, the amount that awaits you at the end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of the week or in the evening is actually much less. So this idea that when you're at work as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a knowledge worker, that it's like you're clocking in at a factory and every minute you should be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">cranking widgets. That's crazy. There's ups, there's downs, high intensity recovery. So steal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">some time for exercise from work, steal some time for household admin, and then mess around with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Gn34Dhzvc&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">type of strategies I talked about before.
