One covers all the overhead, all the way down to the credit card processing fees, and then the other is just directly to go towards causes.</p><p>- The model for Charity Water really came out of just listening to everyday people. I said, well, what would make you compelled to give? And the 100% model just came out of that. Well, people said, if I knew that 100% of what I gave would actually help people, I'd be more likely to give.</p><p>I said, all right, well, this just needs to look like two separately audited bank accounts, and in one bank account, I'm gonna raise my hand and go try to find business leaders and entrepreneurs who are not skeptical, and actually who wouldn't mind paying those unsexy overhead costs. And then I can go out to the public and say, great, not your problem.</p><p>If you give a dollar or a million dollars, every single penny, every dollar will go directly to build these water projects, which get people clean water.</p></div></div></body></html>
