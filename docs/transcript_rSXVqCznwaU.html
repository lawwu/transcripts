You say to somebody, "How would you like to be financially independent? You have enough money, you never have to work again." I don't think too many people are going to say, "No, I wouldn't want that." You know, I mean, everybody's going to say, "Well, that sounds great, but are you willing to pay the price?</p><p>Are you willing to do the work?" "Yeah, you know, that sounds great, but I've got to keep this expensive house I have because we need to have the two least luxury cars, and of course, kids have to go to the private schools," and the list goes on and on, and that's the tyranny of must-haves.</p><p>The more must-haves you have, the less likely you are to be financially independent. If somebody says, "Yeah, you know, I really want to start a business, but I don't want to give up my nights and weekends, and I want to go to two-hour lunches," it has to be perhaps the most important thing to you.</p><p>So for me, there was nothing that my money could buy that was more valuable to me than my financial freedom than my independence.</p></div></div></body></html>
