How do I want to spend my time with who, at what frequency, et cetera? I think those are the types of decisions that really impact your life because you can start going down a path.</p><p>And once you realize that, so I talked a little bit about the level four stuff, it's because most people are going to get stuck in there. They'll never get out. And you're spending all this time running on the hamster wheel and you're never going to get out. And it doesn't really impact your wealth that much anymore.</p><p>And you're working so hard for what? And I don't understand why people do it. And so I think that's a big mindset shift is like realizing, okay, once you understand the lap, the ladder and all the decisions behind it, you can make much better decisions on about how you use your time and what you do with your life.</p></div></div></body></html>
