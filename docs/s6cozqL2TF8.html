Creatine hydrochloride has some hype around it. Apparently, it's a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">more soluble. The claim is that you need less, but there's only a couple studies on it, and it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">more expensive. And creatine monohydrate is not particularly expensive. I realize people have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=37" target="_blank">00:00:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">different budgets, but it's not, it doesn't land in the, it's not a budget breaker. Yeah, it's gotten</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=41" target="_blank">00:00:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">more expensive because of COVID and supply chain issues. Even the, there's forms of creatine that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.460</a></span> | <span class="t">appear to be as good, like hydrochloride, but it's more expensive. And then things like creatine ethyl</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.700</a></span> | <span class="t">ester has been shown to be worse than creatine monohydrate. Buffered creatine is as good or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">worse, and it's much more expensive. So I tell people just take creatine monohydrate. It is tried</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and true. It's been shown to saturate the muscle cells 100% with phosphocreatine, and that's what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.700</a></span> | <span class="t">you want. So creatine works through a few different methodologies. One, through increasing phosphocreatine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">content, which helps improve exercise performance. It also appears to improve recovery, and it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">increases lean mass, a lot of which is through bringing water into the muscle cells. But that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">is, I mean, muscle cells are mostly water. So when people say, well, it's just water, that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">what muscle cells mostly are. And it also increases strength and some other metrics. Now, it also has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.020</a></span> | <span class="t">been shown in studies that people tend to get a decrease in body fat percentage. Now that's probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">because they're getting an increase in lean mass. And so the relative is a decrease in body fat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">percentage. But there are a few studies that show a decrease in fat mass as well. I don't think that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.700</a></span> | <span class="t">creatine is a fat burner. I think that people are able to train harder, build more lean tissue. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.100</a></span> | <span class="t">that's probably having an effect on fat mass. Then they've actually shown more recently some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">cognitive benefits to creatine, which I find really interesting as well. But the only knock on creatine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that anybody's been able to come up with, because they've debunked the kidney stuff, they've debunked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">the liver stuff, there's no evidence that it harms healthy kidney or liver, is hair loss. So what about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.060</a></span> | <span class="t">hair loss? Because there was one study in 2009 that showed that creatine increased DHT.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But they didn't really show an effect on any other sex hormone. So it's kind of strange. Like you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">think if there was an increase in DHT, there would be like something else that changes as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's only one study. And again, didn't directly measure hair loss, measured DHT, which we know is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.540</a></span> | <span class="t">involved in the loss of the follicle. So what I would say is that I am not convinced. It's only one study,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.980</a></span> | <span class="t">never been replicated to my knowledge, and it was looking at a mechanism rather than an outcome. So if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody who's prone to hair loss, and you want to avoid creatine because of that, I understand. But for most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.340</a></span> | <span class="t">people, I don't think it's a, I don't think it's something to worry about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you emphasize the classic loading of creatine, taking it a bunch of times per day, and then backing off or just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">taking it consistently at the, I think five grams per day is kind of a typical dose that people take?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, no solutions, only trade-offs. You can load it and you will saturate your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.060</a></span> | <span class="t">phosphocreatine stores faster, like usually within a week. If you just take five grams per day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.700</a></span> | <span class="t">it'll take two, three, four weeks, but you will get to the same place. And you're probably going to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">a much lower risk of GI issues. Some people, creatine can be a gut irritant. If it is for some folks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I would recommend splitting it into multiple doses. So maybe like multiple to one or two gram doses per</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6cozqL2TF8&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.780</a></span> | <span class="t">day. And definitely don't load it if you're somebody who has GI issues from it.</span></div></div></body></html>
