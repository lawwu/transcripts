It feels like in the points and miles world, it's Hyatt, globalist or forget it. A big part of it too, is because airline status is so hard to get with credit cards, while hotel status is given out willy nilly. So you have like all these cards that give you either like mid-level or even like higher level status, Hilton, Diamond being one of the prime examples.</p><p>You're getting a top level status by getting a credit card that runs you 450. And then I would argue that the card actually is a net positive because of all the credits and the free night. So you have all these people that have status because the math makes sense.</p><p>The reason people like Hyatt is because that's the one you actually had to chase and had to do, meaning that there's less people that have it, meaning that. It's more beneficial because upgrades actually come to you.</p></div></div></body></html>
