target="_blank">00:00:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for me, that happened at LinkedIn, where prior to LinkedIn, I had to experience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">all facets of web marketing, whether it's on the strategy side, user experience,

enough under my belt to allow me to succeed at all the previous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The difference at LinkedIn was I joined a group that was essentially a startup.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now it's LinkedIn Learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Everyone knows what LinkedIn Learning is, it's part of the Talent Solutions

had just acquired lynda.com.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there was a need to A, transition to brand, and B, build a new enterprise experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And the challenge there was you have a very strong entity in lynda.com, you're building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a new brand from the ground up, and there's things like SEO to take into consideration,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and there's like your website, but there's also the product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So all of them are competing, right, for SEO visibility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">There's also building the web experience from ground up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So when it came to building web experience and SEO, like that was no problem at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Where I ran into an issue was about seven or eight months into my job, I had launched</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And now LinkedIn, as you guys all know, probably, or not surprisingly, it's a very, very data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">driven company, which is fantastic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It's probably one of the best companies I've worked for where the data is so robust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The data hygiene is pretty valid, like you can trust it to make decisions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So the expectation of insight was really, really high.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Prior to joining LinkedIn, I've always leveraged data and gotten insight out of the data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">What I had not done up to that point was pull the data, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're talking about pulling data out of Google Analytics, pulling data out of Tableau,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">looking into SFDC.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I had experience with Google Analytics, very little exposure to SFDC and Tableau.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so my fear was always that if I'm pulling the data incorrectly, then all of my conclusions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">will be off mark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Or I'll be pulling the data set in a way that other people are not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And it'll be very, very clear that I'm looking at a different data set, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are a few meetings where I was exposed, where I would present a slide.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And like everyone's smart enough where they could say, "Hey, look, that slide doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">jive with something I saw 10 slides ago."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Or "Yesterday I saw a slide from a PMM and they're using something totally different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Like what's going on?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I was always feeling like I was behind the ball.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And it came to a point, it was about the one year mark, where my manager, he pulled me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">aside and he was like, "Look, man, we hired you because you're supposed to know everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And your ability to deliver analytics and dashboards is just not up to par."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And that hurt me so deeply because I thought I was actually making positive progress on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">my dashboards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I realized was I was just delivering what he was asking for, sometimes correctly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.940</a></span> | <span class="t">What I was not doing was bringing anything additional to the table.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I felt like I wasn't providing value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So I really questioned the value of my employment at that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And remember, this is a company where when I came in and interviewed for the job, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">senior director interviewed me as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And the questions that they asked were so in the weeds and specific, they clearly understood</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">my role.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so essentially, I was surrounded by people who I looked to my left, looked to my right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I basically came to the conclusion that everyone could do my job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And I wasn't sure why I was there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I entered a period of depression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was the first time in my career that I felt this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And it wasn't until a change of managers where it totally flipped around, where he came in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and I decided to kind of, like in a previous episode, we talked about kind of getting to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">our know our limits when you're feeling in over your head.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I kind of drew on that where I came to him, I said, "Hey, look, let me tell you what I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">think I'm doing good with my job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And being my new manager, let me tell you why I'm struggling a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's what I'm trying to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's the output I've been creating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's where I think I'm doing it wrong.</span></div><div

well."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I could really use some advisement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">For him, it was also his first time running a digital organization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.680</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">And so now the situation is a different, we're kind of self-discovering it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Va8ZRsROEQ&t=319"
