I am not recommending that everyone needs to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I just think it's an interesting thought experiment.

All right. So that is our goal here. Let me start just by reminding us of the advice I gave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">when I last talked about this, because I'm now going to take that advice, that basic advice, and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">this is just how you lay a base. The equivalent in cognitive fitness and physical fitness, just sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of getting your body moving and flexible and your muscles woken up so you're ready to actually do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">more intense training. So just as a reminder, last time we talked about this, I recommended go on walks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and think during the walks. Don't have something in your ear. Avoid dopamine stacking. So just make a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">rule. I don't dopamine stack. So that means if I'm watching something, I'm not also on my phone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, if I'm reading something, I'm not also checking out videos. I just do one source of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">stimuli at a time. Read more. Doesn't matter what it is. Find what you're excited enough about that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.220</a></span> | <span class="t">you're more likely to stick with it, but just grapple with the written word and maybe seek out a hobby</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that requires more concentration. Like you learn to play the guitar, practicing the guitar requires</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.780</a></span> | <span class="t">concentration, right? So those type of activities remain good activities for laying a base of cognitive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">fitness. Now I have some ideas for how you can push that base into something more elite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">The first idea is interval training. Now this is the basic concept that I talked about, geez, I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">all the way back in deep work. And it was something that I had actually messed around with prior to deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">work when I was a graduate student, primarily writing books for students. And I was working with a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">undergraduates to help them do better in school. And I worked with a variant of interval training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">because a lot of these undergraduates starting around this time, we're starting to struggle with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">concentration. This sort of the distraction era was, was, was on its way in. And we would do this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">training routine where you would focus hard on something. In their case would be academic work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">for a limited amount of time and they would have a timer, but they had to focus hard for that amount</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of time. If their attention wandered, it was like, um, no, no, you got to restart that. You need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">focus for this amount of time. If you, if you look at your, wouldn't have been a phone back then, but if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">you jump on the internet or something like that, you have to restart. And then only once they got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.780</a></span> | <span class="t">comfortable with a given interval, I would increase it by 10 minutes. All right, now let's try getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">comfortable with this new length of time. So it's interval training. You get comfortable with an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">interval that's a stretch, and then you stretch that interval even farther. And I found in like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">a semester or two, you could get a relatively distracted undergraduate from this sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">pre-smartphone era up to like 90 minutes of concentration pretty comfortably. I can lock</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in for 90 minutes. So I'm going to recommend that as like the first elite training technique.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">The key is to have something demanding of concentration to be focusing on during your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">interval training sessions. And so this could be, you know, reading a hard book or taking an online</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">course or working on a musical instrument practice is a great one that requires intense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">concentration or maybe a professional problem. This just like really challenging. You need a good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.940</a></span> | <span class="t">thing to focus on that is hard. And then you use this timer. I recommend maybe once every two weeks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">or so. Like if you're comfortable with something, you want to give it at least two weeks before you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">increase it. And it might take more if it just takes you more time. If you find a duration, like you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">really can't get through it very well. It might take you longer until you're comfortable. That's okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that stretches where your brain gets stronger. All right. The second idea, dialectical reading.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this is, we're moving here from interval training is about just the generic ability to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">concentrate. Dialectical reading is now about your specific grappling with specific subject matters and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">your ability to actually work with complicated information, not just concentrate, but work with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.620</a></span> | <span class="t">complicated information.

I envision a future where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1676" target="_blank">00:27:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I live close to family, grow my own food, work from home, and have time for painting. However,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1681" target="_blank">00:28:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">job opportunities in my animation industry are dwindling, especially remote work. Should I change</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1687" target="_blank">00:28:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">careers to achieve my ideal lifestyle? I feel like it's our second animation question in a few weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1693" target="_blank">00:28:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It's interesting. I wonder if that's quite a coincidence. I'm reading a book on another Disney</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1698" target="_blank">00:28:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">book right now, and it's talking about the period where they get CalArts up and running. So this was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1703" target="_blank">00:28:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">basically like the training camp that Disney helped fund to help generate new animators. So I know more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1710" target="_blank">00:28:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">about animation than I probably should. All right, but Anna, this is not about animation when you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1714" target="_blank">00:28:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">asking a question about lifestyle-centric planning. So first of all, I love the approach you're taking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1718" target="_blank">00:28:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">here. This is classic LCP. You have an ideal lifestyle vision in mind, and now you're working</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1724" target="_blank">00:28:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">backwards from that vision to saying, how can I actually make this possible? So when you're working</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1729" target="_blank">00:28:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">backwards from a lifestyle vision, the things that matter typically is going to fall into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">categories of obstacles and opportunities. What are the obstacles in the way for me getting where I am</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1738" target="_blank">00:28:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">right now to something closer to that ideal lifestyle? The opportunities are, what can I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1743" target="_blank">00:29:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">leverage? What type of like unique setup? This could be like career capital or family connection or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1748" target="_blank">00:29:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever. What opportunities do I have to leverage as well? So you want to systematically work at reducing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1753" target="_blank">00:29:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">or bypassing obstacles while taking advantage of everything that you have, all the opportunities you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1758" target="_blank">00:29:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">have as well. So that's probably the right thing to do here. The key obstacle in this analysis is you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">seeing the particular types of jobs you have in the animation industry is not remote work friendly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1769" target="_blank">00:29:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and your lifestyle vision, when you work backwards from it, remote work really makes that work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1774" target="_blank">00:29:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? Because if you can be in a lower cost of living place, you could be at home and growing food</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1780" target="_blank">00:29:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and be near family and maybe not need to work as many hours because where you're living is less</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1784" target="_blank">00:29:44.340</a></span> | <span class="t">expensive. If instead of being, you know, near Burbank or Disney is, you're instead, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1789" target="_blank">00:29:49.300</a></span> | <span class="t">where you grew up in Indiana, it's going to be cheaper to live. Like remote work seems to be at the core</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1793" target="_blank">00:29:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of it. So there's a key obstacle here. If your current job trajectory isn't making that possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1798" target="_blank">00:29:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So now you know what you're doing. Oh, I am systematically exploring and looking for insight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1803" target="_blank">00:30:03.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It might not be obvious, but I'm looking for a moment of insight about how do I reduce that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1806" target="_blank">00:30:06.940</a></span> | <span class="t">obstacle? That's probably going to come from leveraging the opportunity of the various skills</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1811" target="_blank">00:30:11.020</a></span> | <span class="t">you have and looking for adjacent applications. So like, sure, maybe if I want to be in like feature</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1815" target="_blank">00:30:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">motion picture animation, there's like three options. They're all based in California and they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1819" target="_blank">00:30:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">cutting back and there's not remote work options, but maybe there's an adjacent step here. Actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1823" target="_blank">00:30:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">this graphic skills I have could be used, maybe not in like feature film, whatever animation, but it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1830" target="_blank">00:30:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">could be used in whatever game development, object design, or in certain types of advertising or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1836" target="_blank">00:30:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">something. There's there. I find that adjacent field where it's very useful. And now I have taken</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1843" target="_blank">00:30:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">an opportunity and gone around an obstacle. So it's not easy, but it's specific. That's what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1848" target="_blank">00:30:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">key about LCP is that it's very specific what you're doing here. I have this obstacle. I'm enumerating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1853" target="_blank">00:30:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">my opportunities. The only piece of like semi-advanced advice I would give is that if you're stuck,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1859" target="_blank">00:30:59.700</a></span> | <span class="t">A, keep searching for ideas and inspiration, talk to people, read things, listen to things. You're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">looking for that path. It could be narrow, but you're looking for the path that gets you closer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Increasing the opportunity side is often a low hanging fruit that can make a big difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1873" target="_blank">00:31:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And that might mean learning a new skill, a relevant skill. I know how to do this. What if I learned how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1879" target="_blank">00:31:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to do this, which is someone who already knows how to do this first thing would have an easier time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1883" target="_blank">00:31:23.140</a></span> | <span class="t">learning it, like looking for these adjacent skills that if you learned would open up new opportunities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1887" target="_blank">00:31:27.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're kind of playing a game here, but you're thinking about it the right way. You have a lifestyle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1892" target="_blank">00:31:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">in mind. You're trying to work backwards from it. So, so you're doing the right thing and don't be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1896" target="_blank">00:31:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">frustrated if it takes a while to finally find that path. Also, I'll throw in one more coda.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1901" target="_blank">00:31:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you know, you know what you want your, your ideal lifestyle. You can isolate some of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1907" target="_blank">00:31:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">general properties here, like a little bit more of a slowness, a connection back to nature when you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1912" target="_blank">00:31:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">growing your food connection to community. Keep in mind, even while you're looking for a larger</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1917" target="_blank">00:31:57.540</a></span> | <span class="t">reconfiguration to get to your full ideal lifestyle, you could be making changes to your life as it exists</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1923" target="_blank">00:32:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">now to have more of those properties.

Uh, you're more community involved where you live, even if you can't be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1954" target="_blank">00:32:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">closer to family, play with these things you're identifying as important and start getting them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1960" target="_blank">00:32:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">in your life. Now, don't let perfect be the enemy of better. And that's like a key thing with LCP is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1967" target="_blank">00:32:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that it's not just until I'm living on the houseboat, I'm in trouble. It's what is it I'm identifying as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1973" target="_blank">00:32:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">important? Let's keep adding this to my life. And actually that might open up other ideas for how to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1976" target="_blank">00:32:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">get there. So anyways, uh, good luck with that, but thanks for the good LCP example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=1981" target="_blank">00:33:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.

Actually, most of the computer science I know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=2231" target="_blank">00:37:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">are cool, but programmers aren't always.

I work at a national nonprofit. Um, I think what you should do, and I think the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=2253" target="_blank">00:37:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the lawyers will back me up is you want to, uh, sort people into different like demographic groups</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=2259" target="_blank">00:37:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and then just pay your favored groups more is probably like, so if you like the country they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=2263" target="_blank">00:37:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">from, pay them more than no.

Um, no, there is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=2277" target="_blank">00:37:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so it is tricky, uh, performance-based review there. I wrote a New Yorker piece back in the pandemic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=2282" target="_blank">00:38:02.540</a></span> | <span class="t">from, there is a system called ROE, R-O-W-E, results-oriented workplace environment. And there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=2289" target="_blank">00:38:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a book about this that's called something like work, like work doesn't have to suck or something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=2294" target="_blank">00:38:14.940</a></span> | <span class="t">like that.

It's fascinating. It is a attempt to rebuild an office. If you apply the ROE methodology,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=2305" target="_blank">00:38:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you rebuild your office entirely around results is all that matters.

And you kind of have like this portfolio of projects that you do and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=2328" target="_blank">00:38:48.860</a></span> | <span class="t">you're held accountable to it.

But the point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=2334" target="_blank">00:38:54.100</a></span> | <span class="t">of this article is it's very hard to implement it. And honestly, the big issue they have, and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=2339" target="_blank">00:38:59.780</a></span> | <span class="t">interviewed the, the, one of the creators of it and I read the book and talked to a CEO of a company</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=2343" target="_blank">00:39:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that uses this methodology.

They're giving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3314" target="_blank">00:55:14.060</a></span> | <span class="t">incredibly vague language and a lot of journalists are just repeating this language. So like OpenAI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3319" target="_blank">00:55:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">when they talk about their new models, they say, uh, the new models, they, they slow down to think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3325" target="_blank">00:55:25.500</a></span> | <span class="t">more and that's how they're reasoning. And this is the way it's being reported in like mainstream</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3331" target="_blank">00:55:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">journalism.

What does that mean? Right? Like Jesse, when you think about like a model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3349" target="_blank">00:55:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">like slowing down and thinking like, what does that mean?

This is an idea</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3375" target="_blank">00:56:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">from the academic community, studying language models, 2022, you get this paper that says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3379" target="_blank">00:56:19.500</a></span> | <span class="t">if you want to increase the reasoning performance of language models,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3384" target="_blank">00:56:24.460</a></span> | <span class="t">you should use something called chain of thought prompting, C O T prompting.

And what happened is this would give you better answers because language models, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3419" target="_blank">00:56:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">are there, they're trained to, um, expand text in predictable ways. They're trained on taking real text,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3425" target="_blank">00:57:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">taking words or sequence of words out of them and having the language models, try to fill those in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3429" target="_blank">00:57:09.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And the closer they get to real words there, like the, the more they get rewarded in their training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3433" target="_blank">00:57:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So like what was happening is you would give a language model, like a logic problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3438" target="_blank">00:57:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, Jesse has this many apples and then someone comes along and takes this many apples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3442" target="_blank">00:57:22.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the person who's taller gives you back this many apples.

Like that's a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3455" target="_blank">00:57:35.900</a></span> | <span class="t">for our language models perspective, that looks like, like a reasonable response to this prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3461" target="_blank">00:57:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's talking about Jesse.

When it walks through its reasoning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3478" target="_blank">00:57:58.460</a></span> | <span class="t">in the answer, it's more likely to get the correct answer because, um, as it fills out its reasoning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3483" target="_blank">00:58:03.820</a></span> | <span class="t">it's actually accessing relevant circuits that do different parts of the reasoning. And it's actually more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3489" target="_blank">00:58:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">likely, you're more likely to activate like the relevant circuits that can do the different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3493" target="_blank">00:58:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">calculations and put them together in the right way.

Okay. So the issue is now we get, uh, chat bots and they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3503" target="_blank">00:58:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">getting popular. We really can't rely on prompt engineering as something that like the average</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3508" target="_blank">00:58:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">user is going to do, right?

Researchers were doing this, but we can't expect the users to do this. So what seems to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3527" target="_blank">00:58:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">happened is they said, can we basically use reinforcement learning to kind of force one of these models to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3534" target="_blank">00:58:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">always act as if it's being prompted to show its work? Right? So this is the key. And I'm not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3540" target="_blank">00:59:00.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll just be incredibly brief on this, but like the, the, the key that got like the original chat GPT so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3545" target="_blank">00:59:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">much notice is they took the first really large, large language model with was GPT-3, which could do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3551" target="_blank">00:59:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">amazing stuff, but you really had to write incredibly careful prompts to get it. And the big innovation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3556" target="_blank">00:59:16.940</a></span> | <span class="t">second innovation open AI had the first being just make the model large was this thing called, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3561" target="_blank">00:59:21.740</a></span> | <span class="t">we think of it as like re a reinforcement learning based fine tuning, where they took this model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3566" target="_blank">00:59:26.300</a></span> | <span class="t">that had all this knowledge in it.

And every time it gave like a good type of answer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3576" target="_blank">00:59:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">they would zap it with a happy zap. And it was sort of like, Ooh, whatever weights we were using here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3581" target="_blank">00:59:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">let's make those stronger. And whenever it gave an answer that was, they didn't like, they would give it a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3585" target="_blank">00:59:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">a, an unhappy bad person's app. And it would be like, Ooh, let's kind of reduce some of these weights</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3589" target="_blank">00:59:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that gave us this answer. And so for like chat GPT, they were saying, we're going to run,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3594" target="_blank">00:59:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">we train GPT-3 and we're going to run a bunch of prompts. And when you answer this, like, uh, an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3599" target="_blank">00:59:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">agent that you're chatting with a human, we're going to give you a happy zap. And then, so it got good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3604" target="_blank">01:00:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">at answering questions without you having to write really careful prompts. I think what is happening,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3609" target="_blank">01:00:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">according to my source is that they're just doing this now for chain of thought reasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3612" target="_blank">01:00:12.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So they take one of these models, they'll, they train it up the old fashioned, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3616" target="_blank">01:00:16.700</a></span> | <span class="t">with all the, all the texts on the internet and just like any of these other models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3620" target="_blank">01:00:20.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And then as they start running through answers to it, giving it questions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3624" target="_blank">01:00:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">when it shows more of its work, they give it a happy zap.

And every time it gives a bad answer, they zap it. And then like over time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3654" target="_blank">01:00:54.940</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like, I'm not going to give those type of answers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3656" target="_blank">01:00:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is what I believe the reasoning models have done is they take a standard big train model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3662" target="_blank">01:01:02.700</a></span> | <span class="t">and then they do a reinforcement fine tuning step where they're saying, show your work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3666" target="_blank">01:01:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">show your work, show your work, give us big, long answers.

It's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3688" target="_blank">01:01:28.140</a></span> | <span class="t">what's really happening is the, the chat bot is giving this like incredibly long</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3691" target="_blank">01:01:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">explanation for its answer, which helps the accuracy of it. But the explanation is so long</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3696" target="_blank">01:01:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">that if you're a user who asked a question, you're like, oh my God, I don't want to see all of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3700" target="_blank">01:01:40.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're, they're hiding a lot of that. And we know this because, uh, if you actually look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3705" target="_blank">01:01:45.820</a></span> | <span class="t">user agreements, what's happening now, if you use these reasoning bots is they say, don't just count</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3710" target="_blank">01:01:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">the tokens that you see. There's something called hidden tokens that it generated part of its answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3717" target="_blank">01:01:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">that we're hiding from you and the user, because you don't need to see all that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3720" target="_blank">01:02:00.300</a></span> | <span class="t">that, but we have to charge you for it. Like, I mean, it produced all of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3723" target="_blank">01:02:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can kind of quantify that, oh, they are generating these really long answers and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3727" target="_blank">01:02:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">they're hiding a lot of it. So that like what you see is just some of the steps and then you get the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3731" target="_blank">01:02:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">final answer. So that's what reasoning is. It's not thinking slower. The reason why it takes longer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3738" target="_blank">01:02:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">is that it's just generating a much longer answer, right? That's what the slower is. Like when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3743" target="_blank">01:02:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">see, you know, you see this when you use chat GPT, you know, it takes a lot, each token they produce,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3748" target="_blank">01:02:28.460</a></span> | <span class="t">chat GPT still produces token by token. Deep seek is a gains efficiency by doing a few words at a time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3754" target="_blank">01:02:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">but you notice how the words like come in one by one. It's because for every one of these things they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3759" target="_blank">01:02:39.100</a></span> | <span class="t">generating, you have 500 billion parameter, uh, transformer-based model pushing through to generate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3765" target="_blank">01:02:45.500</a></span> | <span class="t">just that word. So it takes longer to generate these reasoning model answers because what it's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3770" target="_blank">01:02:50.700</a></span> | <span class="t">doing is writing like pages of explanation all the way up until its final answer. It just takes a long</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3777" target="_blank">01:02:57.740</a></span> | <span class="t">time to do all that. They don't show you all that work, but that's what the slowness is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3782" target="_blank">01:03:02.620</a></span> | <span class="t">is it's just giving really long answers. So that's what reasoning is. Um, it is different than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3788" target="_blank">01:03:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">when I talked around the New Yorker last year about planning and how language models can't plan. And they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3793" target="_blank">01:03:13.340</a></span> | <span class="t">said, ultimately what language models will need to be, uh, flexible planners is planning engines outside</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3799" target="_blank">01:03:19.340</a></span> | <span class="t">of the language model. And it like you, and you need some sort of coordinator that is going to, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3805" target="_blank">01:03:25.500</a></span> | <span class="t">talk to a language model and talk to a planning engine. The canonical example is like playing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3809" target="_blank">01:03:29.980</a></span> | <span class="t">chess against an AI bot. Like ultimately you can't just have a giant neural network that can, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3815" target="_blank">01:03:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">be hard coded to, to look ahead a hundred thousand possible moves because that's just too big of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3821" target="_blank">01:03:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">neural network to hard code. You, you, you need some sort of like systematic simulator to check those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3825" target="_blank">01:03:45.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And then maybe like the neural network to look at its quality, et cetera. So I still think there's only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3830" target="_blank">01:03:50.940</a></span> | <span class="t">so much, this helps answers. It's, it's not the, the really sophisticated how from 2001 style</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3837" target="_blank">01:03:57.340</a></span> | <span class="t">reasoning is going to require non language model components that can actually recurse and do loops</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3843" target="_blank">01:04:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">and have state and actually explore things more systematically. But that is what I think is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3847" target="_blank">01:04:07.020</a></span> | <span class="t">on with reasoning. It's the same language models based on the same type of original training that we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3852" target="_blank">01:04:12.300</a></span> | <span class="t">seen recently. These big 500 billion parameter models, plus reinforcement learning that gets it to show its</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3858" target="_blank">01:04:18.940</a></span> | <span class="t">work. And when language models show their work for certain types of problems, they're more likely to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3863" target="_blank">01:04:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">be accurate. So that is what is going on. I can't find this explanation in almost any common press</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3868" target="_blank">01:04:28.060</a></span> | <span class="t">article about this, but I think that is what is really happening. All right. So I can't help myself,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3872" target="_blank">01:04:32.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesse, but there we go. Are you going to write an article about it? I mean, it's not really like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3877" target="_blank">01:04:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">New Yorker article. I don't know. This is more of like a science, like a tech explanation article.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3882" target="_blank">01:04:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You did a chat GPT article, didn't you? I've done some. Yeah. It's kind of boring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3887" target="_blank">01:04:47.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So I'm making you guys listen to this instead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3890" target="_blank">01:04:50.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's interesting. I'm just kind of frustrated that none of like the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3895" target="_blank">01:04:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">the, the people who write the tech explainer articles, all the big names,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3898" target="_blank">01:04:58.220</a></span> | <span class="t">they're all just falling back on this. It's just taking time to think more. And that's how the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3902" target="_blank">01:05:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">reasoning works. It's like, well, let's like actually understand, like, is there something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3906" target="_blank">01:05:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">is there a new architecture? Is there a new technology? Like what's happening?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3909" target="_blank">01:05:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I had to read academic papers to try to just get that explanation. I think that's what's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3913" target="_blank">01:05:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">on. All right. Well, speaking of slowing down, I think that's all the time we have for today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqNEM-P5vN8&t=3917" target="_blank">01:05:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">but we'll be back next week with another episode.
