I mean, just to, I guess, put this in perspective, I think a gigawatt,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-o5YbNfmh0&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like around the size of like a meaningful nuclear power plant only going towards training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-o5YbNfmh0&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a model. And then you run into these things that just end up being slower in the world, like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-o5YbNfmh0&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">getting energy permitted is like a very heavily regulated government function. And if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-o5YbNfmh0&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about building large new power plants or large build-outs and then building transmission</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-o5YbNfmh0&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">lines that cross other private or public land, that is just a heavily regulated thing. So you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-o5YbNfmh0&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about many years of lead time. So if we wanted to stand up just some massive facility</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-o5YbNfmh0&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to power that, I think that that's a very long-term project. I think we would probably build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-o5YbNfmh0&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">out bigger clusters than we currently can if we could get the energy to do it. So I think that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-o5YbNfmh0&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">fundamentally money bottlenecked in the limit.

But it depends on how far the exponential curves go, right? Like I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-o5YbNfmh0&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">a number of companies are working on, you know, right now I think a lot of data centers are on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-o5YbNfmh0&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the order of 50 megawatts or a hundred megawatts, or like a big one might be 150 megawatts. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-o5YbNfmh0&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So you take a whole data center and you fill it up with just all the stuff that you need to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-o5YbNfmh0&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">for training and you build the biggest cluster you can. I think that's kind of, I think a bunch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-o5YbNfmh0&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of companies are running at stuff like that. But then when you start getting into building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-o5YbNfmh0&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a data center, that's like 300 megawatts or 500 megawatts or a gigawatt. I just, I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-o5YbNfmh0&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">just no one has built a single gigawatt data center yet. So I think it will happen, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-o5YbNfmh0&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, this is only a matter of time, but it's not going to be like next year.

Right. In general, you know, in history, you hit bottlenecks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-o5YbNfmh0&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">at certain points.
