But when people hear justice, I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">There's something there's something that feels judgmental about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There's something that feels moralistic about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.300</a></span> | <span class="t">There's something that feels, I don't know, political about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.

the reason I thought it would sort of be off to the slowest start is I felt like it had a sort of a strong tailwind against it, which is why I was interested in writing about it and why I think it's important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But I wanted to I wanted to I wanted to take justice sort of down a few pegs and make it something much more practical and accessible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">The sort of standards by which one lives and holds themselves to as as as much more a way of life than like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">These, as you know, in academia, like justice as as a field of study is often about these really esoteric or abstract questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And and and the more you study justice, almost like the less actual understanding you get of it, like you start to doubt whether it exists at all and whether it matters at all or whether whether it's possible at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's just strikes me as so opposed to the idea of like, like, are you a person who keeps your word?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Are you a person who's honest?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Are you a person who treats other people?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, are you a principled person?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Are you a person who makes the world better for you being in it that that to me being just a much more practical and yet also aspirational idea of justice?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I think people often leave this out of their conception of what they're trying to do with their life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I often use the terminology code in the sense of what's your code, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And somewhere that should be written down and it's going to change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.060</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to evolve, of course, but that without that foundation, it's like not having to keel in the boat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so then the winds are going to be blowing you all over the place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Why do you think why do you think this is something that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">In today's moment, because I think 100 years ago, like this is the starting point is like, what is your code?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You could you could specify those principles like in your sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Why is this something that is a surprise to people or something we have to push people to consider in our current moment?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, looking at much more homogenous, even top down society, we all agree or are forced to agree with certain definitions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So if we all share the same religion, Christianity at one point has the same cardinal virtues as stoicism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we all believe in the same God or if we all accept or are forced to accept even the same definition of, say, like masculinity or femininity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. Then then then the virtues of what a man or a woman is, is very clear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">How one should behave is very clear. The sort of religious tenets are very clear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So so it's easier to go like, hey, this is what is right and wrong without feeling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">With that with like what happens when you live in a much more pluralistic society, which I think is a wonderful thing, is that suddenly your definition of right and wrong is not shared by everyone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So then we have to have this sensitivity and not wanting to say, hey, don't do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, that's bad. Leave those people alone again, all positive things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But it has partly the effect, I think, of making it harder and harder to give people strong advice or a strong sort of culture that enforces or celebrates a kind of a code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, like the the the relative relativism of society is a generally, I would say, a positive thing because it's more tolerant, which is a virtue of justice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But it makes it hard to just go, hey, that's a bad thing to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the wrong thing to do. So I think what you end up with is a system, a culture that doesn't teach these values early on or or even more confusingly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">it holds up some of the old stories of the past that we used to use to sort of reinforce and inspire and it just pokes the holes in them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So if you if you only look at the founding fathers or you only look at the ancients and you look at all the thing, all the ways that they were hypocrites, all the terrible things they did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, it has this effect of sort of just confusing one's definition of justice without giving anyone really a code to replace it with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So let's say I'm twenty five. Right. All right. I'm coming out hot out of college.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I sort of have some professional ambitions. I've been listening to some Huberman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've got some physical protocols nailed down, but I don't come from a religious background.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a generic yearning that I need some sort of code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I need some sort of stability to live by. Where do they start?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. You know, I think that space is a really interesting one because you're right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a whole bunch of sort of thought leaders and information and books and stuff out there that's like, here's how to get stronger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's how to get faster. Here's how to get smarter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, those are kind of the the the other virtues. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">This is courage and discipline and wisdom. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if you don't have this other component, this code, this sense of right and wrong, what you do and don't do, how you treat people, what you allow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Really what you see and you see with some of those people is like the algorithm kind of takes over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. What your ambition becomes the thing that guides you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So what's ever best for your career is what you do as opposed to, you know, what you feel like is OK or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think you and I have probably both experienced this where there's.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">There are all sorts of decisions that you get faced with that, hey, what's going to grow my YouTube following the most?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What's going to sell the most books?

Like I just didn't want a regular life. And, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I was studying writing and political science and I had this chance I, uh, to, to work in Hollywood and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">had a chance to be a research assistant for, for a writer named Robert Green. And it just struck me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that, Hey, to, to be a writer, what was a better way to learn how to do that?

So I ended up sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of making that leap and, you know, it was, it was sort of scary and terrifying in a lot of ways. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but, but I, I just, I just had this sense that someone had given me this piece of advice. They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">said, writers live interesting lives, which, uh, I I've thought about a lot since. And I was just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking like, yeah, like, okay, let's say I just get my, get my normal degree and graduate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Who's going to, who's going to publish my writing?

I'll just be like literally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">every other student who is graduating. I had about a year, a year and a half left in college.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I would just be like everyone else. I would be at the exact same point I was then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">except for, I would have foregone this experience to actually study under someone who was doing the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">thing. And so I just went and did that. And it was, you know, it was, it was a, it was a surreal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">experience in a bunch of ways. I learned a bunch of stuff, but, but mostly I was just trying to like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">go toward like, go, go as directly as I could towards like real world experience. And then also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">do some, do the unusual or unexpected thing. Did you see the position with green specifically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1141" target="_blank">00:19:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">aiming towards your interest in writing and the Hollywood position as a mix of, I want to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">something interesting. And also what's the thing that is going to be an income source that, how did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1151" target="_blank">00:19:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you see those are two, because Hollywood in that position kind of is the epitome of office politics</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1157" target="_blank">00:19:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and being in an office and like arbitrariness or whatever. So I, I mean, I love the complexities</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">when we dig into like the reality of these stories. So like what role did the Hollywood piece play in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that? You're working for an agency, right? Yeah. I worked at a talent management agency. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like when I was growing up as a kid and just had this sense that I didn't want to work in an office,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think I was thinking office space, not like a talent agency in Beverly Hills, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1182" target="_blank">00:19:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like it was, it, an office is still an office ultimately. And you realize that pretty quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But, and a job is always a job, but, but it felt different and exciting and unusual and certainly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1195" target="_blank">00:19:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">far outside my, my ordinary experiences. But I think it's funny. I remember, I remember two things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1204" target="_blank">00:20:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">about it. So, so I'd wanted to work for Robert. I don't think I would have dropped out of college</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1208" target="_blank">00:20:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">just to work for Robert. I don't know if I would have had the courage to do that. So then when I got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1212" target="_blank">00:20:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">offered to, to be the assistant to this, you know, sort of big movie producer, um, who again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">who was also someone who was doing the thing, he wasn't, you know, coming up with the scripts or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1221" target="_blank">00:20:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever himself, but he was making stuff. So, so I, again, it was another doer, but I remember he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1227" target="_blank">00:20:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">offered me $30,000. And I remember thinking, wow, what am I going to do with all of that money?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1234" target="_blank">00:20:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, like, it just seemed like an insane amount of money to me at the time, uh, because my,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, my expenses were nothing. I wasn't married. I didn't have kids. Like my apartment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">was probably $800 a month. Um, and, and so I just kind of went towards doing this crazy, unusual thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that would kind of introduce me to a world I knew nothing about, but there was this safety net of like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1259" target="_blank">00:20:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, I had a paycheck. I think when, when people tell me, Oh, I'm thinking about dropping out of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">college. I, I always go like to do what, not like, what are you aspiring to do, but what are you dropping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">out for? Like, I think it's very failing out of college is, or, or quitting your job is very different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1279" target="_blank">00:21:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">than, uh, leaving college to go do a different thing. Like if you have lined something else up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1286" target="_blank">00:21:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and you are, you are jumping from one ship to another, to me, that's very different than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1292" target="_blank">00:21:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">what often happens, which is your heart's not in a thing and you're not very good at a thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you fail at it or you, you bounce out of it. That's, that's a riskier proposition in my view.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1305" target="_blank">00:21:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So then I see you now. Okay. During this stage, you, you're working with Roberts. You're learning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1310" target="_blank">00:21:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">about writing. You have the Hollywood job. It's paying the bills. It's interesting in its own right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1314" target="_blank">00:21:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I imagine a young Ryan holiday basically surveying the horizon. Okay. I'm looking for,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">where can I make my move? Uh, marketing became that first move. Um, so not just how did that happen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but how were you thinking about those initial opportunities to fall into marketing when it did occur?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1331" target="_blank">00:22:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it's funny. So when I was at this talent agency, I, I signed this kid, he was like 16 and he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">was like uploading these YouTube videos. And it was like the first sort of YouTube person that, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">really any of the agencies had signed. It was like pretty new. And it's funny. Um, he, he didn't end up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1350" target="_blank">00:22:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">going anywhere. And then just like, he's blown up, like in the last, like six months, like this person,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1356" target="_blank">00:22:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">he's like middle-aged now. He's like 30 years. I think he's like, I mean, he must be like, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1361" target="_blank">00:22:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">early thirties.

It was just a young,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1366" target="_blank">00:22:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I wish I wish. Uh, uh, but, but anyways, it was, it was funny to watch like the actual development cycle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of something. Like I thought this guy was like the next big thing. And actually, you know, it was more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1379" target="_blank">00:22:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like 15 years later, he would be a big thing. And I, I think I probably realized pretty early on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1385" target="_blank">00:23:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I just didn't have the patience, uh, to operate in that world.

So, uh, what, what ended up happening is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Robert green, who I was working for happened to be on the board of directors at American apparel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I was sort of learning all this stuff and he got me, you know, in the door there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And I, I went and I, I did marketing there and then I worked for a bunch of different authors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1416" target="_blank">00:23:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I sort of built this marketing business. What, what I think I was going towards is, is I understood</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1422" target="_blank">00:23:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that creating stuff and selling stuff was two very different skills, but the best artists and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">athletes and entrepreneurs and creatives are able to do both of those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1437" target="_blank">00:23:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so like, did you know that when you took that marketing job, were you thinking I've seen enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1444" target="_blank">00:24:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in my agency position to know that this is really important and, uh, me mastering this as I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1451" target="_blank">00:24:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to apply this to myself. Like this is. Yeah. I think, I think I was always going towards applying this to my own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1457" target="_blank">00:24:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff, uh, how, how, how, how explicit that was developed over time. But I think I understood that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like, look, anyone can have ideas, but it's only the people who know how to sell the ideas that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1471" target="_blank">00:24:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">have that are able to, to sort of break through. And so I, I spent, yeah, a good chunk of my twenties.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1478" target="_blank">00:24:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, really just learning the ins and outs of that. And, and what happened is that helping people do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1485" target="_blank">00:24:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that gave me a lot of, first off, I built a lot of relationships, but second, I built a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1491" target="_blank">00:24:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">experience and got a lot of reps. So like when my first book came out, it was not the first book that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1498" target="_blank">00:24:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I had put out.

So by the time you were doing your first book, you actually like your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">first, let's call it real book. It wasn't your first real book. And that is a, a really invaluable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">thing because you know, if, if you're a director of them, like how many movies is even a great director</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1521" target="_blank">00:25:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">do in their life? And it might be three movies. And so if you don't have any experience working on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1529" target="_blank">00:25:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">other people's projects, you're going to be learning all your painful lessons on your own projects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1536" target="_blank">00:25:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. And what if, what if what you learn is, oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1541" target="_blank">00:25:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">if you title the thing wrong, or if you time the thing wrong, it fails. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1546" target="_blank">00:25:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">do you want to learn that on your project or would you rather learn it on somebody else's project?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1551" target="_blank">00:25:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I got a lot of experience and, and that experience continued up until relatively recently,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like on other projects, I was just learn. I got, I have so many more reps. I've done a lot of books</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">myself under my own name, but I have more reps on putting out books than like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1570" target="_blank">00:26:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">basically any author you could think of.

So many times the, the analogy that comes to mind from the movie world is James</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1579" target="_blank">00:26:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Cameron, uh, working in, uh, Roger Corman's sort of shop, uh, special effects, second unit directing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1587" target="_blank">00:26:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">took over the special effects shot.

He had a lot of experience with work with the cameras. So in your own story,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1602" target="_blank">00:26:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">getting to your first book, um, I know you went on to work with Tim Ferriss. I know you went on to work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1607" target="_blank">00:26:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">for Tucker Max on the marketing side.

So there's, or these are all overlapped, but overlapping same time. Uh, and, and a lot of it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1628" target="_blank">00:27:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">before. And then, but yeah, by the time obstacle came out, you know, I'd done a lot of books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1633" target="_blank">00:27:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">What made you, how'd you pull the trigger? So you knew you wanted to write, you're looking for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1638" target="_blank">00:27:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">opportunity, right? Yeah. And by the way, I'm an answer to the question of how could, who would,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1642" target="_blank">00:27:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">who would want to publish someone just coming out of college? What I found out was the only answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1646" target="_blank">00:27:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to that question. And I actually talked to agents and was like, how could I possibly thread this needle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1652" target="_blank">00:27:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">as a 21 year old and get a book deal? And they basically said, the only way you could possibly do this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1657" target="_blank">00:27:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is if you're writing about students for students, right? So basically you were right in the sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1661" target="_blank">00:27:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that the only way at that age, like right out of college to get published, the only way to do that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1666" target="_blank">00:27:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in nonfiction was to basically do what I did, which was I can write, uh, how to become a straight A</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1671" target="_blank">00:27:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">student or how to win at college. Like that was the way in. So you were probably right there. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1675" target="_blank">00:27:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">but these years go by, what was it that made you pull the trigger on trust me, I'm lying.

And the idea was this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1861" target="_blank">00:31:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">would catch attention. And it did, I guess for the blogging world, they're like, that's so much money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1865" target="_blank">00:31:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">What's going on. What is this kid? Uh, and it was reported as like, that was you had wildly inflated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1870" target="_blank">00:31:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it or something. Did you, is that right? Did you plant that story and was that inflated or was that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1875" target="_blank">00:31:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">not? It's funny. Now we look back, it's like, that's not a crazy advance, but in the world of blogging in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1880" target="_blank">00:31:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like 2012, it was like, no one has ever made that much money in books before. What is the story of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1885" target="_blank">00:31:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">galley cat leak? So what, so what actually happened was, um, one of the things I talked about in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1890" target="_blank">00:31:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">book, uh, that you sort of realize in marketing is that nobody fact checks press releases. You can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1897" target="_blank">00:31:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">basically claim anything you want in a press release and people will pick it up. And then once it's picked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1902" target="_blank">00:31:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">up, then other people will pick up that somebody else has picked it up and it becomes real, right? You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1908" target="_blank">00:31:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">don't realize that what you're seeing on social media is, uh, traced back to a press release,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1915" target="_blank">00:31:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">which costs $49 to go out over the wire, which isn't even a thing anymore. The wires usually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1922" target="_blank">00:32:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, previously having been actual telegraph wire. So I was making this point that, that so much of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1928" target="_blank">00:32:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">our news comes from these very flimsy or if outright false stories, uh, sources or susceptible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1934" target="_blank">00:32:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">sources. So what, what, what had actually happened is I, I gotten like 200 or 250 for the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1942" target="_blank">00:32:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, uh, which is a lot of money then, and this is even a lot of money now. Um, but what I decided</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1948" target="_blank">00:32:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I would do is I would just, I would, I would announce that it was like 500. I think I announced</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1953" target="_blank">00:32:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it was 500 or I may have even just like hinted that it was 500. There's like these weird for people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1959" target="_blank">00:32:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">who don't know, there's these weird terms when you announce a deal in the, in the trades in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1964" target="_blank">00:32:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in, in very good, good. It's a very good deal. It's a super deal. And, and these,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1969" target="_blank">00:32:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">these mean like a band of advances. So I forget exactly what happened, but the point was, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1974" target="_blank">00:32:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I, I put out a press release implying that it was a $500,000 advance, which then got picked up by,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1982" target="_blank">00:33:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, what was then sort of an industry blog called the galley cat. I don't think it exists anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1986" target="_blank">00:33:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, so they reported that, you know, Hey, this kid you've never heard of who's 24 years old and has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1993" target="_blank">00:33:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">never written anything before, just got a $500,000 advance. That was sort of the whoa. And then, so what I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=1999" target="_blank">00:33:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">what I did was, uh, then I, I emailed that to a bunch of gossip websites. Um, and, and I said, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2010" target="_blank">00:33:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">did you see that this kid got 500,000, a $500,000 advance if the old, I said something like the only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2017" target="_blank">00:33:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">way someone would pay this much money is if it's some kind of celebrity tell all. So this kid must,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2024" target="_blank">00:33:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">must be spilling, you know, a bunch of, of, of, of gossip about all these famous people that he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2029" target="_blank">00:33:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">worked for. And then, so that got picked up in other places that it was this celebrity guy. So just to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2036" target="_blank">00:33:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">clear, uh, so people, the, the purpose of this was to make the meta point that there, is there some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2044" target="_blank">00:34:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">self-promotional benefit to doing so? Yes. But I wasn't just doing it because I wanted to be famous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2048" target="_blank">00:34:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">There wasn't even like social media to benefit from at this point. Uh, I, I was making this point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2054" target="_blank">00:34:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to show that, uh, one, I, I, I actually, I was writing a book about media manipulation. So I wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2062" target="_blank">00:34:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to show how media manipulation actually works like with the book itself. And I was trying to make the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2067" target="_blank">00:34:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">point that, um, this is, this is how information that you consume on a daily basis. This is how it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2075" target="_blank">00:34:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">happens. Like this is how these rumors get started. And so it, it, it worked in the sense that people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2082" target="_blank">00:34:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">picked it up. And then in the book, I described how I had done this with the book that the people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2088" target="_blank">00:34:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">were then reading. So I, I was trying to, I was trying to take it. I was trying to expose certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2093" target="_blank">00:34:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">loopholes in, uh, how the media system worked. So I'm interested in the, the upcoming transition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2099" target="_blank">00:34:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in your career story. I see this as phase one before the stoic phase, right? Um, so you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2105" target="_blank">00:35:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you have this book come out at this point, you've sort of incorporated your own company. At this point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2110" target="_blank">00:35:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">brass check was a, an entity or your, uh, marketing company. Um, around this time too, you did, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2116" target="_blank">00:35:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it was just a digital original growth hack, growth hacker marketing. So I'm assuming at this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2122" target="_blank">00:35:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">point, if we interviewed you, you had a vision, uh, what was that vision for like your next five to 10</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2129" target="_blank">00:35:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">years? Was it at this point, a successful marketing company writing books to help the company? Is it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2136" target="_blank">00:35:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to be writing about marketing and I'm going to be a known writer. What is the vision like right in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2141" target="_blank">00:35:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that pre obstacle era? I think I was a little conflicted because I, I, I was very good at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2148" target="_blank">00:35:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">marketing and yet I was writing a book that was essentially making me radioactive in certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2153" target="_blank">00:35:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">marketing circles. So there, I had some elements that wanted to, to get out of it entirely. And yet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2159" target="_blank">00:35:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it had this effect of also, uh, building this sort of company and consultancy that I ended up setting up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2166" target="_blank">00:36:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, I was just, I'm just looking at this because I'm, uh, I'm doing the 10 year anniversary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2171" target="_blank">00:36:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of the obstacle is the way right now. Um, I, I sold the proposal for what was the obstacle is the way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2181" target="_blank">00:36:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like in the early fall of 2012. So just a few months after, um, trust me, I'm lying came out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2193" target="_blank">00:36:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and I think my publisher told me later, uh, Nikki Papadopoulos, who I know has worked with both</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2197" target="_blank">00:36:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of us. Uh, she told me that, you know, later they were sort of just humoring me. Like they were hoping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2203" target="_blank">00:36:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that, you know, I would do this one book and then I would go back to the marketing book. So they were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2208" target="_blank">00:36:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of happening around the same time, but, but clearly the, the aim had been to get towards, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2219" target="_blank">00:36:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">writing about philosophy. That's what I really wanted to write about. That's who I wanted to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2223" target="_blank">00:37:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">as an author. So that early, even that early, you knew, uh, it was like, trust me, I'm lying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2228" target="_blank">00:37:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Gets me in the publishing door. Yes. Right. But even that early as that book was coming out. So you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2234" target="_blank">00:37:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">working on this proposal before that book came out. Yeah. The vision you were beginning to form is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2238" target="_blank">00:37:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and maybe this was more influenced by Robert, more influenced by Tim. You were thinking, I want to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2244" target="_blank">00:37:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">not hardcore marketer. I want to be writing about, I want to be in the philosophy space. Um, yeah. What,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2251" target="_blank">00:37:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">what were the contours of that vision at this point? I mean, I know you had experienced with Tim,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2256" target="_blank">00:37:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">he had a community, he had, there's these other ancillary things around it. I mean, what he had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2262" target="_blank">00:37:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">early, not really social, but you know, he was, uh, he was doing the Ning thing and his blog was really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2267" target="_blank">00:37:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">big. Uh, how, so, so what is the, the shape of that vision then? Um, in 2012, fall of 2012.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2273" target="_blank">00:37:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I really don't know how well shaped it was. I think I looked mostly at Robert Greene,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2280" target="_blank">00:38:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">who was anomalous as a guy who wrote about big ideas in essentially at like at the level of an academic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2292" target="_blank">00:38:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but not supported by the Academy. Like he was, he's outside the system, but he is as deeply researched and,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2300" target="_blank">00:38:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">um, you know, sort of as established and, and, and, um, you know, influential as, as any academic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2309" target="_blank">00:38:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">but without that, that sort of structure around him. So I knew that was like a viable path. So I think I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2316" target="_blank">00:38:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">was mostly just thinking about that. I knew I just, I had this idea for a book about stoicism and I thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2322" target="_blank">00:38:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it could work. I mean, clearly I didn't think it would work at the level that it ended up doing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2328" target="_blank">00:38:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">or I would have demanded a lot more money than I accepted for that first book. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2332" target="_blank">00:38:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the expectations of both myself and portfolio were, were maybe mine were a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2339" target="_blank">00:38:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">bit higher than theirs, but they were both pretty muted. Um, I mean, the obstacles away sold 3000 copies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2346" target="_blank">00:39:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in its first week and, um, didn't hit a bestseller list for several years. Uh, I, I just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2356" target="_blank">00:39:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">thought it was interesting.

And it, it, it, I think as a creative runway is really important. So, um, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2920" target="_blank">00:48:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">people think, Oh, you got to move to New York.

That's just insane.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2989" target="_blank">00:49:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have roommates, you live in a bad part of town, you're just creating an environment that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=2994" target="_blank">00:49:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">don't think is going to be conducive to being and doing your best. And then also making the best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3000" target="_blank">00:50:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">long-term decisions. Yeah. So then, okay, this is fascinating. So then your final phase I see is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3007" target="_blank">00:50:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">phase where you're spending less time outside of writing, less time on marketing clients and instead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3014" target="_blank">00:50:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">build out this platform, right? So like you're, you're very associated now with a multimedia platform</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3018" target="_blank">00:50:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">surrounding stoicism. Was there a vision to that or did it unfold and you just found yourself one day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3027" target="_blank">00:50:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's a pretty big operation. I mean, I've not seen it, right? I mean, it's a pretty big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3030" target="_blank">00:50:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">operation. You've got a good amount of staff. It's, it's multiple newsletters, video, like podcast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3035" target="_blank">00:50:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">et cetera. Walk us through like how that fit into what you are trying to accomplish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3040" target="_blank">00:50:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So my agent suggested that we do this book called the daily stoic. He, he had published a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3046" target="_blank">00:50:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">number of daily books when he was at Harper Collins. Uh, this is my agent, Steve Hanselman. And, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3052" target="_blank">00:50:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I wasn't even for, honestly, it was like not even familiar with that as a type of book. I think I'd maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3058" target="_blank">00:50:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">seen one in my whole life. And when I started going through, I got really excited. It was just such a cool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3062" target="_blank">00:51:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">way to read this idea of doing one page a day. But I thought like, so what are the, what are people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3067" target="_blank">00:51:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">supposed to do? They read the one page and then they just close the book and start, start over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3071" target="_blank">00:51:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Like when they get all the way through. And it just struck me that you could build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3075" target="_blank">00:51:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">by the time someone got to the end, you had just spent a year together and that, that, that was right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3082" target="_blank">00:51:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">for a continuation. And so I agreed to write the book, but, but decided I would, I would build this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3089" target="_blank">00:51:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">thing on the back of it, this sort of page that this email a day. And I remember I paid $6,000 for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3096" target="_blank">00:51:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">daily stoic.com and we started this newsletter and yeah, I've been doing that literally every day for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3103" target="_blank">00:51:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the last eight years. Um, and it's spun off this whole thing. There's a bookstore and a podcast and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3111" target="_blank">00:51:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in multiple newsletters and social media and YouTube and all that stuff. Um, I, I would say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3117" target="_blank">00:51:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I planned it in the, in two ways. One in the sense that I thought, Hey, this is the first book you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3124" target="_blank">00:52:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">doing for which there is a continuation. Like what's a community that comes on the back of it. And then I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3131" target="_blank">00:52:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I, I, I, I, at that point my, my marketing company had, had done quite well and I'd advised a bunch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3137" target="_blank">00:52:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">different companies and individuals and public figures and authors. And, and one of the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3144" target="_blank">00:52:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that I really hated about it was that you would spend all this time coming up with these ideas and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3152" target="_blank">00:52:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">then people just wouldn't do them. Like one of the exhausting things about consulting is that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3157" target="_blank">00:52:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">realize at the end of the day, people are paying you to give them advice that they have no intention</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3165" target="_blank">00:52:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of actually using. It's like this cathartic experience for them. Yeah. But the, if they use 1% of what you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3175" target="_blank">00:52:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">come up with, that's like a success. And that just drove me nuts. It just felt like a bad use of one's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3182" target="_blank">00:53:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">creative energies. And so I just, I just, I was like, what if I just spent my energy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3190" target="_blank">00:53:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">making my own stuff and I just put the marketing energy towards that. So eventually, yeah, basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3198" target="_blank">00:53:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what happened is those two paths we were talking about that, you know, sort of finally and fully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3203" target="_blank">00:53:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">converged, you know, sometime in the last four or five years. So when you, you know, it's really grown,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3210" target="_blank">00:53:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So it grew from the email newsletter to a big YouTube investment, Instagram, um, multiple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3217" target="_blank">00:53:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">newsletters, the podcast, uh, et cetera. Right. What was the thinking behind growing it that way?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3223" target="_blank">00:53:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just realizing that most people don't read books. Yeah. And, um, if you have ideas and things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3233" target="_blank">00:53:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that you care about book to, to leave your ideas siloed in books is, um, is, is sort of stopping short.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3246" target="_blank">00:54:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So, so just the decision to say, Hey, I've, I've already done the hard work of coming up with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3252" target="_blank">00:54:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">ideas, translating this stuff into working in other mediums, uh, is not that hard. And, and weirdly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3262" target="_blank">00:54:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the economics of the other things might be much better. So, you know, you, you can make, uh, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3270" target="_blank">00:54:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a podcast might have a fraction of the audience, uh, but, but be more lucrative than a book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3278" target="_blank">00:54:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and so what I, what I, I guess what I was thinking is I love writing books. That's what I care</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3283" target="_blank">00:54:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">about. Um, that's what I want to focus the majority of my energy on, but how can I get good at explore and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3293" target="_blank">00:54:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">build out these other things as a way of supporting that thing? Right. And as it happens, a lot of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3300" target="_blank">00:55:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">mechanisms by which people discover stuff these days, especially books is in mediums, very different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3308" target="_blank">00:55:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">than books. So like people who listen to podcasts are the kind of people who download audio books,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3316" target="_blank">00:55:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you know? And so the decision to have a podcast might seem like it's different than books, but it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3323" target="_blank">00:55:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">actually how you are building your book audience. Right. And the decision to say, oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3327" target="_blank">00:55:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I only write books is actually a decision to say, I want to have a very small audience for my books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3332" target="_blank">00:55:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">What number do you care more about?

You know, what's weird. I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3345" target="_blank">00:55:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">know either of those numbers. Like I, I, uh, I know what right thing right now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3353" target="_blank">00:55:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">did in its first week because my publisher sent me those numbers and now we're three months out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3358" target="_blank">00:55:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I couldn't tell you even within 30 or 40% what that number is. And I don't know if I know what our,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3367" target="_blank">00:56:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I definitely don't know what our daily or total audience is for daily stoic. I just know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3376" target="_blank">00:56:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that I make this stuff and that the reach is pretty big. I, I, I try, I try not to think too</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3384" target="_blank">00:56:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">much about those.

So, so it's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3556" target="_blank">00:59:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I write a book that has a bunch of ideas in it. And then, uh, instead of waiting for somebody on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3562" target="_blank">00:59:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">YouTube to read that book and rip it off into a bunch of different videos, I make videos about all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3569" target="_blank">00:59:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">those ideas in the books instead of waiting for someone to take one idea from, you know, uh, something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3578" target="_blank">00:59:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I said and turn that into a, an Instagram reel. I want to make that. And then, yeah, I think a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3583" target="_blank">00:59:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">about how do I get efficiency. So like I had a talk in Brazil on Friday now as a big, you know, it's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3590" target="_blank">00:59:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a disruptive thing, right? Like I had to get on a plane. I had to take two red eyes. I flew to another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3596" target="_blank">00:59:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">country. I gave a large talk, but you know, that talk was filmed and then I had to do a Q and a after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3602" target="_blank">01:00:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and that Q and a was recorded. And so, you know, that talk will become 15 clips that, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3610" target="_blank">01:00:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that Q and a will become a Q and a podcast episode. So I, I try to think about, I try to think about how do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3618" target="_blank">01:00:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I use this stuff in all the different mediums. And I, I, um, I think Gary Vaynerchuk is kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3623" target="_blank">01:00:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the guy that's pioneered a lot of this, the idea of like, Hey, each one of these platforms has its</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3628" target="_blank">01:00:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">own kind of unique audience and its own kind of unique language. And your job is to figure out how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3634" target="_blank">01:00:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to participate. You don't have to, but do you want to see that audience to someone else? Do you want to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3640" target="_blank">01:00:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, miss out on that chance? Now I, I also happen to subscribe to a lot of the things you talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3646" target="_blank">01:00:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">about, which is like, how do you personally set up your life? So like, I don't spend a lot of time on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3652" target="_blank">01:00:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">social media. I see social media primarily as a push medium. And I, the reason I have a team,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3660" target="_blank">01:01:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">could I do a lot of it myself? Probably would it be more profitable? You know, if I was more involved,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3665" target="_blank">01:01:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">probably, but it would also quality of life, there'd be a quality of life reduction. Cause I think a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3672" target="_blank">01:01:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of these mediums are not super healthy for the individual, but it would also just take me away</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3678" target="_blank">01:01:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">from the things that only really I can do, which is write the books that I write.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3682" target="_blank">01:01:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Um, I love this way of thinking. Yeah. I mean, I've been thinking about it. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3688" target="_blank">01:01:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">also this theory out there that you need a certain level of ubiquity before you can get big growth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3693" target="_blank">01:01:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. Um, it's when people kind of know who you are, that then when you have the right idea,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3699" target="_blank">01:01:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that's right timed, you get explosions. If they don't know where you are, it's hard for,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3702" target="_blank">01:01:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it's that like, well, yeah, I know Ryan Hall and I have seen some of his stuff that then allows,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3707" target="_blank">01:01:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">would you do something that time's right for that growth to happen? This is what I think about like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3711" target="_blank">01:01:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">your pandemic years. Right. I mean, I see 2016 through 2019, this, you kind of start launching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3718" target="_blank">01:01:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a strategy daily stoic, you build up these audiences into the hundreds of thousands, kind of somewhat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3723" target="_blank">01:02:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">painstakingly. Right. Yeah. And then there's like a three year period and everything jumps to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3727" target="_blank">01:02:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">millions. Right. Um, you can't go from 50,000 to millions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3732" target="_blank">01:02:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but like you can go from 600. And in other words, like you were out there, right? Like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3736" target="_blank">01:02:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">once there's a bit of a ubiquity for your ideas, you've defined yourself in the mind of a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3741" target="_blank">01:02:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">people. Now it's much more easy when they see a Ryan holiday book. Like I know exactly who that is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3747" target="_blank">01:02:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And now the fact that the topic is what I'm interested in, I'm super excited to buy. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3751" target="_blank">01:02:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if Steven Spielberg does a movie on a topic I'm interested in, like I'm a hundred percent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3757" target="_blank">01:02:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">going to go see that where that same topic, if I don't know. So, I mean, there's an interesting curve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3761" target="_blank">01:02:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think there's a lesson there as well is that, you know, your, your, your audience grew</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3766" target="_blank">01:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then it exploded. Um, but you can't skip the, the growth, unless you're pure algorithmic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3772" target="_blank">01:02:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like sure on YouTube, you could do this. Like if you're in a purely algorithmic medium, it's possible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3775" target="_blank">01:02:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">but that's a really, um, low touch audience anyways, but like your email newsletters, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3780" target="_blank">01:03:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There are definitely things that just take off like a rocket ship. I think you see this in music,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3785" target="_blank">01:03:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">right. There's the kind of musician that, that writes a handful of huge singles that just sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3791" target="_blank">01:03:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of break out. This is like lightning in a bottle. This is a magical thing. And maybe you're that artist</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3796" target="_blank">01:03:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and maybe you're not. I happen to be more a fan. Like I'm a, I'm a heavy metal fan. I'm wearing an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3802" target="_blank">01:03:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Iron Maiden shirt. Iron Maiden is a band that's basically never been on the radio, but 50 years in 40</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3809" target="_blank">01:03:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">plus years in they're like bigger than they've ever been. It was this sort of very slow and steady</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3814" target="_blank">01:03:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">multi-generational thing. And they kind of just do like Iron Maiden makes Iron Maiden music.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3820" target="_blank">01:03:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I heard their manager once said, um, uh, someone said, you know, you're one of my heroes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3826" target="_blank">01:03:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in the music business.

He said, I'm in the iron</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3830" target="_blank">01:03:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">fucking Maiden business. And this idea of like Iron Maiden makes Iron Maiden music and they make it for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3836" target="_blank">01:03:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Iron Maiden fans. And you kind of know what you're going to get, but they've done it so long</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3841" target="_blank">01:04:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that you start to get into that idea of like compounding returns. So it's not exactly exponential,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3848" target="_blank">01:04:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">but it is like linear in a, in a very powerful way. Right. And, and, um, you just kind of do what you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3857" target="_blank">01:04:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">do and you do it for your people. And there are going to be moments that sort of punctuate it. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3862" target="_blank">01:04:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, the pandemic was a big growth thing, but it's not like, it's not like we quadrupled in size</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3867" target="_blank">01:04:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">overnight. It was like, oh, you know, the list grew by 25% this year instead of 10%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3873" target="_blank">01:04:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3874" target="_blank">01:04:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But we've kind of just daily Stoic has just been this very steady, consistent thing that gets bigger</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3880" target="_blank">01:04:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and bigger. I like, look, you and I both know people who have put up videos that have done tens,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3886" target="_blank">01:04:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">hundreds of millions of views. Probably the most that any of my things have ever done is a couple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3891" target="_blank">01:04:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">million views, which is a lot. If your stuff is currently doing nothing, but if you're Mr. Beast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3898" target="_blank">01:04:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that's disaster comparatively, nothing. So I, I kind of just make a lot of stuff. I make it in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3905" target="_blank">01:05:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of different mediums and I, I, I do what I am excited and interested in about. And it's built this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3911" target="_blank">01:05:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of, you know, this, this, uh, this idea of a flywheel and it, yeah, it can become quite large,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3920" target="_blank">01:05:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but where, again, where your stuff has been helpful for me is like, could it be bigger?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3925" target="_blank">01:05:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I probably, um, will it be bigger in the future? I would say yes, but I, I would like it to be bigger</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3933" target="_blank">01:05:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">sustainably and not at the expense of my deep kind of thinking and the, the pleasure of doing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3943" target="_blank">01:05:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">doing the thing. Like if, if, if you told me daily Stoic could, could quadruple in size,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3948" target="_blank">01:05:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but I wouldn't be able to write any more books or write them at the level. And, and with the time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWH8Aztd-zM&t=3954" target="_blank">01:05:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that I currently do it, I would not take that trade.
