Family fun, giveaways, and exciting Kings hockey awaits. Get your tickets now at lakings.com/promotions and create lasting memories with your little ones. Hi, it's Miles and I'm really old and I love race cars and family adventure podcasts.</p><p>Goodbye. This is Family Adventure Podcast, inspiring families to dream, travel, and accomplish epic adventures. And now your host, Eric Hemingway. Hello folks, welcome back to Family Adventure Podcast. And if this is the first time you've come here, then how's it going? Welcome to the group. We're glad you're here.</p><p>This is the place where we like to talk about family adventure travel, kind of specializing in nomadic travel. Travel families that just take off and go for a year or more and live nomadically all over the globe or all of the United States. RVs, boats, bikes, whatever, trains. We don't have a train family yet, but we're looking for one.</p><p>So if you know somebody who's taking a long train ride or trains across countries, we'd love to hear about it. So anyways, this week we are finishing our interview with Joshua Sheets. Got into a little bit kind of general ideas last week. And this week he really dives into a lot of specifics on your budget, how to get a hold of your budget, find out ways you can save money.</p><p>It boils down to three things. I loved how he said it. How much you make, how much you spend, and what you do with the difference. And financial planning 101 is spend less than you make. So there's really only three ways you can tweak it. Either you make more money, spend less, or invest better.</p><p>So we talk a lot about that this week. That's pretty cool stuff. And yeah, so we're excited. So we'll dive right in. And thanks everybody for listening and for leaving reviews on iTunes. Appreciate that. And for joining our email list, we've got some exciting stuff coming up. We're going to actually start launching a coaching program where we are going to come alongside families and help walk them through the process from start to finish on how to build a plan to get you out of the treadmill onto a traveling life.</p><p>And we're super stoked to announce that in a few weeks. But we just wanted to kind of let you know that's coming up. And we will dive into the interview. Enough of me rambling on, all right? I'm shutting up now. Okay, let's head into the interview. Could I add, I prepared a few thoughts that I'd like to share that would be specific to travel.</p><p>And feel free to cut this out or to add it in another show and split it out or something like that. But I think it would be helpful to some ideas that would be helpful around family adventure. Great. Could I share? Okay. Yeah, sure. Could because I want to, I don't want to, I want to leave people with some tactics and some exposure to some big picture ideas without getting into like specifics.</p><p>But I want to apply the science of financial planning to the science of goal achievement. So first on debt, I wanted to give some tactics that I think would be helpful. As far as tactics, here would be some specific suggestions. Number one, start by tracking your money. The number one thing that most people do not do is they do not track their money.</p><p>If you do not track your money, then you don't know where it's going. And if you don't know where it's going, you can't go back and say, is it going where I want it to go? I don't care how you track your money. I recommend to people that they start with a way that's very tangible.</p><p>So sometimes just by being, you know, tangible with it, maybe that means a three of a five card in your pocket and a pen. Maybe that means a note on your smartphone. Maybe that means a checkbook register. Maybe that means, you know, just something where you're actually physically writing it down a notebook every night.</p><p>You take your receipts out and you write it down. Make up a way that works for you. I try not to say do it this way because some ways work for some people. Some people like their smartphone and enter that in. I personally don't. I would rather carry a three of a five card and a pen and write it down.</p><p>But track your money in some manner. There are a lot of great electronic solutions for this. So there are a lot of apps that you can use. There are integrated comprehensive apps. Mint is the most famous of them. There's an app called Personal Capital. These are probably two of the prettiest, most popular popularized.</p><p>There are a number of other apps that are more specific, a little bit simpler. Maybe you can find an app that you like. But I think there's a lot of value in you have to track your money. You have to track your money so that you can create what we call a cash flow statement.</p><p>And the key of this, I've got an entire show on it. Eric, you can go and find it in the show notes if you want to link to it. But I've got an entire show on how to create a cash flow statement. But here's the key. Most people, when they're creating a cash flow statement, they're purely writing down their expenses.</p><p>I recommend, that's a good place to start. If you've never done that, that's good. But you want to go and you want to track all of your income from every source before taxes. And then you want to write down all of your expenses to every source. And you want to go and do it before taxes.</p><p>Instead, what many people do is they just take the net that they get maybe on their paycheck and they write that down and they budget off of that. The problem is though, that there's 7.65% if you're an employee coming out already for social security, for employment taxes. That would be social security taxes and Medicare taxes.</p><p>Number two is that there's some amount of income tax being withheld and deducted from your check. And so I've helped people find tens of thousands of dollars that they're spending that we can just save on taxes. I did a show recently with a guy, Justin, from a website called Root of Good, who retired at 33 and we went through on the interview an example of where he was able to pay, he had $150,000 income and he paid his three kids and he paid $150 total of income taxes.</p><p>And we worked out that it's possible that somebody could make $150,000 and spend $30,000 on taxes. If you're looking for a travel budget, I just found a $30,000 travel budget with good tax planning. So create a cash flow statement and write down all of the pre-tax income and then write down what your taxes are, work that out.</p><p>I've got a whole show on that. Number two, create an actual balance sheet. This is another thing that many people don't do. Write down everything that you own, exactly what it's worth, everything that you owe, exactly what it's worth. Then you can look at those things and you can start to say, "Am I happy with this?</p><p>Am I making progress?" So those are the two fundamental financial statements that you need to create for yourself. That's the first thing that as a financial planner, when you come in and you're working with someone, the first thing that you do is you create those statements. I don't make a big deal about budgeting in the sense of a forward-looking, "Here's what I'm going to spend on this month or not." For some people, that's really, really helpful.</p><p>For other people, it's really, really discouraging. So I would encourage people, if they feel like they're not in control with their money, I would encourage them to really figure out a system of budgeting that works for them. What's simplest is a legal pad and a pen. Make it simple.</p><p>For some people, they like to use a software solution. There may be something built in with the bank, but budgeting is forward-looking, tracking is backward-looking. Budgeting is what affects how much money you have at the end of the month. Backward-looking just simply tells you what you did. If you are in trouble, you've got to budget.</p><p>If you are generally pretty comfortable, it's probably not so necessary. So I'm a little flexible on that. I would encourage people to get very tactical with their finance. What happens is that it's so easy in today's world to lose touch with your money. You've got your credit card registered at Amazon, so you just click "Buy with one click" and there's a new $10 e-book.</p><p>You've got your credit card running all of your bills. You've got all of these certain... You've got all these different things. What I've found when I've been in financial trouble, and this is one thing that has helped me, and I've noticed it to help many people as I've worked with them, is that I believe both automating your finances and un-automating your finances is very valuable.</p><p>If you're a little out of control, you need to pay attention. A good way to do that is stop the automatic payments everywhere, stop the automatic contributions everywhere, take a checking account and a checkbook register. The checkbook register is still the most valuable cash flow planning tool I've ever been able to figure out.</p><p>Our grandparents got rich with a checkbook register. Almost nobody keeps one today. And I find it incredibly valuable for me to keep a checkbook register. Write your bills manually, record the checkbook register, keep it up to date. That allows you to be in touch with what's going on. If you're happy with where you're at, you're happy with what you're saving, with where you're going, how it's working, then you can take that and you can translate that and say, "Now I'm going to go ahead and automate things." So automating is also powerful, but it's only powerful if you're doing the right thing.</p><p>So you can automate your savings, automate your investments. Make sure that you're actually paying yourself first. Most of the people all have heard of the idea of paying yourself first, but the idea doesn't get it done. Just actually saying, "I know about that," doesn't mean that the very first thing you do is save some money toward whatever the financial goal is that you have.</p><p>You have to actually do it. So figure out a way to make sure that you actually do it. One of the ways, if you're going through, there are only three things that you can possibly adjust from a strategy of wealth building. To build wealth, and I define wealth whether in a small sense toward a specific goal, that may be a family adventure goal, or in the larger sense, that may be toward something like financial independence.</p><p>There are only three things that you have control over. The number one thing is how much income do you have? The number two is how much are your expenses? And number three is what do you do with the difference between those two? So people who are broke, they don't make very much money, they have high expenses, sometimes those expenses exceed their income, so they're paying a lot of interest on the difference between those things.</p><p>People who get wealthy have a much higher income than they do have expenses, and so they have a higher income, they have lower expenses, and they invest the difference between those things wisely. That's it. That's the formula. That's frustrating and it's encouraging. It's encouraging because it's simple, it's frustrating because you don't know exactly what to do with it.</p><p>So the key is to attack it in different periods of time. So number one, income. Is there something that I can or should do to increase my income? This can be as simple as changing jobs. Most people do not handle their career in an efficient manner. They're happy with getting a 3%, 4%, 5% raise, when you could find a competitor, if you enhanced your attractiveness to an employer, you may find a competitor who will give you a 55% raise.</p><p>And it's far easier to swap out employers every few years and climb the ladders of income, very straightforward, instead of staying at one place where they're just going to give you continual cost of living raises. But in order to do that, you have to become more attractive. So you have to focus on building your skills, you have to focus on becoming more employable, you have to focus on building up.</p><p>That may mean a formal certification, maybe you need an MBA, maybe you don't because a formal certification is not valuable, but you need to become much more excellent with leadership. You need to go to some industry conferences, you need to network within your industry, you may need to start a blog where you're doing book reviews on your industry.</p><p>So something if you're an employee to increase your income substantially. If you're an entrepreneur, you have a tremendous opportunity to focus on ways to constantly be increasing your income. Number two is expenses. I think there are a couple of ways that are useful to track expense, to do expenses.</p><p>Because you started with tracking expenses, then I would recommend that you order these expenses from highest to lowest and from lowest to highest. Many people when they first start to think about saving money, they automatically start with the little things. So there's a joke in the personal finance world about the latte factors.</p><p>The idea is if you just cut out the expensive coffee, you'll get rich. That may be and that works great. But the reality is that some people really love and value that daily latte. So it may be that it's more effective to flip it around and say, what are my biggest expenses?</p><p>So you see this a lot of times when people get a travel bug. List your expenses in order of highest expenses to lowest expenses. For most people, the number one highest expense will be housing. So start with housing and say, what could I do to cut my housing cost by 50% or more without sacrificing my lifestyle?</p><p>It may or may not be possible, but by asking a really big question like that, you may come up with an alternative idea that will fit your goal. So Eric, you and Rachel were sailors. There are tons of people who all throughout a period of time have done this.</p><p>They move from a house onto a sailboat. They don't have the money to go sailing yet, but they buy the sailboat and they move in there and they cut their expenses by a massive amount while they're still saving. That makes the goal be able to achieve much more quickly.</p><p>So what can I do to cut this by 50% or more? And then brainstorm that. Write that question at the top of a sheet of paper. Write down 30 ideas to activate the creative juices. The first 8 may be easy and the last 22 are incredibly difficult. But be creative, be wacky, be crazy.</p><p>I could move into my car, I could move in with my parents, I could rent out 3 of my rooms on Airbnb, I could have a roommate, we could move to Japan. I don't know what the answer is, but be wacky, be crazy. And then just simply look at those ideas and see, do I actually want to do any of these?</p><p>If you don't want to do any of them, skip it. Do the exercise in a different way and do something. But you can come up with solutions that work for your scenario if you ask that kind of question. Look at transportation expenses. There's a common thread in the early retirement community that what you do is you buy a house that's either close to your job or you rent an apartment that's close to your job.</p><p>Or it can be on a place that you have public transportation to your job. So maybe you ride on a bus line or a subway stop that goes directly to your job. So you can sell a couple of cars or sell one of the cars. Cars are expensive to own and operate, so maybe there's your travel fund.</p><p>That's usually for most people, it's housing, taxes, vehicle expenses are often the biggest categories, followed by food. So you can say, what can I do to cut my food costs by 50% or more? And you may be able to find an answer. So you would eat rice and beans, you would learn to coupon, you would grow your own food.</p><p>I don't know the answer, but it's a mental shift. Then flip it. And at some point in time, this is not all exercises for one night, this is an ongoing period of an action plan. Flip it on its head and start with little expenses and say, what can I do with this little expense?</p><p>I'm spending $60 a month on my cell phone bill. My wife and I have iPhone plans that cost $10 a month with Air Voice Wireless. So if I can save $50 a month on my cell phone bill, that's a major savings. So flip it and look through all those little expenses.</p><p>And I like to tell people, optimize one thing every month. So pick one category and spend a month on that category. Brainstorming, what are my ideas, what could I implement? Maybe you need to research cell phone carriers, maybe you need to shop your auto insurance. Some people can save $1,000 a year just by shopping their car insurance, but most of the time we don't do it.</p><p>So if we can do it, and then sitting down and working on it, and consistently working on it, we can reduce those expenses. And the key is, it's often easier to reduce expenses than it is to increase income or increase investment returns. Quick rule of thumb, and I know I'm just like spurting everything out, but I want to make this show incredibly valuable, because I want to see tons of people having family adventures.</p><p>But a quick rule of thumb from the early retirement community that I think is so valuable is to operate in terms of a mental model of financial independence. So there's a rule of thumb that we use in financial planning, that if you're going to live off of a portfolio of investment assets, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, then you can safely spend about 4% of a portfolio per year into perpetuity.</p><p>Now there's some more nuance to it, but it's a useful mental model. So what you can do is you can take every single monthly expense and you can multiply that monthly expense by 3% and that will tell you how much of a portfolio you need to have in order to fund yourself on an ongoing basis without needing to work.</p><p>So let's say somebody wants to go and travel and their monthly travel budget is $2,000. Well a good place to start with a financial goal is take $2,000 and multiply that times 300. That comes out to be $600,000. Now this is not the only way to go and travel, but if you wanted to travel full time, you wanted to "retire", then you need a $600,000 portfolio under that rule of thumb doing this with mutual funds and paper assets.</p><p>So a question would be if I'm looking at a cell phone bill and let's say that I'm looking at there and there's a mom and a dad and a couple of kids on a cell phone plan and that cell phone plan is $150 a month. In order to pay for that cell phone bill on an ongoing basis, I multiply that $150 times 300.</p><p>And I can look at that and say this person needs to save $45,000 to be able to fund this cell phone bill into perpetuity. Now if I could cut that from $150 a month to $50 a month, then $50 a month times 300 winds up being $15,000. So that's a difference of a total need to accumulate an extra $30,000.</p><p>The question is this, you look at your savings rate and you say, "Okay, I'm saving this amount of money on a monthly basis. How long will it take me to accumulate $30,000?" For many people that's 3, 4, 5, 6 years to be able to accumulate that. And a lot of times it's easier to go from $150 a month cell phone expense to a $50 a month cell phone expense than it is to go from, you know, to save, than it is to save the extra, go from $15,000 saved to $45,000 saved.</p><p>So that's a very useful rule of thumb that I use in my mind to evaluate ongoing expenses and say, "Is this worth it to me?" It values a lot. If you recognize that I could save $200 a month on my groceries by working out a couponing strategy or by growing some of my own food or by learning to cook for myself, that's $60,000 that I don't need to save toward that ongoing travel expense.</p><p>I'll pause because I just gave you a pop. No, that is fantastic. That is a great way to think about it. When you think about taking that number and multiplying it times 300 and really this is what you're going to look at over the long haul, that is a huge shift and that is radical personal finance.</p><p>That's really grabbing the checkbook by the horns and putting it into practical terms, which is fantastic. So many... The average person, what maybe 2 out of 100 think like that or actually dive into their own finances and really evaluate where they are and where they're going. Very few do.</p><p>Very few. What would it look like if more did? It's awesome. I've got a couple more ideas I want to share. I want to flip it, especially with the focus on travel, which went over is basically some money management. So that's focusing a lot on the income and the expense side.</p><p>When it comes down to how can I invest the difference wisely, then this will tie over to the income side. So one of the things that is a very useful mental model, some people will look at things from the perspective of how can I fund things off of an investment portfolio.</p><p>But if you want to live a family adventure of some kind, that doesn't necessarily have to be the only way to fund things. We need cash flow. So all financial planning is based around cash flow. If you and your wife needed $1,400 a month to live on your sailboat after you had purchased it with your family, then all you need to be able to do that is $1,400 a month.</p><p>That $1,400 a month, if you had $14,000 sitting in a bank and you're spending $1,400 a month, now we have 10 months worth of expenses. So we have 10 months worth of freedom. And that's going to be coming from many other sources. If you had Social Security income of $1,400 a month, that could provide it.</p><p>Most people, unless you're disabled, I had somebody I worked with actually who was disabled at an early age, and they had under $1,000 a month, they lived on a sailboat. And they traveled the Caribbean constantly, full-time, living on their sailboat, because that was how they could live a great life on their disability income.</p><p>So I encourage people, investing is a really important skill, and it's awesome if you can fund an investment, if you can fund an adventure based upon investments. Me, that's kind of the ultimate, because that's true financial independence, when you don't have to do any work, and your investment portfolio will build that for you.</p><p>But there are other ways to do it. So you could have somebody who works occasionally. So if you earn $2,800 a month, that means for every 6 months you work, and you can save $1,400, you can buy 6 more months of not having to work, as a very simple formula.</p><p>So sometimes occasional working. Many people would love to be able to build their income online, and many people have done it. So you can build some sort of business. So this could be a so-called location-independent business, - Yeah, that list might be longer. - It is far longer. But sometimes focusing on a more local brick-and-mortar business might be more efficient.</p><p>As far as a useful kind of construct, when you're looking at, and I just recorded a show about this, that hasn't been released yet, but just kind of talking about the different ways of doing things. There are fundamentally 3 different asset classes that I'm aware of that big picture can be used.</p><p>And number 1 is entrepreneurship or business ownership, number 2 is real estate, and number 3 is paper assets. So entrepreneurship or business ownership, if it's appropriate for somebody's personality, can often have the highest potential rate of return. So if somebody's saying, "OK, I'm able to save some money, what's going to be my best investment?" If it's appropriate for them, building a business or an entrepreneurial endeavor of some kind can often be the highest rate of return because you can multiply the money incredibly massive.</p><p>The right investment in the right marketing program for your business may result in a thousands of percent rate of return. So it's got opportunities for just massive growths if the business is successful. It's also got tremendous opportunities for tax advantages. One of my personal pet peeves and personal passions is actually tax planning because the more money you save on taxes is more money that you can spend.</p><p>So instead of the government stealing the money out of your pocket and spending it on all the stuff that it spends the money on, much of which in my opinion is a total waste, then you can spend it on what you want to spend it on. People often talk about tax breaks for the rich.</p><p>The trick is, however, there are two different almost segments of the tax code. This is not actual, this is more metaphorical. There's a personal tax code and there's a business tax code and all the good stuff is in the business tax code. So if you build out some kind of entrepreneurial endeavor, I like to use a simple example.</p><p>If you are one who is making a legitimate income writing and selling travel books, you can avoid the taxes on some portion of those tax expenses. It's a very involved process to do it carefully and to do it appropriately where you have good records and you're in good shape.</p><p>But that trip that I said where I took the two weeks and traveled, that was a 100% deductible expense for me because I was attending two business conferences that were 100% related to my business. So I was able to get a good record and I was able to get a good record and I was able to get a good record and I was able to get a good record and I was able to get a good record and I was able to get a good record and I was able to get a good record and I was able to get a good record and I was able to get a good record and I was able to get a good record and I was able to get a good record and I was able to get a good record and I was able to get a good record and I was able to get a good record and I was able to get a good record and I was able to get a good record and I was able to get a
