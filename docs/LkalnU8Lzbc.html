If you are going to continually focus what matters to you and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">your strategies for how to get there, you are going to have to consume self-help. Now this term</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is one that I think is broad, but we often narrow what we think it means. So when we think about it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we're imagining potentially cheesy books from the self-help shelf in the bookstore that's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">have a lot of lists of advice or a lot of emotional encouragement, like you can do it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">go get after it. It's a very narrow thing, something we're almost embarrassed about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I think though, what I'm going to try to argue here today is that the variety of information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">sources that count as self-help is much, much broader, and understanding this and understanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">how to intelligently navigate this landscape of self-help writ large is absolutely necessary if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to become wiser and therefore have a foundation on which to cultivate a truly deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">life. So here's what I'm going to do today. I'm going to break the broad category of self-help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">into three smaller categories, and I'm going to talk about each, and I'll give you a piece of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">advice for each about how to navigate that particular collection of self-help sources</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in the most effective way possible. Then too, at the end, I have a couple of thoughts about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">what you should do with all of this information. I'm talking logistically, administratively,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">what do you do with all the information that you encounter in your self-help journey so that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">can actually remember to make use of it going forward? All right, so that's my plan. For those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">who are watching, I'm going to bring up my tablet here. So if you're listening and you want to watch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this, this is episode 286. Just go to the deeplife.com/list and find episode 286. The video</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of the episode will be posted below. All right, so here's what's on my screen. For those who can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">see it, there is a header, three categories, because I am going to divide the world of things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we could potentially call self-help into three categories. And I am going to expertly draw,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because as Jesse knows, I'm a fantastic artist. When I draw on this tablet, it is not unlike</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Picasso drawing the peasant's hands. I'm going to draw a picture for each of these categories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Those who are watching can try to guess. All right, so for the first category,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">let's see, what am I going to draw here? Jesse's gotten pretty good at guessing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">roughly speaking, at least when I'm drawing. Maybe not what the category is. All right. Yay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so I'm realizing now, Jesse, what I drew kind of looks like a body in a coffin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not what I meant. I mean, category one, it would be funny if my first category was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you want real self-help? You need to hang out at the cemetery. Memento mori, you sons of bitches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You got to look at the corpses and say, that's going to be me. No, that's supposed to be a phone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">That's supposed to be a phone with someone dancing on it. All right. So what is this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">first category? I call it pre-digested self-help. So what I mean by pre-digested is that these are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">forms of self-help in which the advice has already been extracted and clarified for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's some ideas, but more importantly, here's what you should do. Like here's 10 things you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">should do. Here's a plan you can follow. Here's a particular procedure that you can put into place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So it has, someone has taken an information from the world that is relevant to improving yourself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and digested it for you already. And they have been given it to you in the form of advice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">There's three big categories, subcategories in here. And what I'm going to do is list them in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the order of increasing quality. And by quality, I mean potential for impact in your own life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So within pre-digested, the lowest quality subcategory would be short videos and social</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">media posts. It is a lot of this, a lot of Instagram, a lot of tech talk, a lot of YouTube</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that is, Hey, I'm going to help you figure out how to cut fat so you can get shredded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to help you figure out like how to study better for your exam.

But the reason why I'm putting that at the bottom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of the hierarchy here is that there are different objectives for the authors of this content.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's sort of mixed motivations. The number one thing, if you're creating this type of content</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is virality. So really the master that these content creators are serving is they want the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">relevant algorithm to like and bless what they're doing over time. This pushes the way the content</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">goes. It doesn't mean there's not useful information in this content, but the goal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of the content is not to be as useful to you as possible. It's to get recommended as many times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">as possible. Right? And so this, this is different.

These are better because when you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">creating a podcast, that's relevant to self-help.

There</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">is no algorithm that recommends podcast.

It's very organic. If you like this show enough,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll eventually tell someone about it.

It's been effective for you. So listening to podcasts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that are giving advice, this is a higher level of predigested self-help because the incentives are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">now aligned.

Why? Because over time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">people found it worked and they're like, okay, they told other people about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So advice books like podcast, advice podcast want to be useful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but the authors have more time to clarify, clean up, and polish what they're saying.

I would recommend at least once per year, if not twice,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=1382" target="_blank">00:23:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">build towards an expert source.

Because what matters is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=2349" target="_blank">00:39:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that you keep coming back to intention, not that everything in your plan actually gets executed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=2355" target="_blank">00:39:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So I think that's important. Let me give you a couple of tactical things here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=2360" target="_blank">00:39:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">about the specific brick wall activities.

But let's talk a little bit more about these really hard activities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=2372" target="_blank">00:39:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to give you two practical suggestions. One, softer entry. So if you have a really hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=2380" target="_blank">00:39:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">task that every time it comes up, it just paralyzes you. Like for me, this might be something like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=2385" target="_blank">00:39:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">here's a really tricky long form New Yorker piece that you've promised to write.

Instead of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=2399" target="_blank">00:39:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">scheduling on your calendar four hours to quote unquote, write a draft of this really hard article,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=2405" target="_blank">00:40:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you schedule one half hour to go for a walk somewhere scenic and just think about like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=2411" target="_blank">00:40:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">"How am I going to do this article?

It is just you thinking. And what happens if you don't really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=2425" target="_blank">00:40:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">come up with any good ideas? Nothing. You get a nice walk for a half hour. That's a softer entry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=2430" target="_blank">00:40:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So you get to one of these pre-deep tasks, you'll do it. "Yeah, I got to go for a walk. This is an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=2435" target="_blank">00:40:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">easy thing to do."

And now that you've had that preparatory period, when you next get to a bigger</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=2446" target="_blank">00:40:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">block scheduled to do the hard thing, it's going to be much easier to start because it's not a cold</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=2450" target="_blank">00:40:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">start.

The other thing to keep in mind is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=2462" target="_blank">00:41:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe you're procrastinating on these really hard tasks.

In that world of the Manhattan Project, which he was involved in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5412" target="_blank">01:30:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and the U.S. physics revolution as it picked up steam going into the '40s and '50s, in that whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5419" target="_blank">01:30:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">world, he was considered this huge brain. He was the guy who could walk in, solve the equation on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5424" target="_blank">01:30:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the chalkboard, walk out, and on his way out, build a computer. So anyways, if you don't know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5429" target="_blank">01:30:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Jean von Neumann, you should. Incredible polymath, brilliant guy. And this book was really good. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5438" target="_blank">01:30:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">really covers it well. What I liked about this book, it's a serious science writer. He gets the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5442" target="_blank">01:30:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">science and math right. So there's multiple fields that von Neumann was involved in that overlaps my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5448" target="_blank">01:30:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">own training as a professor. And I can say Bhattacharya got this right. So he goes deeper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5453" target="_blank">01:30:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">on the science and math than you sometimes get in these science biographies. So I really love</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5458" target="_blank">01:30:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">this book. I'm a big von Neumann fan. If you like Richard Feynman, for example, you should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5464" target="_blank">01:31:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">read von Neumann. If you're interested in Turing, you should read von Neumann. He was deeply involved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5468" target="_blank">01:31:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in both of their lives. Great book. "The Man from the Future." Going the other way, I read "The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5474" target="_blank">01:31:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Pelican Brief" by John Grisham. I realized, I don't know if I'd ever read that before. And it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5479" target="_blank">01:31:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">was fine. I don't know. I've been rereading some Grisham recently. It was fine. It's a reasonable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5486" target="_blank">01:31:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">serviceable thriller, I would say. Then I read "If You Could Live Anywhere" by Melody Warnick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5496" target="_blank">01:31:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I like the premise of the book. If we go back to the categories from the beginning of this episode,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5501" target="_blank">01:31:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this is classic self-help advice. And the book is about, in a world of remote work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5509" target="_blank">01:31:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you have a lot of options about where you could live. So how do you figure out where to live?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5513" target="_blank">01:31:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a good premise. It's very advice-y, very checklist advice-y. Think about this. Build a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5519" target="_blank">01:31:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">spreadsheet. So it's like a very pragmatic book. She wrote another book before this that I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5524" target="_blank">01:32:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">interested in reading, which was, "How Do You Learn to Love Where You Are Living?" So she wrote</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5529" target="_blank">01:32:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that pre-pandemic. I might go back and check that book out because I think it has more of her</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5534" target="_blank">01:32:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">personal story, which sounds interesting to me. They moved to a small town. I think it's in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5538" target="_blank">01:32:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Virginia. Maybe it was in North Carolina. Maybe it was in Tennessee. Actually, I clearly have no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5542" target="_blank">01:32:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">idea where this town was. But she moved into some small town. And the book is about how she learned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5548" target="_blank">01:32:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to love this town. So how do you love the place you are? You get involved and learn to love it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5553" target="_blank">01:32:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">as opposed to always looking and thinking about what place could be better. So that book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5558" target="_blank">01:32:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which preceded this one, sounds interesting too. I just haven't read it yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5561" target="_blank">01:32:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Then I read "Man's Quest for God" by Abraham Joshua Heschel. It's a book about prayer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5571" target="_blank">01:32:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">A book about prayer coming at it from the Jewish perspective. The thing about Heschel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5579" target="_blank">01:32:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if the audience knows much about Heschel. A German-Jewish theologian and scholar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5587" target="_blank">01:33:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">brought over, essentially rescued from Germany at the last possible minute before the door slammed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5594" target="_blank">01:33:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">shut for Jews in Germany under the reign of Hitler. Comes to the U.S., doesn't speak any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5600" target="_blank">01:33:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">English, becomes a great theologian and scholar in the U.S. His style, the thing about Heschel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5608" target="_blank">01:33:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and he's one of the best-known Jewish thinkers of the 20th century, marched with Martin Luther</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5613" target="_blank">01:33:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">King, really interesting figure. The thing about his style is he has two things he's mixing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5622" target="_blank">01:33:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a scholarly aspect to him because he's a scholar, right? Like systematically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5627" target="_blank">01:33:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">let's break this down and think about it and here's the framework and what have other people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5632" target="_blank">01:33:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">said about this and let's cite things. He's also very poetic. So he's a poetic writer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5638" target="_blank">01:33:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when he's writing about religion, he will mix sometimes a very scholarly style,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5644" target="_blank">01:34:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">but also he'll also be poetic. Like I want the poetic nature of my words to convey information,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5650" target="_blank">01:34:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">also my scholarly structures and information. "Man's Quest for God" really mixes these two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5656" target="_blank">01:34:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">together. It's kind of interesting. So there'll be these like long poetic statements, as well as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5660" target="_blank">01:34:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like very systematic conversations. This book's from the 1950s about the emerging role of symbolism</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5666" target="_blank">01:34:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and modernism and reconceptualizing religious thought. And it's like, it's all mixed together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5673" target="_blank">01:34:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not quick reading, but I thought it was really interesting. It's a really interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5678" target="_blank">01:34:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">take on prayer, especially the Jewish approach to prayer, which is halakic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5684" target="_blank">01:34:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">meaning it's very structured, ritualized. Islamic prayer is very similar to this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5690" target="_blank">01:34:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">as opposed to more of a ad hoc petitionary prayer, personalized prayer style. It's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5697" target="_blank">01:34:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">when I feel moved, I try to connect to the divine. The Jewish, and I think Islamic style,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5703" target="_blank">01:35:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it's much more structured. And they think that actually you're going to, in the end, get more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5708" target="_blank">01:35:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">intimations of the divine and insight by building structure around the activity. And he gets into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5713" target="_blank">01:35:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">all that. So if you're interested in that type of theology, it's a good book, but it's hard going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5719" target="_blank">01:35:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">because again, it's semi-academic, semi-academic, semi-poetic, semi-accessible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5723" target="_blank">01:35:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">>> So that was probably one of your expert primary source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5726" target="_blank">01:35:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">>> That's an expert primary source. Yeah. Yeah. I just been finishing up another Heschel book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5732" target="_blank">01:35:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that I think is more accessible. So we'll talk about that next month, but I would call it an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5737" target="_blank">01:35:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">accessible primary source. This kind of accessible, I've read other Heschel, I've read other theology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5742" target="_blank">01:35:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, maybe it's expert. Finally, I read Palestine 1936 by Oren Kessler. Part of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5751" target="_blank">01:35:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">ongoing efforts to self-educate about that part of the world. So Palestine 1936 is about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5758" target="_blank">01:35:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the big uprising. I think it was called the great uprising that occurred under British imperial role</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5766" target="_blank">01:36:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of mandate Palestine in the 1930s, 1936. That's why it's in there. The argument of the author</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5772" target="_blank">01:36:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">here is that that's really the birth of Palestinian nationalism. Like you can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5777" target="_blank">01:36:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">understand Palestinian nationalism without understanding what was happening under British</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5780" target="_blank">01:36:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">rule. And this first revolt that occurred in the thirties, that this really galvanized a lot of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5790" target="_blank">01:36:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">structures and thinking and fault lines on which the whole rest of the 20th century</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5797" target="_blank">01:36:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">conflict in there played out along. So you have to go back. You can't start with 1948.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5801" target="_blank">01:36:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You got to go back to the 1930s to really understand what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5806" target="_blank">01:36:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, Jesse, I felt for this author personally, because he tells the story early in the book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5815" target="_blank">01:36:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that he comes across this topic. He's like, no one's written about this. So I'm going to take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5822" target="_blank">01:37:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">on this book project because he can read the Arabic. He could read the Hebrew. There's not a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5826" target="_blank">01:37:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">lot in English. So it's a hard project, three-year project. I'm going to take this on. He gets going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5830" target="_blank">01:37:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">in the book. He's deep into the research process. Two books on the topic are announced after years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5837" target="_blank">01:37:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">There's some book in Hebrew and that's it. He's like, all right, I'm going to cover this. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5841" target="_blank">01:37:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be great. He gets into the project. Two books are announced after he starts. But they were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5847" target="_blank">01:37:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">both very scholarly books. So I don't think they really stepped on his toes, but that's like classic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5851" target="_blank">01:37:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">writer's kismet. But anyways, it's a difficult research challenge that I think he did a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5863" target="_blank">01:37:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">good job on because the sources here, you have to contextually understand early 20th century</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5869" target="_blank">01:37:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Arabic sources.

And he pulls it together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5879" target="_blank">01:37:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think does a pretty good job of talking about this period. And it's also just an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5886" target="_blank">01:38:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting period. I mean, everything going on now is all about Britain's promises and changing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5891" target="_blank">01:38:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">promises for that area. And so Britain comes in. We don't have to go into the whole history of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5899" target="_blank">01:38:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">middle East, but when Britain takes that over after they beat the Ottoman empire in world war one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5904" target="_blank">01:38:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">they have this declaration where they say, okay, we're going to take this over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5907" target="_blank">01:38:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll call this mandate Palestine. And part of the goal here is we're going to establish a Jewish</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5912" target="_blank">01:38:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">state. And then they kind of come back from that. Like, actually, maybe, maybe we don't want to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5918" target="_blank">01:38:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that. And then they changed their mind again. Like, no, no, we do want to do that. And it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5921" target="_blank">01:38:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">was in response to that second. No, we definitely do want to do this. That caused the great uprising,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5926" target="_blank">01:38:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the, the, the 1936 uprising. So there's like this negotiation back and forth. Britain was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5932" target="_blank">01:38:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">basically using that region as a pawn. I mean, a lot of their interest had to do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5936" target="_blank">01:38:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like, why did they, as they got closer to 1936, why were they saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5939" target="_blank">01:38:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">why were they going back and forth on this as they were trying to set things up for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5943" target="_blank">01:39:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">impending world war two and where they're going to need Arab support. It's like a very complicated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5948" target="_blank">01:39:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">political picture. And I think the book does a good job of capturing what's going on there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5955" target="_blank">01:39:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that's useful. I mean, obviously there's other, there's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5958" target="_blank">01:39:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to put a lot of emphasis on whatever you write about. So Kessler puts a lot of emphasis</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5963" target="_blank">01:39:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">on 1936. And this did seem like an important period, but obviously there's other really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5968" target="_blank">01:39:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">important things that happened subsequently that you need to understand Palestinian nationalism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5973" target="_blank">01:39:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, like you really do need to understand Algeria and the, that decolonial movement in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5981" target="_blank">01:39:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Algeria and how that influenced Yasser Arafat. And there's a lot of other things, especially in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5987" target="_blank">01:39:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the sixties, I think that happened that were just as important for understanding like modern</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5993" target="_blank">01:39:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Palestinian nationalism. It's, you know, so it's not the full picture, but when you write these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=5997" target="_blank">01:39:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">books, you, you, you know, it's always my thing I'm writing about was the key, but I could follow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=6001" target="_blank">01:40:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it. I could follow it. So I thought it was a good, good history book. Well researched.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=6008" target="_blank">01:40:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, complicated. You got to speak a lot of languages to write about. If I ever became a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=6011" target="_blank">01:40:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">historian, this is what I've learned. You want to focus on a topic that is in your language and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=6017" target="_blank">01:40:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">from like close to your time period. So you just understand that you understand the language,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=6021" target="_blank">01:40:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">understand the context already makes things easier. All right. Anyways, that's probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkalnU8Lzbc&t=6026" target="_blank">01:40:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">enough time for today.
