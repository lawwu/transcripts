I said I was worried about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">markets. Discount rates had to go up. There was more uncertainty in the world. But when I start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking about what's going on, what this administration is trying to accomplish, all at very large scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So think about this. Whatever you think about each one of these individual things, they're trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">totally transform global trade. So that's trade negotiations with 100 countries. We effectively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.740</a></span> | <span class="t">have an embargo between us and China today. 140% tariff, export controls. And so we have to renegotiate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that deal. Besant said today it really hasn't even started. That's going to be a slog. On top of that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we have taxes. If we don't lock in the tax bill, it doubles at the end of the year. We have this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.540</a></span> | <span class="t">reconciliation package.

We have questions around the 10-year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and whether or not deficit is going to actually be larger this year. We have the war in Ukraine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">right, and lots of back and forth there. We have dealing with the volatile situation in the Middle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">East. I mean, it sounds like we were on the verge maybe of seeing an Israeli attack on Iran. And all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of these things are happening simultaneously. And so one of the things that's just on my mind,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">if you look at the discounted rate of dealing with any of them successfully, and then you multiply those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.100</a></span> | <span class="t">discounted rates together, right, the probability that you're going to land this plane and just a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.700</a></span> | <span class="t">smooth landing, I think is challenging to see, right? We're going to have some wins. We're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.460</a></span> | <span class="t">to have some losses. And so today, I know we want to revisit some of these conversations around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">tariffs and free trade and these export controls and kind of where we are in the market. But I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">just say, we're attempting something very high difficulty level. And if this administration is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">able to land the plane on all these, it will be quite an accomplishment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And you bring up complex systems. This is the reason I spend so much time down at the Santa</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Fe Institute because that's all we talk about. But a couple of features of those things that relate to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">exactly what you said. First, it's very hard to know which variables are dependent in a complex</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">multi-variable system. And there may be one you don't know about that it flips and the whole system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">takes on a different shape. And this makes these things very hard to predict, which is why I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.820</a></span> | <span class="t">like talking about macro for that exact very reason, that there's so many variables, it's very hard to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">accurate and correct. And even if you are, it might just be by happenstance because you might not know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">the exact variable that caused it. So it is, it's difficult. And unfortunately, and I'll state again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't like talking about macro, but we're kind of forced into it because the market and even the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.540</a></span> | <span class="t">destiny of many of the high-tech companies that we would prefer to focus on seem to be caught up in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">this whole thing. For sure. For sure. I mean, I just saw a random tweet before we came in here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, somebody estimating that the revenue hit to Meta this year from reduced advertising by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the merchants, Chinese merchants on Meta like Timu is like $7 billion. Wow. Now think about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That's pure profit, right?

And so again, just the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.260</a></span> | <span class="t">downstream consequences of small changes. It's a little less because they'll backfill with something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.540</a></span> | <span class="t">else that may not pay as much credit.

It's pretty exhausting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but we got to lock in, you know, there's a super busy calendar ahead.

You know, so an export control</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1364" target="_blank">00:22:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">is effectively a license requirement that acts almost as an embargo on all trade in a particular good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1371" target="_blank">00:22:51.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So on April 5th, China implemented this rare earth ban. And then we reciprocated last week with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1377" target="_blank">00:22:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">the ban on all Nvidia H20 chips, uh, going to China. So when you, when you look at the rare earth ban,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1384" target="_blank">00:23:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and I have a list here of the materials that were banned on April 5th, and you have things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.860</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, that go in critical elements into magnets, samarium, terbium.

Okay. So you do have other places on the planet that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1405" target="_blank">00:23:25.140</a></span> | <span class="t">are, that are, uh, mining these rare earths. The problem is 90% of them are refined in China. When</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">they banned those rare earths, um, these are the magnets that go into EVs, phones, computers, machines,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.820</a></span> | <span class="t">of all sorts. This was called by some in and around the white house as a kill shot, a kill shot against</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.180</a></span> | <span class="t">the U S economy, um, that causes massive problems in industrial production. You know, when I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1434" target="_blank">00:23:54.580</a></span> | <span class="t">about, um, again, the destabilization that comes from over dependency on something like if every magnet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1443" target="_blank">00:24:03.300</a></span> | <span class="t">that goes into every machine in the United States is coming from, from China, and now we've effectively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1448" target="_blank">00:24:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">banned it, even though the ban was in response to the tariffs by the United States, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1454" target="_blank">00:24:14.020</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the off ramp to this? You know, I now see just this afternoon while we started recording the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">pod, Trump has said that, you know, he doesn't expect, uh, the, the tariffs to stay anywhere close</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">to where they are in China. He doesn't think they're going to be zero, but they won't be anywhere close</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1469" target="_blank">00:24:29.540</a></span> | <span class="t">to where they are. You know, he's, and we see kind of a unilateral walking down of these tariffs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1476" target="_blank">00:24:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">but these export bans are really dangerous, Bill. So what are your thoughts about an export ban,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1481" target="_blank">00:24:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">perhaps just compared to, uh, the tariff itself? Well, I mean, I go back to the Reagan video,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">right? He says this will eventually lead to retaliation and escalation. And, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1492" target="_blank">00:24:52.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the fact that this video was recorded, whatever eighties, what is that? Uh, 45 years ago, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1500" target="_blank">00:25:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">like, like this isn't a new perspective. So you could argue, oh my God, I can't believe this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1506" target="_blank">00:25:06.020</a></span> | <span class="t">happened. Or you could say, well, if you studied history, you should have expected this to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1510" target="_blank">00:25:10.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. In fact, there's this Milton Friedman video going around and he talks about retaliatory tariffs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And he says, okay, let's say that somebody shoots a hole in the bottom of your boat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1519" target="_blank">00:25:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. And so, you know, it's taking on water. A retaliatory tariff would be like you shooting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.020</a></span> | <span class="t">another hole in the bottom of the boat. And then they shoot a hole in the bottom boat just sinks faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1530" target="_blank">00:25:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Right. And he's saying, uh, you know, but in fact, what we did last week is the U.S. did ban</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1537" target="_blank">00:25:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">H20s going to China. And this was a pretty controversial move. And in fact, I was, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1543" target="_blank">00:25:43.380</a></span> | <span class="t">looking at some of the analysis that was done this week and the newly launched Huawei cluster matrix</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1549" target="_blank">00:25:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">384 is China's competitor to the GB 200. So semi-analysis is out with, you know, an assessment of this and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">many others. And basically what they concluded is that Huawei is already on the frontier or near the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1565" target="_blank">00:26:05.140</a></span> | <span class="t">frontier with respect to chips. In fact, one of the analysts on CNBC this week said, to be honest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1570" target="_blank">00:26:10.820</a></span> | <span class="t">we basically just handed the China AR market to Huawei anyway. Right. And as Bernstein analysts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1578" target="_blank">00:26:18.020</a></span> | <span class="t">because they said what it effectively does is clears the decks for Huawei to have monopoly profits in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1584" target="_blank">00:26:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">China.

It was a chip that was two or three generations behind what we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1596" target="_blank">00:26:36.900</a></span> | <span class="t">have in this country. But it was, you know, some people think of retaliation to the rare earths.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1602" target="_blank">00:26:42.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Other people think it's just part of, you know, the AI strategy to try to win the AI war against China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1609" target="_blank">00:26:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, and let's just take the argument that it was a retaliatory move. How good must it feel to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1616" target="_blank">00:26:56.500</a></span> | <span class="t">NVIDIA and Jensen and the executive team there that you become a pawn in these games that you had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1622" target="_blank">00:27:02.260</a></span> | <span class="t">nothing to do with creating, you know? And in fact, you designed this product specifically to meet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1629" target="_blank">00:27:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">the expert control rule that was in place before this one, which is very similar to this Vietnam thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1636" target="_blank">00:27:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">that we were just talking about.

I reposted when this all happened,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1641" target="_blank">00:27:21.940</a></span> | <span class="t">a great video that Deirdre did over at CNBC, um, about how this will be good for Huawei.

And,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1669" target="_blank">00:27:49.300</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, there, I read one article that said that China's, you know, getting some of their very first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1676" target="_blank">00:27:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">commercial planes off the ground.

I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1692" target="_blank">00:28:12.340</a></span> | <span class="t">the fact of the matter is if they had no capability to develop it, it would be one thing, right? I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1697" target="_blank">00:28:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">more like the, the, the race around nuclear arsenals, if you will.

I think that there's a legitimate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1719" target="_blank">00:28:39.140</a></span> | <span class="t">national interest in, you know, quote unquote, staying out in front on AI. I think there's a debate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1725" target="_blank">00:28:45.460</a></span> | <span class="t">to be had about that. That's where I come down on that side of the issue. But the H20s, it seemed to me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPfE5SS7fc0&t=1731" target="_blank">00:28:51.540</a></span> | <span class="t">was a very self-defeating way.
