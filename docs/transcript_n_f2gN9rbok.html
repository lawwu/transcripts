It's that we want to get good quantity of sleep, good quality of sleep, and good consistency of sleep. All three of those factors independently are related to our metabolic health. Some people may not be feeling their best or doing great with their metabolic health, and they're like, "But I get seven or eight hours of sleep a night," so we need to dial in some of the other factors too.</p><p>So when I talk about sleep quantity, the sweet spot for metabolic health seems to be about seven to eight hours of good quality sleep per night. It's variable for different people. This is why wearables like Oura rings are great. For quality, this is about uninterrupted sleep. So we know that people who have more interruptions in their sleep have a much higher risk for metabolic disease.</p><p>So this is like anything that's a distraction or interruption in the room or light in the room can impair quality of sleep, and that impacts metabolic health. If there's interruptions, that happens, but we can do the best we can. And then for consistency, we're talking about basically going to bed at a regular time and getting up at a regular time.</p></div></div></body></html>
