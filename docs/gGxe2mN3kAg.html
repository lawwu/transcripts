target="_blank">00:02:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's called Fastbook, it's a fastbook repo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Honestly, I make basically nothing from the book, so I don't feel like you need to buy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it to say thank you or something, buy it if you want the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're happy using notebooks, use the free one, it's all good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the book was actually written as Jupyter notebooks, and we wrote something to turn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it into a book book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now the book will also, by the way, actually looks great on Kindle, online, as well as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">paper.</span></div><div

does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the course goes through half of the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so quite soon we'll do a part two, which will go through the other half of the book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">plus some other new stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically each lesson covers a chapter or so of the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're doing this course, you'll be going through the book, at least in the notebooks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and you might want the paper one as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So here is the main thing that you should commit to right now, which is to finish the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=210"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Because everybody I think who joins comes in thinking, okay, I'm going to do this, I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">going to do deep learning, but if

target="_blank">00:04:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">If that's your intention up front, no problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But if your intention is to be a really effective deep learning practitioner, you

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And she did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And that project has ended up creating music which the BBC Orchestra played,

from me or some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of them are from me via

target="_blank">00:05:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is one example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So finish the course and finish a project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So finishing the course means being tenacious.</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="t">And in fact, this is a quote from our book, the number one thing I see the difference</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">between successful deep learning practitioners and not is tenacity, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And tenacity is on the whole something you can choose.</span></div><div

yourself in the middle of a global</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.000</a></span> | <span

right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And saying, okay, something's happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't do what I hope to do

target="_blank">00:08:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe that's, you know, quite often I'll have a bump that's like a year long, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But if I've decided to finish something, you know, at the end of that year, I'll go back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and finish it.</span></div><div

from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this book called

a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">job that he found boring, and he set out to learn deep learning and repeatedly failed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.000</a></span> | <span

extremely tenacious, and each time he failed to do so, he tried again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And eventually he figured out a way to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way he did it was very intensely based on fast AI, both the course and the philosophy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he's kind of a good example, like I always think it's a good idea to have a role</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">model.</span></div><div

like both a role model for like trying, failing, trying, failing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">trying, failing, and then, you know, finding some success.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

again and again from unsuccessful deep learning students is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=641"

okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1242" target="_blank">00:20:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's the lessons, which

places you can run the notebooks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1254" target="_blank">00:20:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's two types of platform for running the notebooks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1261" target="_blank">00:21:01.840</a></span>

away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So that is obviously the

that we have this clean version is to help you with these stages here, is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1845" target="_blank">00:30:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">our suggestion is once you've gone through the lesson, and you've run the notebook, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1852" target="_blank">00:30:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you feel like, okay, I think I get it, is you open up this clean version.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And before you run each cell, try to think, okay, why is this cell here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.800</a></span> | <span

going to do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1867" target="_blank">00:31:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">What's the output going to look like, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So once you remove all that context, this is a good test for you to kind of get your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1875" target="_blank">00:31:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">brain going to think what was actually going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1878" target="_blank">00:31:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a kind of much more active approach to reading and recall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1883" target="_blank">00:31:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so then once you've done that, and you've finished going through this, at the bottom,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1892" target="_blank">00:31:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">one thing that is kept is the questionnaire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1895" target="_blank">00:31:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So at the end of every chapter is a questionnaire.</span></div><div class="c"><span

looking, go through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1904" target="_blank">00:31:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and try to answer each of those questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1908" target="_blank">00:31:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They all have answers in the notebook, in the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1912" target="_blank">00:31:52.520</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:31:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you can't remember, that's a sign to you that like, oh, did I skip over that bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1921" target="_blank">00:32:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">too quickly?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1922" target="_blank">00:32:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Like what's happened that I've not remembered?</span></div><div class="c"><span

questionnaire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1932" target="_blank">00:32:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a lot of pieces to help take this from a passive, I'm just watching a video,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1939" target="_blank">00:32:19.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just reading a book, into a participatory exercise that you're a part of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

to do that, is basically at the end of lesson one, once</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=1966" target="_blank">00:32:46.880</a></span>

So as you're blogging, you'll be learning about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2510" target="_blank">00:41:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of the tools you need to learn about anyway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2524" target="_blank">00:42:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So one interesting idea for things to blog about is this example from Aman Arora, who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2531" target="_blank">00:42:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is an Aussie Fast AI alum who is now working at Weights and Biases, which is one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2536" target="_blank">00:42:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">top AI startups in the world. This is a really interesting kind of blog post. What Aman did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2545" target="_blank">00:42:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">was he took a video that I did at the launch here of the Queensland AI Hub, and he wrote</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2552" target="_blank">00:42:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">down what I said. And that's an example of something that you could do. If there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2560" target="_blank">00:42:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">videos out there that you liked and nobody's turned it into a post, be the first to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2567" target="_blank">00:42:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">so because there's all these benefits. When somebody sends me something saying, "I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2575" target="_blank">00:42:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">written up this talk you gave," I'm very grateful to that person because now my talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2580" target="_blank">00:43:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is now available in a second medium. A lot of people prefer to read rather than listen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2584" target="_blank">00:43:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to a talk.

They've taken the time to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2590" target="_blank">00:43:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">have me check their work. And kind of everybody ends up winning from this. So I've seen with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2597" target="_blank">00:43:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Aman's post about my talk, it's got attention from people that my talk didn't. So for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2606" target="_blank">00:43:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I noticed on my LinkedIn feed, the CEO of Data61, which is the CSIRO, so the top data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2614" target="_blank">00:43:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">science body in Australia, highlighted it and said, "Check out this post from Anamurara."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2621" target="_blank">00:43:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is like an example of the kind of stuff you can do. It's like try to be helpful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2628" target="_blank">00:43:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and at the same time you're also learning.

Ezra Dex says in this chapter of his book, "The key</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2660" target="_blank">00:44:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">about machine learning is that we can generalize.

And everything just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2676" target="_blank">00:44:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">about that we're doing in this course is all about creating models that are going to generalize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2683" target="_blank">00:44:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">well.

It's a really important idea is you need a good way to measure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2736" target="_blank">00:45:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">whether your model is any good. So you need a data set that really represents what kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2742" target="_blank">00:45:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of data is your model likely to have to deal with in real life. And my partner Rachel wrote</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2751" target="_blank">00:45:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">this really great blog post on the Fast.ai blog about this. Actually interestingly, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2756" target="_blank">00:45:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">was kind of came out of a lesson that I did at the University of San Francisco and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2763" target="_blank">00:46:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Rachel turned it into a blog post and Rachel's blog post has ended up much more influential</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2768" target="_blank">00:46:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">than my video ever was.

The next key thing that Radek mentions and I totally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=2785" target="_blank">00:46:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">agree with is it's hard to write correct machine learning code.

So the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3465" target="_blank">00:57:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">thing you need to do is you need to sign up to AWS.

So you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3479" target="_blank">00:57:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to ask them to give you permission to use their GPUs. Now that's called requesting a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3485" target="_blank">00:58:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">service limit increase.

So on Windows, in the store, there's something called the Windows Terminal, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3635" target="_blank">01:00:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Microsoft provides for free, which is pretty good. Mac has a terminal that comes with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3641" target="_blank">01:00:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Linux has a terminal that comes with it. So I'm using Windows, but it'll basically look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3648" target="_blank">01:00:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the same for everybody. Now on Windows, you need a Ubuntu Linux shell, not a normal Windows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3659" target="_blank">01:00:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">shell. So to do that, you need something called WSL, Windows Subsystem for Linux. And that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3666" target="_blank">01:01:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">will give you a full Ubuntu system on your Windows computer. Again, it's free. It only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3671" target="_blank">01:01:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">takes a couple of minutes to set up. So there's a link to how to do it here. So once you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3675" target="_blank">01:01:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">done it, whatever, whether you're on Mac or Linux or Windows, it's going to look basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3682" target="_blank">01:01:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the same, right? And so you'll create your SSH key by following the instructions in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3690" target="_blank">01:01:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">documentation, which is basically you run SSH keygen, and it's just going to go through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3695" target="_blank">01:01:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and create these two files. So you just run it, it creates these two files. And so this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3705" target="_blank">01:01:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is the one that we have to give Amazon. This is the one that we're going to keep for ourselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3710" target="_blank">01:01:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So following along in the documentation here, it says to click on services, EC2, find key</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3725" target="_blank">01:02:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">pairs. Okay, and then we'll go here, import key pair, and whatever, AWS. And this is where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3743" target="_blank">01:02:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to find the ID RSA pub that we just created. And you can see this, here it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3757" target="_blank">01:02:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is, right? It's just a big long code. And it's fine, you can all look at this. This is public,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3762" target="_blank">01:02:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">not secret. This is the call thing, right? There's no passwords. And I say import. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3767" target="_blank">01:02:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">so now we have an SSH key, and we can use that to log in. Okay, so this is just all this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3776" target="_blank">01:02:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is. Here's all those steps. So renting a server in AWS speak is called launching an instance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3787" target="_blank">01:03:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So to launch an instance, we'll scroll back up to the top to instances, and we will say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3794" target="_blank">01:03:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">launch instance. Okay. And it'll say, okay, what kind of thing do you want to run Amazon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3802" target="_blank">01:03:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Linux or Windows or Red Hat or whatever? I strongly, strongly suggest you use Ubuntu</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3807" target="_blank">01:03:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and the latest version, which is currently 20. So I'm just going to say select. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3813" target="_blank">01:03:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it'll say, okay, what kind of server do you want? For playing around, there's actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3819" target="_blank">01:03:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">one that you can get for free. Now it doesn't do, it's pretty, it's kind of slow, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3824" target="_blank">01:03:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But for learning about SSH and Linux and stuff, this is actually a great one to use. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3830" target="_blank">01:03:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">no good for deep learning. It doesn't have a GPU. So if I go to G4DN, that's the cheapest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3837" target="_blank">01:03:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of good GPUs we can get. And I'll get the smallest one there. G4DN xlarge. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3845" target="_blank">01:04:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll say next. Next. So how big a hard drive do I want? I normally say about 100 gig. Launch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3858" target="_blank">01:04:18.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And launch. And so now it's going to say, okay, when you log into this, which key pair</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3865" target="_blank">01:04:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">are you going to use? Okay. So you just select the one that you just imported and say, yep,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3871" target="_blank">01:04:31.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I know that I have that. And then launch. And you'll see, Dell says, this has now been initiated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3882" target="_blank">01:04:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's got a code. So this is the thing that I've just launched. So if I click on it, here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3887" target="_blank">01:04:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it shows me, here's my instance. Okay. So as you, if you haven't done much with servers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3901" target="_blank">01:05:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and Linux and SSH and stuff, there's going to be this whole world of new stuff for you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3906" target="_blank">01:05:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to learn about. But this is an opportunity. It's not a problem. So if you're not familiar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3910" target="_blank">01:05:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">with things like IP addresses, that's cool. There's lots of tutorials around at the moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3914" target="_blank">01:05:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But for now, just know this is the unique address, like a street address that your new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3920" target="_blank">01:05:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">computer has. And so we're going to connect to it. So this button here will click, will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3925" target="_blank">01:05:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">copy that address. Okay. So we can then go to our terminal and we can type SSH and paste</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3933" target="_blank">01:05:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in the address. And then the only other thing I do need to do is I need to say, provide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3939" target="_blank">01:05:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">a username and AWS always uses the username Ubuntu for all of its Ubuntu images. So you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3950" target="_blank">01:05:50.440</a></span> | <span class="t">say Ubuntu at, and then the IP. And so if I'm now press enter, we're in. Okay. So now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3959" target="_blank">01:05:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">everything I type here is actually being typed on that remote computer. So for example, to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3965" target="_blank">01:06:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">list the contents of a directory, I type LS. Okay. So the thing I'm actually typing into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3971" target="_blank">01:06:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">here is bash, a bash shell. So bash is something, another of these things need to be familiar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3975" target="_blank">01:06:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">with and you can learn about it in that missing semester MIT course I mentioned. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3981" target="_blank">01:06:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it takes a few weeks to get somewhat comfortable with bash. It's a very different feel to using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3989" target="_blank">01:06:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a GUI if you're more familiar with explorer or finder or whatever, but you'll find it's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3993" target="_blank">01:06:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">will be much more productive soon enough because you can replicate things quickly. You can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=3998" target="_blank">01:06:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">script things, you can copy and paste things and so forth. Anyway, so here's my, here's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4003" target="_blank">01:06:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">my computer. It's going to sit here running until you tell it not to. Even if you turn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4014" target="_blank">01:06:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">your computer off, your server is still running and that means you're still paying for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4018" target="_blank">01:06:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So one of the things I guarantee you're going to learn the hard way by wasting money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4024" target="_blank">01:07:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is that you're going to forget to turn it off. Okay. So to turn it off, you're just going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4030" target="_blank">01:07:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to go stop instance. Okay. So you make sure you do that. All right. Let's see how we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4040" target="_blank">01:07:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">going here. So we've launched our instance and we SSH into it. Okay. So keeping a Linux</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4058" target="_blank">01:07:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">server up to date and running used to be kind of annoying, but luckily I've created something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4068" target="_blank">01:07:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">called fast set up for you, which makes it easy. And all you need to do is copy this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4075" target="_blank">01:07:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and paste it into your terminal. And this is one of the really cool things about Linux</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4079" target="_blank">01:07:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and using bash is like in windows or with Mac finder, you'd have pages and pages of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4085" target="_blank">01:08:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">click this and drag that and scroll here. But I've just scripted the whole thing. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4089" target="_blank">01:08:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just going to go ahead and paste it over here and it's off. Okay. Now what this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4096" target="_blank">01:08:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">going to do is it's going to fully set up this Linux server. It's going to make it automatically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4102" target="_blank">01:08:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">update with the latest software. It's going to configure it all correctly. And so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4111" target="_blank">01:08:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's going to ask a minimum number of questions. So I'm just going to show you the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4114" target="_blank">01:08:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">questions it's going to ask you. It's going to ask for a host name. So a host name is just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4119" target="_blank">01:08:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a more convenient way to access a server. And so you can basically write anything you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4124" target="_blank">01:08:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like as long as it's got at least two dots in it. So I'm going to call this course test</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4130" target="_blank">01:08:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">dot fast dot AI, for example. Okay. And then after an email address. Now the email address</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4139" target="_blank">01:08:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is basically just goes where it's going to send kind of error locks and stuff too. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4144" target="_blank">01:09:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe we'll say info at fast dot AI. Okay. Do you want to set a password? Probably do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4152" target="_blank">01:09:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So hit enter for yes. So I'm going to put in a password. Ask you to type it again. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4163" target="_blank">01:09:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Reboot automatically when required. I'll say yes. And that's it. Okay. So that's all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4169" target="_blank">01:09:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">information that it needed. So behind the scenes. What's actually happening here. Is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4181" target="_blank">01:09:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it's grabbed the latest get repo from fast set up. And it's running this thing called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4188" target="_blank">01:09:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Ubuntu initial.

OK. So many Conda is now installed. So we now have our own Python</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4603" target="_blank">01:16:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">setup. So the last setup step is we have to install drivers for the GPU and Ubuntu actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4614" target="_blank">01:16:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">comes with something that figures out for you what the best drivers are for your device.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4619" target="_blank">01:16:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is just what this step here is.

Look here it says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4624" target="_blank">01:17:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">recommended. OK.

But what I actually recommend is you use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4630" target="_blank">01:17:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that but also the one at the dash server to the end. That's going to make like not install</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4635" target="_blank">01:17:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the stuff for playing computer games or whatever. OK. So let's go ahead and run these lines</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4643" target="_blank">01:17:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of code. This is a bit here. See this is 460 depending on your graphics card. When you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4648" target="_blank">01:17:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">run this you might have some different number.

Oh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4663" target="_blank">01:17:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">pseudo pseudo is a special thing you can add to the front of a command that runs it as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4671" target="_blank">01:17:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">an administrator.

OK. So this is now finished installing the Nvidia</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4834" target="_blank">01:20:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">drivers. Normally at this point people say to reboot but there's actually a magic thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4841" target="_blank">01:20:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you can do which means you don't have to reboot. And the Nvidia provides something called Nvidia</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4849" target="_blank">01:20:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">SMI which will tell you about your installed GPUs. And so if you run it and it pops up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4856" target="_blank">01:20:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">anything at all other than an error it means that you are successfully have your GPUs installed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4861" target="_blank">01:21:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this case we have a Tesla T4. It's currently 36 centigrade in there and the most important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4871" target="_blank">01:21:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">thing to know about is that it has 15 gigabytes of memory of which we're using nothing at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4877" target="_blank">01:21:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">all. And there are no processors currently running on the GPU. So if you're finding something's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4885" target="_blank">01:21:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">going very slowly and you're wondering maybe it's not using the GPU you can always run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4890" target="_blank">01:21:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Nvidia SMI and if it says no running process is found you're not using the GPU. OK. OK.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4899" target="_blank">01:21:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So one more setup step which is we have to install all of the software all of the Python</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4907" target="_blank">01:21:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">libraries needed. So PyTorch, FastAI, Jupyter Notebook and so forth. And so I've created</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4913" target="_blank">01:21:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a package which has that whole lot. It's called Fastbook. If you're if you've used had a condor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4920" target="_blank">01:22:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">or mini condor before you might be surprised who says Mamba rather than condor. You should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4925" target="_blank">01:22:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">definitely use Mamba and not condor. It's way way way faster. So anytime you see something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4931" target="_blank">01:22:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">saying condor install you should instead type Mamba install. It's way faster. OK. So off</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4940" target="_blank">01:22:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it goes. Members now going to install all of the all this Python software getting installed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4946" target="_blank">01:22:26.440</a></span> | <span class="t">for us. PyTorch is well over a gigabyte. So this is going to take a few minutes just because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4955" target="_blank">01:22:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it has to download that that whole thing. And yeah that can take a while. So while this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4961" target="_blank">01:22:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is going do we got any more questions Michael. Do you recommend any software for experiment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4970" target="_blank">01:22:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">tracking. So the most popular experiment tracking software would be TensorBoard and Weights</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4980" target="_blank">01:23:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and Biases. Experiment tracking software is stuff which will basically you can use a faster</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4988" target="_blank">01:23:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">call back and you basically will say train whilst tracking with TensorBoard or train</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=4994" target="_blank">01:23:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">whilst tracking with Weights and Biases. And what it will do is it will kind of create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5000" target="_blank">01:23:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a little database showing you all the training results from all the different experiments</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5006" target="_blank">01:23:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you've run and create some little graphs of them and so forth. Personally I don't use any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5015" target="_blank">01:23:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">experiment tracking software. And the reason I don't is I found that many many many people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5023" target="_blank">01:23:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">just about everybody I know who uses them finds it incredibly distracting. So the trick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5029" target="_blank">01:23:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to training models is don't watch them train. So if you've done any C programming it's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5034" target="_blank">01:23:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">don't watch it compile right. Go and do something else preferably set up your next experiment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5043" target="_blank">01:24:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Experiment tracking software just makes it so tempting to look at all the pretty graphs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5048" target="_blank">01:24:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in my opinion. So I would suggest get it running leave come back when it's done and there should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5058" target="_blank">01:24:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">be a bit of reason you were running that experiment. So check whatever that reason was right. Having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5066" target="_blank">01:24:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">said that if you're really sure you need the services of experiment tracking software</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5073" target="_blank">01:24:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">for what you're doing and there are some things that genuinely need it then I think Weights</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5079" target="_blank">01:24:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and Biases is the best at the moment. I think it's really great. And furthermore they've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5086" target="_blank">01:24:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">hired lots of fast AI alumni and they're super nice people. So definitely recommend that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5099" target="_blank">01:24:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's all the installation. So the last step is just to grab the book the notebooks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5106" target="_blank">01:25:06.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you use something called get clone to grab a repository of code and this is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5111" target="_blank">01:25:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to grab the fast book repository. Paste. So you can see it's saying cloning this repository.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5125" target="_blank">01:25:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you'll now find that there is a fast book directory so you can CD into it. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5134" target="_blank">01:25:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there is our book. OK. So I think something on Anaconda is going slowly so we're not going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5143" target="_blank">01:25:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to wait for it to download. But so I want to show the very last step. But the very last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5148" target="_blank">01:25:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">step is to run Jupyter Notebook and then you'll be able to click on the URL that pops up and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5154" target="_blank">01:25:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it'll bring up something that basically looks just like we saw in Colab. But the nice thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5159" target="_blank">01:25:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is everything you save like everything you do will be remembered. So all of your experiments</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5167" target="_blank">01:26:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">are going to be there. The data sets you download is still there. So on and so forth. So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5177" target="_blank">01:26:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that. So when you're done it will remind you here to as I mentioned before stop your instance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5186" target="_blank">01:26:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can either choose stop in this menu or you can choose stop here. Or personally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5195" target="_blank">01:26:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">what I quite like to do is to run pseudo. Remember pseudo is this thing that runs as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5201" target="_blank">01:26:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">an administrator shut down halt now. And so that shuts it down from here without having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5209" target="_blank">01:26:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to go into the AWS GUI. And there we go. OK. So if we look back at the EC2 here in a moment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5228" target="_blank">01:27:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">this will switch from running state to stop state. OK. So I think that's everything Michael</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxe2mN3kAg&t=5237" target="_blank">01:27:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is there anything else to cover.
