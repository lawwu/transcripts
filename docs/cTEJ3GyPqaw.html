So a few months back, I started doing episodes on top travel destinations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and the feedback I got from you all was so positive, I'm going to keep it going.

I thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that finally it was going to happen when some close friends of ours got engaged and said their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">wedding was going to be there, but it ended up being scheduled only a couple weeks after our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">youngest daughter was due, so it didn't happen.

Yeah, I mean, it seems</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like you knew everything about Japan, you know everything about Iceland. There are even other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">countries you know everything about, so I'll probably have you back. But what is it about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Iceland that makes it a kind of place that you would want to learn everything there is to know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">about the country? Well, I think I approach travel in thinking about a destination qualitatively and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">quantitatively. And so for me, doing Iceland was really, really rewarding when I was writing The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Lonely Planet Guide because I would finish a trip, like six, seven months in the country,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'd go, "Okay, I have actually seen everything. I've been to every single place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I have vetted everything that there is to do.

And so there was a great amount of sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of quantitative satisfaction that I had seen everything, and then I could kind of pivot to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the quality and then troubleshoot exactly what a perfect trip for any type of traveler and any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">length of trip would be like. Okay, but what is it about Iceland? What makes it so special?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">On my first trip to Iceland, I learned a lot of Icelandic words, which I think is important,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and we'll get to that soon.

And then "krÃ¦ma"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is simmering as in creativity, the spirit of the local people, the imagination they have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the cool design, the music.

And I would say the first thing to remember is if you're going to math your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">trip, 20-25% of your trip should be in Reykjavik, and the rest should be out in nature. I think a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of people do the opposite, where they base themselves in Reykjavik and then do trips out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">into the nature. You need to keep your time in Reykjavik to around that 20-25%. So a 4-day trip,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">do 1 night in Reykjavik.

And when you read a lot about Iceland,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of online sources get it wrong.

And if you can nail that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=3386" target="_blank">00:56:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">people will be really impressed. So I would work on that before you arrive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=3389" target="_blank">00:56:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">A few things like on signs that you want to check out to kind of understand that there's a few extra</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=3398" target="_blank">00:56:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">letters in the Icelandic alphabet. So there's the EÃ°, which is like a D with a slash in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=3404" target="_blank">00:56:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is pronounced like a Ãž. And then there's ÃžÃ³rn, which is like a P, but the cup of the P</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=3413" target="_blank">00:56:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">is like a little bit lower. It's sort of in the middle of the stem. And that's a Ãž, like thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=3418" target="_blank">00:56:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's a O with an umlaut that's like Ã˜. And then a double L is actually like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=3429" target="_blank">00:57:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the T-L in kettle. So Fjall is like F-J-A-L-L, or like there's a place called Hetlisandur.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=3439" target="_blank">00:57:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not Hellesander, it's Hetlisandur. And it's little things like that, that if you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=3445" target="_blank">00:57:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">get them right, like an H and a V has like a K sound. So there's a town outside of Reykjavik</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=3452" target="_blank">00:57:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">called Hveragerdi, but it starts with an H.

It's Hveragerdi.

The J is like a Y. So again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=3472" target="_blank">00:57:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the word for mountain, Fjall is F-J-F-J-A-L-L-T-L.

So when you're talking about places to go and landmarks and stuff like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=3492" target="_blank">00:58:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you could just say them.

That's a really good start. If there are three words that you're going to remember,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTEJ3GyPqaw&t=3513" target="_blank">00:58:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">gratitude, I think, is always the most important to express gratitude.
