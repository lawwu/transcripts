do it what do they need to do better what do they what can what can you do what can we all do great question and it was funny to me i was thinking as you're talking about how you know when michelle obama started her let's move campaign it was a blue issue a lot of the people who were like pushing this agenda was shelly pingree who's a democrat from maine or mcgovern to mcgovern who's from massachusetts or cory booker introduced all these bills about food safety like the last congress and all of a sudden it's like it flipped and became a republican issue which is staggering to me and we now see bills and you know a few dozen states or more actually now every day i hear about new bills that are helping push forward an agenda to fix our food system and before you dive in i will i just want to see this answer with one thing forgive me audience they don't like it when i interrupt but the goal of the left if i may seems to be to make anyone associated with health and maha on the right a jock not a scientist yeah that's what i'm seeing they're trying to take away their science credential yeah and make them a jock now bobby kennedy is not a formerly trained scientist but um the scientists that are going into nih directorships who i can't share who they are besides jay it's been announced the other ones but you know who they are yeah these are serious scientists yeah these aren't jocks no these are people that may or may not lift weights these are but but there seems to be this effort to say we're going to we're going to strip maha of its power by making it a bro science biohacking jock thing real science is about reductionist stuff and i just say listen it's all it's all valuable yeah and so i'm i'm fundamentally frustrated and it hasn't even begun so educate us i mean listen you know uh my friend rick warren said i'm not left wing or right wing i'm for the whole bird otherwise you'll fly around in circles i like that and who said that rick warren you know who's rick warren is the head of saddleback church which is an evangelical church in southern california i we did a whole program with this church where we got a 15 000 people to lose a quarter million pounds in a year by doing health together in groups and it was it was amazing actually i love that quote it was a great quote and and you know health isn't red or blue or purple it's like a human issue and it's to make to make it partisan it doesn't make any sense to me and yet we live in a partisan world and anything the democrats do the republic is going to hate anything the republicans do the democrats are going to hate it's like hey guys can't we just talk to each other and have civil discourse and agree on the things we can agree on and disagree on the things we're going to disagree agree on and i and i know that i know behind the scenes there's collaboration bipartisan on these issues there's bipartisan caucus that well on the psychedelic issue i was at a meeting where you know governor rick perry former governor rick perry texas like who describes himself as a knuckle-dragging republican those are rick's words by the way rick's a very nice guy and there were several members of the the dems there and you got rick doblin who is like a you know counterculture uh conscientious objector during the vietnam war and they're all up there being proponents for psychedelics for the treatment of ptsd and veterans so they've joined hands yeah i think that's one area that's very exciting yeah it's not happening in nutrition no it's not happening on this thing of get exercise those have become red labels yeah it's unfortunate because you know americans are suffering you know americans are really suffering those 93 percent of us have some metabolic dysfunction psychiatric illnesses on the rise in both kids and adults autoimmune diseases are skyrocketing obviously obesity is a huge problem diabetes is a huge problem you know heart disease deaths are going down but the incidence is going up meaning you're there's more people getting it but because we have better treatments they don't die from it same thing with cancer so we're not winning on the health front in the war on on chronic disease we're losing disastrously and so we have to come together as a country to solve this and it's unfortunate men polarized i think i think the good part about um covid was that people became aware that this edifice of science and medicine had cracks in it and that they needed to be more empowered around their own health and to start questioning things and i think that's part of the genesis of this bigger wider movement around make america healthy again and why bobby kennedy was able to catalyze a huge base he was democratic candidate at first then he was independent now he's in the republican administration it doesn't mean he's shares all the ideology that they have but he cares about this issue and so i think i think what's happening and behind the scenes is there's a lot of bipartisan interest in how do we begin to address this look the health care bill is five trillion dollars of that the government federal government pays forty percent it's one in three federal tax dollars so one in three dollars you paid for your taxes goes to health care of that eighty percent is mostly for chronic disease that's either preventable or reversible through intensive lifestyle therapy and and you know some things are on the margins if insurance is private how does that work like how is it that my money is going to take care of somebody who has for example heart disease for example like like if you get on to medicare advantage and that's that's a government program but it's administered by humana or by cigna or by these insurance companies kind of deploy federal resources to deliver health care but if you actually look at the end-to-end with medicare medicaid indian health service federal employees children's health program you just add up all the things that the government pays for it's it's almost two trillion dollars a year for for health care most people don't realize that so the government has enormous levels and when i was sitting in my office treating my patients who are you know just endless stream of people with chronic illnesses coming diabetes obesity autoimmune disease this that the other thing i'm like why is this patient sick well it's mostly because of the food they're eating and if that's the problem then what's the cause of the food they're eating well it's our food policies and what's the cause of our food policies it's the food industry that has pressured our government to into creating a food system that's harming us and we have very different policies than they do in europe for example they don't allow many gmo foods or glyphosate they don't know they have those high fructose corn syrup they have it there but it's limited i mean more limited there's toxins there's 10 000 additives to food in america there's 400 that are allowed in europe so</p></div></div></body></html>
