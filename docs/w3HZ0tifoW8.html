This is important for all of us to realize, all of us, because all of us do fall</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3HZ0tifoW8&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">short in some parts of God's instruction while succeeding at other parts, and those successes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3HZ0tifoW8&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">never justify the failures. Let me give just an example from the scriptures of what I mean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3HZ0tifoW8&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul wrote to the Corinthians, and he began in chapter one with lavish praise. He said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3HZ0tifoW8&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">verse four, "I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that's been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3HZ0tifoW8&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">given you in Christ Jesus, that in every way you are enriched in him in all speech and all knowledge,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3HZ0tifoW8&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">even as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you." Wow, I would like to be such a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3HZ0tifoW8&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">beneficiary of that kind of praise. And in chapter 11, verse 17, he says, "But in the following</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3HZ0tifoW8&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">instructions I do not commend you because when you come together it is not for the better but for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3HZ0tifoW8&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">worse."

No. Of course a person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3HZ0tifoW8&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">who disagrees with me about complementarianism may agree with me about Christian hedonism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3HZ0tifoW8&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">He won't flesh it out in all the same details of relational dynamics that I do, but the fundamental</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3HZ0tifoW8&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">truths can be joyfully embraced.

That's my summary of Christian hedonism. In fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3HZ0tifoW8&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say one final thing. Every time any of us embraces any aspect of biblical truth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3HZ0tifoW8&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it can have a salutary refining effect on the rest of what we believe. That is, it will sooner</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3HZ0tifoW8&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">or later exert an influence toward truth in every area of our thinking and our living. That's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3HZ0tifoW8&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">nature of the coherence of truth. At least that's the effect I hope it has on me. I hope that every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3HZ0tifoW8&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">refined or clarified or new truth that I embrace has the effect of correcting other areas of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3HZ0tifoW8&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">life because of how truth is of a seamless fabric. So I would happily commend Christian hedonism</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3HZ0tifoW8&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to everyone, no matter what view of manhood and womanhood they hold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3HZ0tifoW8&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">>>Amen.
