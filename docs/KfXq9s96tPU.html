you might interact with another human engineer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.860</a></span> | <span class="t">architecturally this is really different from something that runs locally on your computer Devon is a cloud AI agent and what we've seen is that it's very complimentary to these local AI development tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">when you are coding yourself and you want to stay in flow and get that speed up you use a local AI development tool where people use Devon is when they're really ready to delegate the task entirely and this is a very different set of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">technical trade-off you get large-scale parallelism asynchronousness and the ability to completely delegate individual units of work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in the team setting this also means that Devon's run remotely not locally and so they share the same environment across different runs so you can try many different things in parallel combine them together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and the teams of engineers who use Devon will break up large-scale engineering outcomes into small individual tasks delegated to a fleet of Devons and then coalesce together inside the code base</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and the main thing our users look for is for that code from Devon to get merged as pull requests</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it also changes the learning model for Devon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in the cloud AI agent setting Devon is not just for you it's for your team and for your organization</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and so as Devon learns from your interactions those learnings are not kept only with you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">instead they're incorporated as part of your team and as part of your organization</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and this reliance on organizational knowledge is something that we've seen is really important for working with existing large-scale code bases</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">because working with large code bases is really hard and so I'm going to go into some more detail on exactly how we do this under the hood with Devon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">part one is all about context if you want to build an AI software engineer you need to understand existing code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't want your AI code contributions to be using a new framework adding new dependencies or being done in isolation of what you already have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and code base understanding is pretty hard LLMs are amazing at so many things but they have limited context windows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and even if a code base fits inside the context window the effective context window is often a lot lower than the advertised context window</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we have a series of internal benchmarks that measures effective reasoning capacity across a context and we find very consistently that the advertised context window is much higher than the effective reasoning context window</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Large code bases also have complex dependencies they can span multiple services multiple repositories and it can be intertwined in very complicated ways even for human engineers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">there's huge variations in code quality there might be some parts of the code base you want Devon to emulate and some parts you really want Devon to stay away from when it's learning how to be a productive member of your team</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">same thing is true for documentation the code might have comments might have comments might have documentations that's outright incorrect or misleading</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">all of these things are part of the technical challenges we work on to make Devon work in real world code bases</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the last critical piece of real world code bases is that the larger the code base the more custom it tends to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">teams and companies build their own proprietary frameworks they have their own specific jargon there's context in the code that's not inside the code itself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">but the organizational workflow around the code and so these are the research questions that we set out to solve to make Devon actually useful in the real world</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and the first thing I'm going to go into more detail on is something we actually recently released free and publicly for all open source repositories</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it's called deep wiki deep wiki is a real-time continually updated index of your code base published as an interactive wiki almost like a real-time confluence page with documentation diagrams</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and the ability to ask questions about your code we had this originally as an internal data structure for Devon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it wasn't a it wasn't a product it was just a tool that Devon could use to get high-level context about the code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and what we realized is that human engineers wanted to see this information too and so we decided to release it as a standalone product and service</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">so you can take any github URL today and just change the github to deep wiki.com and for any open source repo you'll get a full interactive wiki</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this also works on your private repos when they're integrated with Devon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and so I looked at the Langchain repo and we have a full updated up-to-date documentation page for Langchain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that has not only the pros of how it's organized the key concepts in Langchain's code base but also architectural diagrams and data flows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and we've gotten a lot of feedback from the community that these diagrams are in some cases or in many cases actually better than the diagrams of the official documentation of very popular open source projects</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">right whether it's folks who are on the typescript steering committee the vllm maintainers or others we're getting lots of amazing feedback on how great deep wiki is and we've had you know thousands of code bases start linking to deep wiki as part of their official documentation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">so definitely check this out if you're working on open source code yourself how does this work under the hood we just said that lms are really bad at raising about large code bases</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">so let's give you the high-level algorithm of what we're doing under the hood to generate these wikis</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.080</a></span> | <span class="t">step one it's actually not about the code it's about the concepts what are the key principles inside this code base that are going to form our table of contents for how we lay out the macro context of this code base</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and what we found is that the in many cases those concepts um you don't just get them from the source code itself there is extremely rich information in the metadata around the source code for example was that source code added in as part of a pull request</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">well which member of the team added that pull request what else have they contributed to was there discussion in that pull request about the code um what were are there comments is there documentation the git commit history all of this metadata</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">data is a really useful source for building these high context wikis once you have those concepts then you can connect them to the code so what are the connections between the various code files and the proprietary or specific concepts inside this code base</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and after you have that you need to connect the code itself there's different sections of the code base uh you know some files that are more related less related</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">there's uh call you know sort of call traces and flows and there's a specific way that these different components of the code base connect to each other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=546"

those code to code connections then you can actually generate a wiki and for each concept what we do is we use an agent to go research that concept in the context of the specific code

target="_blank">00:09:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and when you put this all together uh you get very rich representations of code uh and we use graphs as a critical part of those representations uh and so this is a graph of uh the lang chain code base where you can see uh at a high level that different files are more or less related to each other uh with a lot of a lot of logic in the core and then maybe outskirts that are more related to test harnesses documentation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=593"

really useful recommendations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">um and

target="_blank">00:18:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it's very feasible to outperform an out-of-the-box foundation model especially as the open source based models that you start with have improved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to actually make this work in practice it's important that you keep your model doing what you actually want it to do and not cheating along the way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1154" target="_blank">00:19:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and this is called reward hacking in rl and it's uh many cases actually challenging to prevent so i want to show you a few ways that kevin misbehaved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">uh that we had to sort of steer back so one is kevin realized that it could write the cuda and then wrap the whole thing in a try except block</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and just fall back to the existing pi torch implementation and you know it would always score 100</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">percent correct in that case and it had some chance of being faster than average but if it wasn't it it sort of defaulted to the one x</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1182" target="_blank">00:19:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">so that was a very unproductive direction for for kevin to go down during the rl process and uh we had to make sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that we update the reward function to recognize this type of reward hacking the second is even a bit more subtle uh and so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the test harness to make sure that kevin's code was correct uh had a class you know in this case called model new uh that inherited</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1204" target="_blank">00:20:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">from model and you can see here what kevin realized is that it could implement the model as a uh you know as a subclass of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">nn.module with its attempt at optimize code code and then it could just overwrite that uh class name in the namespace</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and so you can see it defined a second model new that this in this case just inherits directly from the correct</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1225" target="_blank">00:20:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">model implementation so these models got very creative at all uh how to sort of get around your intentions and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1231" target="_blank">00:20:31.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this is a challenge in rl and so making sure you correctly define your environment is is really critical to success</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1237" target="_blank">00:20:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and for those of you who have used maybe really popular commercial models like some of the most popular models for coding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1242" target="_blank">00:20:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you might have seen that as the models get better sometimes they're more aggressive at doing things like commenting out your test cases</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1249" target="_blank">00:20:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to make sure the works will pass that's what's going on under the hood is this is uh this is a smell of reward hacking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1257" target="_blank">00:20:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and so it's a constant sort of cat and mouse game between the researchers who are trying to steer these models to do what we actually want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and the models they're trying to exploit every possible way to get this high quality reward</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">so what do we learn from this um custom post training can and does outperform frontier models on specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">narrow domains for reinforcement learning specifically um especially in code it's more compute bound than data bound</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you know kernel bench the subset of kernel bench that we trained on only had 180 tasks which is really not that many when you think about it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.080</a></span> | <span class="t">but by applying high compute rl rolling out these trajectories again and again there is very very rich reward signal to learn from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's because in software we have an oracle that can help with these rewards we actually have the environment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we can run the code we can see if it compiles we can see how fast it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1306" target="_blank">00:21:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and this in my opinion is one of the reasons that um software and coding specifically has accelerated particularly fast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1313" target="_blank">00:21:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">as an ai capability is that code is one of the few domains where this property holds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">i used to lead machine learning at scale ai which provides post training human data for many of the large scale foundation model labs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1325" target="_blank">00:22:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and it gets really hard to label by hand high quality high accuracy data as the models get smarter but code doesn't have that bottleneck</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1333" target="_blank">00:22:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">because you can continually scale um based on automatic signals of correctness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1339" target="_blank">00:22:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's really the third key is automatic verification allows you to scale</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1343" target="_blank">00:22:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">so for your own code bases and your own process putting in the ci systems putting in the test coverage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1348" target="_blank">00:22:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">putting in the harnesses that allow that automatic verification is going to future proof your code as rl and as ai gets better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1355" target="_blank">00:22:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and we see many of our users of devin they first take their code base with devin and go fix all the test coverage issues</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and now that they have full test coverage it's even faster to use devin to ship new more pull requests</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the last big point here is i just showed you an example on cuda kernels</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">but to me the the more interesting deeper implication of this research is every code base is in some sense a narrow domain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">there are specific things to your code that don't exist in anyone else's code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1384" target="_blank">00:23:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's more and more true the larger your code base is so you can imagine a future where high compute rl and per code base customization leads to significantly outperforming agents on each individual domain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the equivalent of hiring a software engineer and giving them millions of years of experience working specifically in your environment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">so this is some of the research work we've been doing at cognition that powers devin under the hood</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfXq9s96tPU&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">if you'd like to play around and try this yourself you can use you can
