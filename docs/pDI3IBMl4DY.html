So they had basically, call it three or four days of the vaccine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=524">00:08:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to trigger an immune response in their system and that protected them.

All I took, okay, was Tylenol to control the fever,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=544">00:09:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and I took Flonase to reduce the sinus congestion.

And I think new data is coming out. So, I saw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=603">00:10:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">an executive from a pharmaceutical company a few days ago who broke down some statistics that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=612">00:10:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">looked at in Israel. Yeah. And they were like, "Oh, this is a good thing. This is a good thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=613">00:10:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a good thing."

And so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=640">00:10:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">he said, "The more recent vaccinations, we're not seeing any of that."

So, the more recently you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=647">00:10:47.860</a></span> | <span class="t">vaccinated, the less likely you are to have this. And then I met with a pretty well-known</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=655">00:10:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">virologist a few days ago as well, who highlighted for me that we are seeing antibody titers decline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=662">00:11:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">over time in people. But there's other studies that are showing, which means that the antibodies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=668">00:11:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">against COVID in your blood after you get the vaccine slowly go down over time. So, we're seeing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=672">00:11:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">that. We knew that, right?

But there was another study that showed that memory B cells, B cells are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=679">00:11:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">the immune cells that make antibodies, and they remember the antibodies to make. And they were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=683">00:11:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">worried, are we losing those B cells in the human body? And another study found, actually, they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=688">00:11:28.180</a></span> | <span class="t">in your lymph nodes. So, they went in, they pulled them out, and they identified, "Look,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=691">00:11:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">these B cells are persistent.

But what they said was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=751">00:12:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, "We're not ready to kind of commit to doing booster shots for a couple of reasons. One</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=757">00:12:37.900</a></span> | <span class="t">is there are a lot of people out there that haven't had their first shots. And we're seeing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=763">00:12:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the people that are having these breakthrough infections almost universally, not always,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=769">00:12:49.060</a></span> | <span class="t">but very large majority having very mild symptoms and not getting hospitalized,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=773">00:12:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and the death rate is still very, very low." In other words, the vaccine did its job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=778">00:12:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">The vaccine didn't prevent, you know, an infection, meaning that the virus starts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=783">00:13:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">replicating in a way that's uncontrolled in your body, but that your immune system had enough of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=787">00:13:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">a defense to keep it from causing severe disease in your body. 99% of the people going to the hospital</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=793">00:13:13.240</a></span> | <span class="t">are unvaccinated, right? Exactly. And so, we're seeing that great success still with the vaccine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=800">00:13:20.260</a></span> | <span class="t">but they are seeing and there are now studies that, you know, I think reference to your earlier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=804">00:13:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">point that, you know, if you put a different RNA strain, RNA sequence into your body, which Moderna</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=811">00:13:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and Pfizer have slightly different, you know, sequences, you end up creating different antibodies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=815">00:13:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and having more diversity of antibodies can kind of provide greater immunity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=820">00:13:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's almost certain we're going to get boosters,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=823">00:13:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and that we're going to end up seeing them hit the market next month in September. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=826">00:13:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Is the booster different than the original? So, for example, if I get a Pfizer booster,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=832">00:13:52.300</a></span> | <span class="t">am I only basically getting still an expression of that RNA strand that I'm supposed to basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=839">00:13:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like is it the same formulation, the same dosage?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=842">00:14:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, both of those options are still up in the air. And so, we may still get the same vaccines that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=848">00:14:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">were getting before.

And so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=857">00:14:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">all the pharma companies are proposing both approaches, and they're pursuing both paths</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDI3IBMl4DY&t=863">00:14:23.260</a></span> | <span class="t">right now.
