So I think we have five good calls. Jesse, why don't you start us off? What is our first call about?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Our first call is from Kobe. He's looking to be a hedge fund manager, but a big part of his job is convincing people, like selling his work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But he also wants to schedule his time more where he's like focusing on himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he has a question about that. So we'll see what he has to say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That sounds good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, Kyle. My name is Kobe Amponso. First off, I want to say thank you for all the work you've been doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's been extremely powerful and impactful in my life. So I appreciate you for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I encourage you to keep going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My question is, I have a stock investing program and the goal of my program is to really educate beginners on how to use leverage stock investing to increase their income potential.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm finding that I'm getting to a point where I feel like I have to convince people to do something that would really benefit their lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And normally it's people approaching me. And, you know, part of the problem is that maybe I'm not doing as good of a job as connecting their problem to my solution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That might be part of it. But the other side is that I'm spending all this time trying to convince people to join the program when I could be sharpening my sword and maybe even increasing my income potential.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. Learning never stops. So I'm sure you know that as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So is it better for me to continue trying to find a way to get to these customers in a better way?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or do I just sharpen my sword, focus on myself and then have them follow me afterwards?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I do have a goal of becoming a hedge fund manager and I'm working towards that. So that might be a route that I want to take.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just wanted to know your thoughts on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, Kobe, I am going to lean towards your instinct here of focusing more on yourself and your performance and being so good that you can't be ignored.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's almost always going to be the right approach in these situations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Selling is important, right? You do have to sell if you're in any type of industry where you need to get clients.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're spending too much time selling, especially in something like this, I would be worried that that is a signal that's telling you that you need to go back to the woodshed or back to the sword sharpening stone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if what you're trying to sell here is stock lever stock investing, first of all, become richer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, this is the irony of what you're selling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What's going to make this appealing to people to buy is going to be when you get to the situation where you don't need them to buy it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I know that sounds kind of circular, but if you're saying there's all the success you can have financially by doing leveraged stock buying, then people need to see that you're having a lot of success doing it, which will lower the pressure for you to do the selling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you'll be doing fine financially anyways, that's going to add more authenticity to what you're selling because you're producing something you believe in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're not trying to push a lot of different students into it. You'll gravitate more students towards you in that situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then more generally, what I would say is keep in mind the concept from my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You, which is the law of financial viability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was an idea that I borrowed from the entrepreneur Derek Sivers, who said money and people's willingness to give it to you is a good neutral indicator of value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So how do you know, for example, if your course is good or not? How easily are people giving you money to take it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it's a real struggle, think about that as being a real honest return.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not right. It's not there yet. I mean, maybe they're picking up like, why is Kobe not more successful himself?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or there's something about the quality of the course. And it's a really important signal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's what I would say. Sharpen your sword to use your terminology. Get better at what you're doing. Hone your system. Have demonstrable results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Keep polishing and improving that course. Put the word out there. I mean, you want people to know it's there, but don't push super hard to sell it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What you want to see is that relative signal of it's easier to get the people I'm getting. More people are coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">With less effort, I'm hitting a mark that I used to have to really push to before. And that'll be your signal that this is getting better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That the course is getting to a place that maybe is worth having even more energy pushed into.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So thanks for that question, Kobe. All right, Jesse, what do we have on the docket next?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Our next question is from Pablo. He's got a two part question. His first is he wants your thoughts on how to persuade his girlfriend to minimize social media.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, man. And he should read your news article about the Twitter in January.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then part two is he actually has a question about his bodybuilding and if that counts as high quality leisure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesse, how many girlfriends you think are out there in the world right now who curse my name because their nerd boyfriend is pushing some Cal Newport idea and they finally just say enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Enough. I don't want to hear about. I don't want to hear about Cal Newport. I think I've been cursed in apartment buildings and living rooms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">More now that your Today Show appearance. So all those. That's right. There's a big audience there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right. Well, yeah, now that I'm world famous from being on the Today Show, it's only going to make this problem worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that I wear suit jackets to work, I'm going to start wearing a suit jacket on air for this podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I think you should, too. I think it's just about showing people that we're pros. A suit jacket and tie.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I never used my ties in my closet, so maybe it'd be good excuse to put them on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, we could do like the Lexford Mint thing, like wear the same suit every time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, here's Pablo. All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hi, Cal. First and foremost, thank you for drastically improving my quality of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted to ask two questions to start. I want to know your thoughts on how I can harmoniously persuade my girlfriend into minimizing her social media use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And lastly, would you count pain inducing bodybuilding workouts as high quality leisure?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Greetings from Santa Cruz, Bolivia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, Pablo. So for the first question, minimizing social media use, how to encourage someone else in your life to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's dangerous waters. Dangerous waters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you're trying to tell someone else about an improvement you think they should make, regardless of what the topic is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think anyone who's been in a relationship knows this experience. It's usually not going to go well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have to be very careful there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I usually recommend that what people do is be the change they want to see in the world, where you can replace world with spouse or boyfriend or girlfriend or kids or what have you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Be the change you want to see. So first of all, live your life in the way that you think is valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Use the phone for your method. Don't have your phone with you. Don't have social media accounts or the accounts you do use, you use on a schedule on a desktop for very specific purposes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let the other person in your life see what that brings you. The concentration, the peace, the lack of anxiety. Let them see that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then be clear when the topic comes up, why and how you're doing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, well, I'm a digital minimalist and this is what digital minimalism is. I've built my life around using this in this way and not that. I'm getting a lot of benefits about it."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they know what's going on. They know why you're doing it and how you're doing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">At that point, then you have to let the seed germinate on its own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to let the other person see what you're doing, know that it's an option, know the philosophy behind it, and make that step of, "Kobe, I think I want to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you want to do it with me? Do you want to help me?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can't push it that hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if you want to be nudging, you can try to do a New Year thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I talked about in a recent episode that this January, when this episode is coming out, January 2022, I've announced on my newsletter an analog January challenge, which was built just around not using Twitter for the month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you might do something like that, built around New Year's resolutions and say, "Hey, do you want to do this with me? I think it'd be fun."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you could try that, but for the most part, be the change you want to see in others and let the others come to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The most extreme alternative to that I've heard is on one of my events I was doing on the digital minimalism tour, I met a parent who was worried about their teenage kids' social media use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they took their devices on a long car trip so they had nothing to look at or listen to and then put digital minimalism audio book on in the car and basically forced them to listen to digital minimalism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that would be the opposite extreme.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And those kids went on to invent TikTok.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that backfired.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Second question, bodybuilding as a high-quality leisure activity.</span></div><div

bodybuilding, but exercise, etc, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a really intense, complicated, high-quality leisure activity, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">100%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, even looking at, I was a big fan of Arnold's biography and some of the stuff that he's put out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he said, you know, when he was training, like when he was in his 20s and stuff, like going in there was like doing deep work for you do five hours a day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He broke it up in the morning and the afternoon, but I would think 100% that would count.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, no, that sounds good to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I just watched that biography on, I think it was on Netflix, of Ronnie Coleman, who was the six or seven time Mr. Universe, a huge guy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now his whole body's broken down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He can't walk and he's in constant pain because he's lifting such heavy weights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But that looked pretty deep to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That looked pretty deep to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, Pablo, I think that's great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, I like that it's different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're using different parts of your brain than like your normal work or your other types of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think there's probably a clarity that comes to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, look, when people see me, they're like, this is a guy who knows about bodybuilding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're often coming to me for advice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you look at me, you think super athlete, you think steroids, you think that's a guy who knows his way around the gym.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm not surprised you asked me, asked me this question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, that's deep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Go for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, I'm going to ask you another question to his part too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot of these bodybuilders, a lot of people who lift and whatnot, what's your view on them having earphones in and listening and stuff while they're lifting?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because a lot like Arnold talks about like really thinking about the muscle and like feeling it and feeling it grow and stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you could be distracted if you have other things in your ears.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was just wondering to know your thoughts on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've read about that somewhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you might know more about it, but it seems to be true that because of the mind muscle connection that really concentrating on the muscle that you're trying to exhaust or contract to do the reps on makes a difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I mean, is this the case you would know this, Jesse, more than me?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this the case for serious weightlifters that the concentration on the muscle aspect of what they do is key?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">100%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Arnold totally believes in that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was, I think, a big, because he was so disciplined, he could focus on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that helped him when he was training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I said it in my personal life by just not wearing headphones anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, sometimes you're at the gym, there might be music on and whatnot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't really help that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've kind of always thought about what your thoughts on that were.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I suspect, I'm just thinking about this out loud, but I suspect doing that type of training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're doing muscle training, but you're giving full concentration to the contraction because it helps is probably fantastic, general, deep work calisthenics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, in other words, if you're doing that on a regular basis as part of a fitness routine, you're going to be able to concentrate on a book better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to be able to concentrate when you're walking and trying to hold a thought in your head better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a good point, Jesse, because I think Pablo, actually, I'm going to go beyond now and say not only does that count as high quality leisure, doing serious weight training might actually be a fantastic way of improving your general ability to concentrate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you have all the other advantages that's different than the other type of thinking you do so that you get that relaxation and anxiety reduction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, look, I'm picking up my fitness this January as well. I don't like the dark. I don't like the dark weather.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'll see if that has a difference, but it's a good point. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a good tool in the deep work toolkit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, what do we got?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Next question.

Curious for your tips and thanks for all you do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, Carson. Well, first of all, I think we're going to now refer to time blocking as as seen on NBC's The Today Show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Time block planning. That's just a little bit of branding strategy there. Second of all, you have a fantastic voice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you should sell things. You should team up with Kobe from earlier in this episode who is trying to sell the stock investing tip lessons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, Carson, if it was you reading these lessons, I think we'd all be all in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you'd be like. I want you to mortgage your house, invest that money into crypto.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And everybody like, yeah, makes sense. Man, man knows what he's talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to let me just mortgage that house over there. So great voice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Use that. Use that to your advantage. I have two things to suggest for what you're talking about here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, very common problem. Time blocking is hard. Blowing past blocks or ignoring blocks is something that happens all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of it has to do with what's happening in your head, the pain of context shifting, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one. Schedule less. You're probably being too ambitious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You have multiple buckets of different type of work you want to be doing on your dissertation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It sounds like you're trying to do all this work every day. I think you're being too ambitious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Your brain might be just crying uncle when it switches to the bills or becomes more linguid in its pace on the research and lets it overlap into the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So think about doing less. Be very regular. I'm going to work on this every day, but I'm going to be less ambitious about how much I'm going to work on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe I'm doing one thing every day. So I just do that thing and I have some flexibility around it if it runs long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's it for the dissertation. Two, I'm going to say you want to ritualize this better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this has to be when I say ritual, I mean in terms of timing, setting and activity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So for something like this, I am working on a hard long term project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to want to use the same times if possible, probably first thing in the morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1067" target="_blank">00:17:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In deep work, I have a couple examples, especially one in particular I'm thinking of a Brian who would did his dissertation at 5 a.m.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like 5 a.m. to 6.30 a.m. heavily ritualized every morning. He had a full time job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">5 a.m. to 6.30 a.m. dissertation. And that just the same time, same day was heavily ritualized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then setting. So where do you do this work? Same time, same place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Brian had this dank office in the basement that he used, but it was perfect because he only used it for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then activity. Again, using that same example of Brian from deep work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he was down to a specific time he would make coffee and how he would make the coffee and when he would drink the coffee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I believe he even had like the bathroom break programmed in. So it's very ritualized activity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All of this, all of this, what it does is break down the context switching cost in your brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It makes it much easier for your brain to a not have to negotiate with itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Should we work now? It's a hard argument, waste energy, you might lose it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So just take that off the table and be the rituals, get you into that mode quicker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you don't have as much of an expensive context shift operation happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1134" target="_blank">00:18:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you waste less energy on that. You get into it quicker, you get into it easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So do less. And to be much more ritualized about the work you do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a core principle of slow productivity is. Change the scale at which you're looking for accomplishment to be longer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not what did I get done today? It's am I happy with the chapter I produced this month?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1158" target="_blank">00:19:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to a larger time scale and then it's just about clean, deep, reasonable, sustainable work again and again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Head down, the wheel is grinding. You look up three months later and say, hey, this first part of my dissertation looks pretty good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. What do we have for our fourth call, Jesse?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1179" target="_blank">00:19:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Before we get to the fourth call, I loved how Carson was first time caller.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1185" target="_blank">00:19:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You get that a lot in sports talk radio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I know. Well, once again, we should do we should do live calls at some point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I maybe we would regret that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I just love the first time caller, first time, long time. You hear it all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel I've heard a few times, like listen to some of your listener calls.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1204" target="_blank">00:20:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I do enjoy it. I do enjoy it. And also the thing I want to do is we should do a we should do one of these live, do it actually live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we should do it like the morning after an important Nationals game and like just let it devolve into sports talk radio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We would be swimming in fans if it just became calls, long discussions, long discussions about the Nationals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1226" target="_blank">00:20:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. The next question is about balancing and balancing ambitious with everyday life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1236" target="_blank">00:20:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, Cal, this is Sam from India. Thanks for your podcast. And I really enjoy it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1242" target="_blank">00:20:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My question to you is that how do you balance ambition with life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1246" target="_blank">00:20:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I see many entrepreneurs and leaders say that they are overly ambitious and have very little time available for life and health related tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1256" target="_blank">00:20:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">On the other side of the spectrum, I see more people having regrets about not meeting their potential.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So how should we find this ambition life balance? Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1269" target="_blank">00:21:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it's a it's a critical question, and I think it's one that we're not necessarily dealing with in a sophisticated manner right now in our in our cultural moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1282" target="_blank">00:21:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The way I read our current moment is that in the first decade of the 2000s, we had a emphasis on crushing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. I mean, this was a time where we were, especially in American culture, lionizing the new wave of tech entrepreneurs and the that burst of the whole like Zuckerberg, Musk, that whole world, Bezos, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1310" target="_blank">00:21:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So we were like into like these people who got after it up all night, moving fast, breaking things, building fortunes, changing the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1319" target="_blank">00:21:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is also the period of like Sheryl Sandberg and lean in. And so there's definitely an emphasis of we were pretty activity oriented.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1329" target="_blank">00:22:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we whipsawed. So now, more recently, we have the anti productivity movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1336" target="_blank">00:22:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've gone hard the other direction and we can look at things like Jenny Odell's book or which was I always miss it up, mix it up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1345" target="_blank">00:22:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's how to do nothing or I think it's how to do nothing or the art of doing. I think it's the how to do nothing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1351" target="_blank">00:22:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then Chelsea Headley had do nothing. There's Berkman's book, which I really enjoy. Four thousand weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1360" target="_blank">00:22:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's there's a pushback in the other direction, which was we shouldn't really be doing things like productivity in general is constructed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And depending on who you talk to, you get different extremes on this. So like I think Berkman has a much more milder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1377" target="_blank">00:22:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Set up to this, which is just like, hey, in general, we're excited about doing two things, but we set our aspirations too high.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And on the other extreme, you have the commentators to think like all of productivity is basically exploitative mythology created by capitalists to oppress the new digital age proletariat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So it gets pretty extreme, but it's more of let's normalize this idea that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1402" target="_blank">00:23:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The drive to do action is all kind of fake anyways, and just you should be OK, just chilling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Do nothing, how to do nothing, et cetera. So we've kind of gone too far the other direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not really working either, because humans like to do things and we like accomplishment and we'd like to make long term plans and execute them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can actually point to the specific sectors of the brain that evolved in humans that we don't share with our primate ancestors that actually help us make those plans and reward them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's what helped our species differentiate. So there's a deeply human aspect of having goals that you then make a plan for and execute and see your manifest your intentions being manifest concretely in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1440" target="_blank">00:24:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So just telling people like, let's just chill. It's important that we normalize that you don't have to be a superhero, but that doesn't do it either.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1449" target="_blank">00:24:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think this question gets right at that tension. So my answer here, this is where I become a bigger believer in this term I've been trying to popularize, slow productivity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is a concept that still is in development. It's embryonic. I change what it means each time I talk about it. So you're seeing this in real time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1471" target="_blank">00:24:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But critical to slow productivity is this idea of yes, seeking out accomplishment, but on larger timescales.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1479" target="_blank">00:24:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Over the next few years, I care about what I produce over the next few years that I've produced some things of real value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you're focused on execution at that slower timescale, it gives you a lot of breathing room and flexibility on the small timescales.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1494" target="_blank">00:24:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you're trying over the next two year period to produce something that you're proud of, a product or a piece of writing, that allows you next Tuesday to just be with your kids and do nothing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1507" target="_blank">00:25:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because on the larger timescale, that one day is not that important.

It's seasonal. It's varied. It's diverse. It fits the rhythms of the human condition. Slow productivity feeds into all of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this is probably the ideal setup for satisfying the human desire to accomplish is that you are working on a small number of important things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjh_Qfw0PlA&t=1535" target="_blank">00:25:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You return to it and you hone your craft and you try to be so good they can't ignore you.
