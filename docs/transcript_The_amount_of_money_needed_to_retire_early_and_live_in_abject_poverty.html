And I know this is a funny title, and you're thinking, what the hell am I talking about now?</p><p>But I wanna highlight the math, because the math doesn't lie. It's really our emotions, our emotions that lie to us and make us believe that we need something or want something or can do something when we really don't need it or don't want it or can't. And so this is a combination of emotion, desire, and the ability to retire early.</p><p>So as more people look to retire early, which I define as under 60 years old, more people are looking for shortcuts in order to get to early retirement quicker. And it's understandable that in this day and age of instant gratification, young folks nowadays aren't willing to grind it out for decades like previous generations.</p><p>Instead of building a large enough passive income portfolio to cover a comfortable lifestyle, I've noticed more people are willing to retire early to live in or near abject poverty. My definition of financial independence or being able to retire early is to have enough investment income to cover your best life's living expenses.</p><p>So you don't have to work, and you can do whatever you want. I think this is a logical definition, but I think people are really not taking this definition seriously. And I can empathize. When I was 25 years old, the terrorist attack of 9/11 happened. This terrible, terrible, terrible event ignited my quarter life crisis.</p><p>I was working in finance. I just got to San Francisco for a new job. And I was seriously thinking about just hanging it all up and retiring with about $400,000 due to some lucky investments and moving to Hawaii to become a fruit farmer on my grandparents' under-maintained farm. It's not, it wasn't a really big farm.</p><p>It was only eight acres in Wai'anae, which is a really rough part of Honolulu or in Oahu. It's probably the roughest part of Oahu, but it was a nice place. There was some pummelo trees, mango trees. It was only about a couple miles from the beach. You could see the beach from the property just a little bit.</p><p>And I was thinking, man, you know what? This could be a good lifestyle in exchange for clearing the brush, watering the trees, and doing general upkeep on a very old and dusty house. I could live for free and make some extra money selling mangoes, papayas, and pummelos down the street.</p><p>Maybe $10,000, I don't know. But then after I thought about it a little bit more, I kind of slapped myself silly and bucked up. Throwing away a perfectly good career in finance at 25 years old was incredibly naive and stupid. It was one of those gotta get your patience down and grind it out because 400,000, even though that sounds like a lot, and it is a lot for someone who's 25 years old, is not enough for a long, long time in my head.</p><p>So I gutted it out for another nine, 10 years until my investments could generate about 80,000 a year and cover my desired living expenses in San Francisco in 2012. So back in 2001, it's important to note that the 400,000 could only generate about 20 to $24,000 in risk-free income.</p><p>And I used the wrong word. It's not only, it's, hey, not bad, 20 to $24,000 a year because the risk-free bond yield, the 10-year bond yield was more around 5 to 5.5%. But today, the $400,000 can only generate about 8,000 to 9,000 a year in risk-free income given the 10-year bond yield has collapsed down to about 2%.</p><p>Therefore, there's no way today I could retire early on 400,000, even if I was a really happy-go-lucky guy and just one person, because the federal poverty limit, as determined by the federal government, for one person is $12,140 a year. So I wanted to use this episode and this post and podcast to talk about the federal poverty level limit.</p><p>So if you go to the post, you'll see a great chart that highlights the federal poverty level limit, 100% up to 400%. And these numbers, these income figures are very important because these income figures are what allow you to get subsidized health insurance, whether you are retired or not.</p><p>So in other words, the government believes that if you make 400% or less of the baseline federal poverty level, you are considered poor enough to receive federal assistance. You are not rich enough to actually pay more to help other people. Let's be honest here. Don't get defensive. Don't get sensitive that I'm saying this.</p><p>This is what the federal government has decided. And to just go through some of these numbers, a household size of one, the federal baseline poverty level limit is 12,140. Household size of two is 16,460. Household size of three, 20,780. Household size of four, 25,105, 29,420. And then 200% of the federal poverty level is double that, basic math.</p><p>So I think the household income levels between 300% to 400% of FPL seem comfortable as long as the household doesn't live in an expensive coastal city like San Francisco, New York, or Los Angeles. For example, I have to imagine a couple with two kids, so a household of four making between 75,300, that's 300% of FPL, to 100,400, which is 400% of FPL, is gonna be able to live a decent, comfortable lifestyle in the heartland of America where I've been aggressively investing in real estate for the past three years.</p><p>Just recently, you heard the University of Texas out of Austin announce families earning less than 65,000 would not have to pay a single dollar of tuition starting in 2020. Meanwhile, families making up to 125,000 would also receive some type of tuition subsidy. So that's really, really great news, and obviously Texas, Austin, and this heartland of America.</p><p>So again, if you're, they're saying you still get subsidies if you make up to 125,000, that's pretty good. However, I argue, as does the government, that any household income between 100% to 200% of FPL is gonna be a little difficult to survive on. It's gonna be difficult to get ahead if that's what you have.</p><p>And even in retirement, I don't think that's enough because of just extraneous expenses that come up, whether it's trying to take care of your parents, taking care of your kids, accidents, healthcare, even though you're gonna get subsidies. Those subsidies, yeah, they're good, but man, there's some huge deductions at the ACA level where you get these subsidies.</p><p>You know, we're talking 5,000, $10,000 subsidies, and that's after tax, which could easily wipe you out. So in a post, I highlight a chart, and I crunch the numbers that shows how big of an after-tax retirement portfolio you need by household size and percentage return if your household income is 100%, which is abject poverty, to 200% of FPL, which is near poverty.</p><p>And so let me just share some numbers with you on this podcast. So in order to retire early and live in a household income equal to 200% of FPL, and a conservative 2% rate of return, or, quote, safe withdrawal rate, it really is safe at 2% because that's the risk-free rate of return right now, you will need to amass 1.214 million as an individual, and up to 3.374 million for a household of six.</p><p>That's a lot, that's a lot, lot, folks. Now, let's say you don't wanna have a household of six, you know, let's say a household of four, you gotta amass about 2.5 million. If you're okay with living in abject poverty, or 100% of FPL, and expect a conservative 2% rate of return or withdrawal rate, then you'll only need to amass 607,000 as an individual, and up to 1.7 million for a household of six.</p><p>If a couple wants to have two children, which is more or less standard nowadays, one and a half to two children, and earn up to 200% of FPL to have more breathing room in early retirement, they need to amass between one million to 2.5 million in an after-tax portfolio based on a 5% down to a 2% withdrawal rate, and so forth.</p><p>So just think about that, folks. If you wanna retire early and live in poverty or near poverty with a family, right, with kids, you're probably gonna need at least a million dollars. So it's kind of backwards. It's kind of a weird thought process. And again, the math doesn't lie.</p><p>It's just the way it is. And given that the risk-free bond yield is at 2%, I would really not use a withdrawal rate of higher than 4%. Yes, we've had a 10-year bull market, and the returns are like 8% to 9% to 10% a year, but do you really expect that to continue?</p><p>And do you really wanna count on those type of returns to continue once you stop working? My answer is no, and I think your answer should be no, too. I would use a safe withdrawal rate or expected compound return rate of around 3%, so 50% higher than the risk-free rate of return.</p><p>And remember, this is just assuming you're gonna steadily make money every single year in your portfolio, whereas in fact, you know that every 10, 15 years, there's like a downturn. 2018, we saw a downturn, right? The markets were down 6%. And obviously, 2008, 2009, the markets were down like 35%.</p><p>So it can get ugly out there, so you don't wanna just count on this steady, unrealistic rate of return. So the question I have for all of you looking to retire early or looking for financial independence is, is it worth living in poverty or near poverty to retire early?</p><p>For the first 13 years of my life, I grew up in emerging countries like Zambia and Malaysia because my parents were in the US Foreign Service. I was surrounded by poverty, and it made me question life, question why I'm studying or why I wanna earn money and what I wanna do with my life, because it's kinda scary.</p><p>I had friends, a couple best friends in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, who would share one room and a bathroom with three other family members. We're talking one room, maybe 400 square feet, maybe 500 square feet, and bunk beds all along the walls, and where they would just hang out on their bunk beds, have lunch, dinner, breakfast in the center of the room, and then just go to the bathroom.</p><p>There was no privacy, nothing. So here in the United States, I mean, we've got it large and we've got it good, and because I saw so much poverty growing up, it just made me afraid of becoming poor. And when I came to America in 1991, I decided not to take my good fortune for granted.</p><p>I was like, you know what? I don't wanna live in a one room with four other people or three other people. I wanna have my own car, I wanna have my own place, and I wanna have some options. So I just hit the books and I just really focused.</p><p>And until this day, at 42 years old in 2019, I'm not taking my good fortune for granted. There is no way, because if I do, I feel like I'm disrespecting the people who don't have the same opportunity. So, even though money doesn't buy happiness, money has to at least cover all our basic living expenses before we can really believe in such an ideology.</p><p>So I personally would not be willing to retire early if I had to live in or near poverty. Although my work in finance was very stressful, and my wife's work in finance was pretty stressful, it allowed us to own a comfortable home in San Francisco. It allowed us to take four to six weeks of vacation a year.</p><p>It allowed us to drive a reasonably safe vehicle, and also it allowed us to potentially raise a family if our son came while we were still working. And these are great things. I mean, the work wasn't that bad. Yeah, there were micromanagers, terrible amounts of pressure and unreasonable clients, but hey, we were living a life that we enjoyed.</p><p>And for the now three of us, since we have a son, to live off only $41,560 a year, or 200% of FPL, that would require us to leave San Francisco and start living with my parents in Hawaii to save on rent. And although plenty of readers have stated they have no problem living at home with their parents as adults, we definitely do.</p><p>Our parents, they're in their 70s. They value their privacy. We're in our late 30s and early 40s. We value our privacy. We're all set in our ways. Living together for an extended period of time would be very, very difficult. And then there's alternatives. Well, one alternative is living a more comfortable early retirement lifestyle by having a higher withdrawal rate.</p><p>But I will tell you that if you spend 10, 20, 30 years saving and investing aggressively, you will feel very odd. It'll be very difficult for you to draw down more or spend more. It's just kind of a weird thing, and I just can't do it. I feel like it's like a sin to withdraw down principle.</p><p>The other alternative, which I think most early retirees do nowadays, is freelance or take on odd jobs to make up for their earnings shortfall. And I think this makes a lot of sense. If you have a wealth of experience, surely you can at least get a minimum wage job doing something that isn't gonna hurt your back or something.</p><p>But where things can get hairy is when the early retiree spends endless hours trying to make extra income because their investment portfolios are too small. So again, it goes back to my definition of what is financial independence and what is being allowed to retire early comfortably, and that is having enough investment income to cover your desired lifestyle's living expenses.</p><p>So if you're just hustling for another 40 to 60 to 70 hours a day trying to make money online or doing something else, you've essentially traded one job for another, and that's fine, but don't pretend like you are financially independent or you've retired, 'cause you're not. And I've personally been accosted by the internet retirement police many, many, many times before over this 10-year journey of Financial Samurai, and they say, "You know what?</p><p>"You're not retired because of Financial Samurai." And I say, "You know what? "You're probably right," which is why I don't tell anybody that I run Financial Samurai in real life. I just say, if they ask, I'm a writer or a high school tennis coach, and then just make them wonder, why do I have so much free time?</p><p>But isn't it funny that if Financial Samurai was a little speck, it still is a speck on the internet, but if it was much smaller, I'd get more approval from the internet retirement police. They would allow me to say that I am an early retiree or whatever, so the lesson here is never stick out because a hammer will try to bang you down.</p><p>In real life, you should be as stealth wealth as possible. Keep low key. So in a post that I wrote about this subject, I highlight a budget on retiring early on 200% federal poverty level limit for a family of three. And that number comes out to about $3,100 a month after a 10% effective tax rate.</p><p>And I don't know, I look at it and I get mad at how little I can spend because I want better for my wife and son. I mean, I think every single parent wants better and because I see how little I can spend. I mean, I'm talking about like $50 a day.</p><p>No, sorry, $50 a month for my boy. You know, I can't even send him to like a Jamboree class 'cause that's like $100 a month. So this budget makes me mad, but it also makes me motivated. And it also makes me realize that I just can't do 200% FPL.</p><p>I need an income of about 300% of FPL or $62,340 in early retirement to feel reasonably comfortable. At a 3% safe withdrawal rate, we therefore need a portfolio of at least $2.1 million. And again, the math doesn't lie. So I want you guys to do the math, to do the math yourself, to be really honest about your budget and your withdrawal rate and how your lifestyle might change over time.</p><p>Don't rush early retirement. Don't rush it because you're feeling this FOMO or seeing other people do it. I can guarantee you that there's a lot of negatives on early retirement and there's a lot of doubt for people who retire too early. One of my big regrets was retiring too early.</p><p>You know, 34, 34 and a half, it's just in retrospect, it's kind of stupid. It really is, folks. I wish I gutted it out for probably two or three more years at least. You know, originally it was to 40, but two or three more years, I would have saved more, earned more, built more passive income.</p><p>And I think it would have been better. But you know what, I can't rewind the past or I can't go back in time. And I can just only advise you folks, you younger folks who are just itching, itching to get out there, just take your time and please, please run the numbers.</p><p>So I did a cool survey, 1,200 votes so far, 1,200 participants, and I asked, are you willing to live in poverty or near poverty so you can retire early? And 72% or 885 votes say no. 72%, that's good. I'm thankful that people are pretty logical. And the second highest vote getter was 13% saying yes, I'm willing to live near poverty.</p><p>That's 200% of FPL so I can retire early, but not in abject poverty or 100% of FPL. So I thought that was interesting, folks. I'm glad I'm reaching out to you guys and trying to make some sense. Nobody can tell you how you can live your life. I'm just telling you, the government has the numbers.</p><p>I've gone through this experience now as a seven plus year unemployed guy with a family. And you might look back if you retire too soon and regret it because you'll be like, well, life wasn't too bad. The health benefits, the income, the security, not so bad. So don't take your work for granted.</p><p>Find ways to improve your work environment or find another job. I'd love to hear from all of you guys and leave me a comment if you got some time. Otherwise, I'll talk to you guys later.</p></div></div></body></html>
