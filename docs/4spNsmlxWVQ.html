href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=127">00:02:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe you could just share with the audience how you wound up speaking at Ted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=134">00:02:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">What the content of your talk was, briefly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=138">00:02:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the bizarre reaction when they tried to ban and kill your talk, post you giving it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=145">00:02:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so first, really glad to be on, guys. I'm a fan of the pod.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=148">00:02:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll give the short version here. If you want the long version, you can go to the free press,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=152">00:02:32.040</a></span> | <span

class="t">Basically what happened is Chris Anderson invited me to give a Ted talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=160">00:02:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I chose the subject of my upcoming book, which is coming out in February,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=165">00:02:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">called The End of Race Politics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=167">00:02:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And the argument is just, essentially, color blindness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=171">00:02:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the idea that you want to treat people without regard to race,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=174">00:02:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">both in your personal lives and in our public policy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=177">00:02:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And wherever we have policies that are meant to collect and help the most disadvantaged,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=183">00:03:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we should preferentially use class

nutshell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=190">00:03:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So I prepared the talk with the Ted team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=193">00:03:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I got their feedback, edited, curated, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=196">00:03:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Got up there in April, gave the talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=199">00:03:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">95% of the people in the audience, it was quite well-received.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=203">00:03:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Whether or not they agreed with every point, it was well within the bounds of acceptable discourse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=209">00:03:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">There was a very small minority on stage, I could see, that was physically upset by my talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=215">00:03:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">On stage?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=217">00:03:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I could see this on stage, yeah, in the moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=219">00:03:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But, I mean, I'm talking five people in a crowd of almost 2,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=223">00:03:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I expected that, because color blindness is not in vogue today on the left, amongst progressives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=232">00:03:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really the idea non

talked to some critics and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=241">00:04:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But what happened is, what began as just a few people upset,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=246">00:04:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">began to

class="t">So this group called Black at Ted asked to speak with me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=256">00:04:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I agreed, and then they said, "Actually, we don't want to talk to you."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=259">00:04:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're an employee group at Ted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=424">00:07:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And he sold it to me as a way to amplify my talk, which I think was kind of some

it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1008">00:16:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I would have gotten there much faster had I not

there's really only one or two sentences that are relevant in terms of explaining this whole thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1399">00:23:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">What he says is that many people have been genuinely hurt and offended by what they heard you say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1407">00:23:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, he's addressing this to Coleman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1409">00:23:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">This is not what we dream of when we post our

mistake that Chris Anderson's making, is that he believes that people can be genuinely hurt by encountering well-reasoned ideas they disagree with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1424">00:23:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the way that the marketplace of ideas is supposed to work is that when you encounter an idea you disagree with, you formulate an equally well-thought-out response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1435">00:23:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And you engage in intellectual discourse and debate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1438">00:23:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, maybe get curious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1439">00:23:59.040</a></span> | <span

are really significant because he's saying not just that the objectors here were offended.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1447">00:24:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">He was saying that they were hurt, genuinely hurt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1450">00:24:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, he's buying into this idea that hearing ideas you disagree with is somehow a threat to your safety.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1457">00:24:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And as soon as you do that, as soon as you concede that there can be some sort of physical harm from engaging with ideas, you give the equivalent of a heckler's veto to the people who don't like these ideas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1473">00:24:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's almost like a crybaby's veto.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1476">00:24:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there's no way you can function as a marketplace of ideas and certainly a platform for ideas worth spreading if you're going to give a veto to people who can claim that their subjective emotional reaction to well-thought ideas should trump the right of the speaker to put out that idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1497">00:24:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Or the broader audience to hear

I have always thought, and maybe I'll just leave this with you, because if you were willing to do it, I for one would love to support you in any way that I could to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1809">00:30:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But we don't have a full accounting of what really happened starting in the late 1960s with LBJ's war on poverty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1818">00:30:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think when you look at racism through the American lived experience, a lot of it goes back to a bunch of economic incentives that were set up to try to do what theoretically seemed at the time the right thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1830">00:30:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We can debate whether that's where LBJ came

decisions forward and to your point, now we're sort of trying to deal with the symptoms without really addressing the root cause.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1841">00:30:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think if America wants to really heal and deal with this, what we also need to do is give all those people that have that fight or flight response, the better toolkit to understand what kind of got us here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1851">00:30:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Because right now we have a very charged way of viewing these things without actually looking at some of the practical, quantifiable details.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1859">00:30:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Thomas

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1868">00:31:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you then compound that with this institutional capture, they get buried.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1873">00:31:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the answer may actually be sitting right in front of our face, where it was the welfare reform system that we implemented in the late 1960s on down the line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1883">00:31:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Because those are structural ways where we can solve it, which ultimately will get to your point, which is great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1888">00:31:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Fund more music in the schools in that example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1891">00:31:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And right now we're so caught up in all of the labels and the fear mongering that we never get to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1896">00:31:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I just wanted to put that out there that I think that there needs to be smart, brilliant people like yourself, young people who can do a full accounting of like the last 50 or 60 years in a much more structural way that these gentlemen tried to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1909">00:31:49.040</a></span> |

<span class="t">But because of formats like podcasts and like the free press and other things, I think there's a chance that you can actually get these ideas out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1918">00:31:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it's important because I think folks like me or the people that approached you, there's not enough of us that came from this background that are open minded or at a point where we can tolerate the anxiety to listen to your ideas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1932">00:32:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of people that may just viscerally react.</span></div><div class="c"><span

tolerating and then thinking and then evolving their point of view, you can do some enormous good in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

And then no, they used to be $7,500. Then I think they went up to $10K. And then you can do like donor tickets and you get different features and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2399">00:39:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, they're sold out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2401">00:40:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember, it is set up as a nonprofit and there is philanthropic work that's done. And so, you know, the organization is, again, it's not a profiteering media company, it became a big media company, because of the success of the efforts and the quality of the content that was produced over time. But, you know, as we talked about a lot of media companies, and a lot of institutions get captured and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2425">00:40:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, the original kind of mission gets fulfilled.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2439">00:40:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">What other ideas what other talks have been canned before they even got to the stage? You have to wonder and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2458">00:40:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know who are they not inviting?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2480">00:41:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the hypocrisy is just so crazy with the TED people. And it's a lot of my friends still go is they had Sarah Silverman come these people have laughed at Sarah Silverman a million times they've watched Dave Chappelle, they've seen any number of comments, you know, make them laugh with edgy humor. But then when they're in that, you know, TED audience, and they're feeling super precious, and that they're very important because they donate 50 grand a year or whatever Friedberg gave them, I don't know, to get in there from the side door.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2509">00:41:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Then they were super offended. So, you know, they're hypocrites, and I don't know how to say it any more clearly. They literally, you could pull up Chris Anderson apologizing, not just again, again, I really hope this is a learning experience for everyone. I hope that this is a turning point for leadership and institutions like this to take a look at what happened, how it happened. And then hopefully to write the course because organizations like TED, I thought were very important and important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2538">00:42:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We're very important and should be in the world and should be successful. And I hope that they kind of return to the original values. And I hope that this is a moment that that there's a learning experience that we don't just shit on them and say, they're awful, they're failed. It's over. Hopefully something comes to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2551">00:42:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I do think there is one other potential remedy here, which besides just starting a new TED, and kind of the Barry Weiss point of view, which is just write it off and start over. Remember what Brian Armstrong did at Coinbase, he basically just said, Listen, we have a mission here. It's around crypto, we're going to focus 100% on this mission. And if you're not on board with this mission, or want to capture this institution to promote other missions, this is not the place for you. Go do those missions somewhere else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2578">00:42:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And it worked. He took a hit. The New York Times wrote their obligatory hit piece. But a year later, they were told to focus on this mission.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2586">00:43:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say if Chris has good mentors, as well as a good sounding board, that is the threshold question that should be debated right now is do I walk in the door? And do I just give this simple litmus test and have people sign up or not? And yeah, we're kind of it's quite and it's quite easy. Because to your point, it's not like he's inventing something new. He's saying this is where we started. And this is where we're going to stay. And this is what it means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2613">00:43:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And if he doesn't do that, then he's spoken with his actions. And it is what it is. It'll what what is meant to happen exactly then happen. Exactly. And it's a it's a it's a moment for looking at the internal compass. It's a wholesale leadership reset moment opportunity. See if it happens or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2628">00:43:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Or down and keep going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2630">00:43:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I really appreciate your being public about all this and talking about it.

Listen, it's a new segment we have here when virtue signaling goes wrong. If you missed it, the Canadian Parliament gave a standing ovation to a Nazi, not like a new Nazi or a Nazi sympathizer. One of the few actual Nazis still alive. Here we see just the crowd going wild.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2660">00:44:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Last Friday, Ukrainians President Zelensky gave a speech at the Canadian House of Commons and Canadian House Speaker Anthony Rota introduced a 98 year old Yaroslav Hunk as a Ukrainian war hero. And then the Canadian Parliament proceeded to give him a standing ovation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2682">00:44:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And it turns out that this person first fought for the first Ukrainian division in World War Two. That unit was also known as the Waffen SS Galicia Division, if I'm pronouncing that correctly, which was a voluntary unit under Nazi command.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2705">00:45:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So the Canadian Parliament apparently gave a standing ovation to Nazis. They have apologized for this and said it was a mistake. Chamath, I don't know if you got to see this. You're Canadian. So your thoughts on what we've seen here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2719">00:45:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I'll give you my feedback as somebody who, when I was, you know, in Canada, was a pretty ardent liberal. I grew up in a liberal household, my father canvassed religiously for the liberals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2737">00:45:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that at some point after I moved to the United States, they took wokeism, which I think look at some level was rooted in something very important, which was, how do you get marginalized folks to be seen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2754">00:45:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But unfortunately, along the way, just got perverted by folks that just use it as a cudgel to censor people to make other people feel guilty to judge people. And so I think we all would agree that it's kind of become this virus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2770">00:46:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">The thing that it masks are all of these other really bad things that come along with it. And one of them in Canada, which Justin Trudeau is case zero of is also when nepotism goes bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2783">00:46:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">His father was an incredible exemplary Prime Minister in Canada, set the benchmark on all dimensions was just incredible, cool, composed, move the country forward, brought the country together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2797">00:46:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then fast forward 25 or 30 years in a vacuum of leadership, what basically happened, we picked this guy, who was up until that point, a substitute teacher, and the other claim to fame was appearing twice in brownface.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2810">00:46:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so making fun of people like me, and elected him Prime Minister.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2816">00:46:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And what happened was he became the sort of like virtue signal or in chief of this very important ga country.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2826">00:47:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was all kind of bumbling along. And in the absence of anybody else that was able to step up and offer an alternative, he got reelected barely, but he did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2836">00:47:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so many of these things happened in the last year. And when you look through that prism is how you can see what happens if a country doesn't draw a line and finally take a stand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2846">00:47:26.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So we had this guy who was ill qualified and way over his head, who shouldn't have been in this role as Prime Minister get put in that position.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2855">00:47:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, a group of people in Canada push back in this case, the truckers, he and the entire government explicitly labeled them as Nazis, right and said, these people need to be put down and completely dismantled.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2871">00:47:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It didn't seem like it was right. We call that out. We all talked about it. And we said, this doesn't smell right on the surface. These are really seems like good earnest people that are just trying to make a point and are not being heard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2883">00:48:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And we had this thing three weeks ago, two or three weeks ago, where he actually had a speech in front of the entire parliament where he accused the largest democracy in the world, India, in this case, of coming into Canada, Canadian soil and assassinating a Canadian citizen, which is an enormous allegation to levy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2904">00:48:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And what was important to know about that allegation was that it was done without the explicit vocal support of either Britain or the United States, which would be the two most natural allies that Canada would present that information to and instead of doing it behind a closed door to Modi, he did it on live stage, like it was like some theatrical performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2926">00:48:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Then India follows up and says, this guy's kind of known to be a little bit of a drug addict and was on a two day bender and the Indian drug dog smelled a bunch of cocaine on the plane. Then they have this thing from Vladimir Zelensky, where everybody was there to sort of like virtue signal this war, and then they actually invited a Nazi and then gave him a standing ovation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2949">00:49:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you when you put it all together, I think what it shows is just the lack of professionalism, which also belies just the lack of experience and capability. And so I think what it shows is just like, isn't this enough? Like, have we not seen enough of these examples, but you can actually start to ask yourself, why can't we just get really good, competent people to do these jobs?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2973">00:49:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Why can't we actually embrace free speech and all of what it means and explore that? Why can't we have people that don't need to theatrically perform on stage, because eventually, you're going to make these mistakes, and you're going to embarrass your entire country. And then you're going to imperil relations with some really important allies. And I think this is a moment in time where all of those things need to be questioned and put on the table.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2994">00:49:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're clearly questioning his competence here, because to not have the care to check who is going to speak in front of Parliament is crazy. And just to make it super clear, the speaker that invited hunker, that was Anthony rota, resigned on Tuesday. And Trudeau says rota, the person who invited the Nazi is solely responsible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3018">00:50:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he blamed Russian misinformation on top of that. But Jason, you don't you don't the Prime Minister, who is the most important politician in the country doesn't show up someplace unless the office knows who else is going to be there. He knew that Zolensky was going to be there. He would have known who the guest list was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3032">00:50:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, this is really going to cover it up. But, but the bigger issue is just be clear, you're not saying that they invited a Nazi on purpose and cheered for a Nazi on purpose, where nobody's saying that you're saying there's a lack of care here. And it's, it's a lack of competence. It's a lack of competence. Just so we're clear. Yeah. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3051">00:50:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So I agree with all of that. I think there's also two other dimensions to this backstory, if you will. I think first in terms of how does a mistake like this happen? I think it was Orwell who said that he who controls the present controls the past and he who controls the past controls the future. The present is Ukraine, it is the current thing, everybody has to cheer for Ukraine and for the killing of Russians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3077">00:51:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason why Hanka was cheered with a standing ovation is because they said that he fought Russians. He was a war hero who fought Russians. All you had to do was do a little bit of math to realize the guy's 98 years old. When was there a war against Russia? Who could he possibly have been fighting for? But to the extent people did that, they sort of airbrushed it or whitewash history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3098">00:51:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So the present controls the past, to ensure a vision of the future, which Trudeau laid out in this speech he gave recently, where he became so ardent in his support for Ukraine, he was almost yelling at the podium, saying that Canada had to make all these economic sacrifices to win the war. So that's point number one is I think that the woke mind virus almost requires this whitewashing of the past, but it's done for a specific purpose, which is to control the present.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3127">00:52:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is to control the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3128">00:52:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But they're not whitewashing the past if it was a mistake. That intellectually doesn't make sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3132">00:52:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">No, what they did is, what they're saying is...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3135">00:52:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">If I'm understanding you correctly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3136">00:52:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">The present is that we hate Russia so much that we're going to cheer for anybody who killed Russians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3144">00:52:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, I understand your point. But you're agreeing that they did not knowingly put a Nazi on there, so it was a mistake. Got it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3149">00:52:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think they knowingly did it. It was a huge debacle and embarrassing spectacle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3154">00:52:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think that nobody asked any questions about the past because the present overrides it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3159">00:52:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3160">00:52:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">The present need to support the current thing overrides like any sort of examination of what has happened historically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3168">00:52:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">There's one other way in which I think this wasn't an accident, Jason, is that if you look at US policy towards Ukraine, we have made common cause with a number of these far-right, ultra-nationalist groups.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3181">00:53:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Frankly, neo-Nazi groups.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3183">00:53:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And this occurred before the current war.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3186">00:53:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not just a marriage of convenience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3188">00:53:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, if you go back to World War II, the father of Ukrainian nationalism is a guy named Stepan Bandera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3195">00:53:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And today in Ukraine, he is seen as some sort of hero.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3198">00:53:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are streets named after him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3200">00:53:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are streets named after some of his co-conspirators who collaborated with Nazis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3205">00:53:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">If you fast forward to the more recent past, to 2014, when we had this Maidan coup in Kiev that was backed by Victoria Nuland,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3216">00:53:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the key figures in that coup was a guy named Oleg Tanibok, who is the founder of the Svoboda Party, which is the social nationalist party.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3228">00:53:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Which if you know what Nazi stands for, it's national socialist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3232">00:53:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">They basically just flipped the name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3234">00:53:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And the original logo of the Svoboda Party was the Wolf's Angel, which was a Nazi insignia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3240">00:54:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">This was a far-right party infused with the racial ideology of Stepan Bandera, who was, again, a Nazi.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3250">00:54:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And they brought this guy in and his party as the muscle in this coup.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3254">00:54:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look at the Victoria Nuland phone call, the infamous phone call where she is picking the new Ukrainian government, the Yatsyzar guy phone call,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3263">00:54:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">she says that Klitsch, meaning Klitschko, and Tanibok need to remain on the outside, but Yats needs to be talking to Tanibok four times a week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3272">00:54:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.

The Azov battalion is undeniably a neo-Nazi group. It was funded by Igor Kolomoisky, who's a Ukrainian oligarch, who is Jewish, who lives in Israel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3695">01:01:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Why would Kolomoisky do that? Because the Azov battalion believes that every inch of Ukraine, including Crimea and Donbass, which has enormous energy reserves, belongs to Ukraine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3705">01:01:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So it served the business interests of the energy magnates in Ukraine to support these people. And that, look, politics makes for strange bedfellows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3715">01:01:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. That's what I was going to say, actually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3717">01:01:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm not saying that Zelensky or Kolomoisky or anybody else is a Nazi because they aligned with these people. I'm saying they found it politically expedient and useful to align with these groups, just like the US State Department did, quite frankly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3730">01:02:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think we should do that. If you want to go around the world, Jason, saying that we're the champions of freedom and democracy and having this moralistic, almost virtue-signaling foreign policy, I don't think we should be in business or aligned with these neo-Nazi groups, wherever the hell they are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3745">01:02:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's...

There was this Ukrainian hall was bombed here in 1950. So, Canada has a weird history of bringing in some of these people after World War II.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3818">01:03:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I wasn't aware of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3820">01:03:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, exactly. Look, there's no way that any semi-intelligent person who knows the history of World War II, especially the Ukrainian involvement in World War II, wouldn't know that Ukraine was on the German side in World War II. And Hanka volunteered for the SS. He was a volunteer for the SS Galicia Division.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3841">01:04:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, look, did the Speaker of the House know? Probably not. I think wokeness makes people stupid where they just think about the current thing and don't ask too many questions about the past.

All right, there's a bunch of news about OpenAI this week. Just very quickly, OpenAI is in advanced talks, according to the Financial Times, with Johnny Ive of iPhone fame, Steve Jobs' long-term collaborator, and Masi Yoshisan of SoftBank, to raise more than $1 billion to build the iPhone of AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3884">01:04:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, the idea would be Johnny Ive's got a design firm called Love From, and they would help OpenAI design their first consumer device via the FT sources, Financial Times, that is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3898">01:04:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Altman and Ive have been having brainstorming sessions in Ive's San Francisco studio about what a consumer product centered around OpenAI would look like. It's very early stages. And Sun has pitched a role for Arm in the development, his chip company that he recently took public.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3915">01:05:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">They also discussed Masa and Altman creating a company that would draw on talent and tech from their three groups with SoftBank, putting in a billion dollars in seed. And then also OpenAI is discussing a secondary share sale that would value the company at between 80 billion and 90 billion. This would be 3x the most recent valuation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3937">01:05:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Reportedly, though, to their credit, they are on track to generate $1 billion in revenue in 2023. I'm not sure how much of that is the $20 a month subscription. You know, that'd be pretty extraordinary if that was those personal subscriptions. This would be a massive gain on paper for Microsoft.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3952">01:05:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">OpenAI is 49% owned by Microsoft. And Sam Altman has personally has stated multiple times now that he has no equity, so he would be getting $0 of this. And of course, we know that OpenAI started as a non profit before switching. And our friend Vinod Khosla told us very clearly that those are just details. What happened there, Chamath?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3978">01:06:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are just details.

And the reason is because if everything sits on this substrate, you're going to need to get a license, you're going to want to get access to whatever developer program, whatever beta that OpenAI has. And so as a result, he'll be...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4007">01:06:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That's already happened, by the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4008">01:06:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I was just going to say, so he'll be in the catbird seat. So even if he doesn't have any equity in OpenAI, he'll just put his money into the best startups that... it's like Y Combinator on steroids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4019">01:06:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">By the way, I have a take on that whole claim that Sam doesn't own any part of OpenAI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4024">01:07:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, let's hear it. Go ahead, Columbo. Explain to us the details.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4029">01:07:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's one more thing there, ma'am. You said you don't own any shares in OpenAI, but you started OpenAI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4035">01:07:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Right, well, then who does?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4037">01:07:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's the thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4038">01:07:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">What I think is really interesting about what OpenAI has done in its fundraising rounds is that each round has been a capped return model. So...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4047">01:07:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Explain what that is to the audience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4048">01:07:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">100x, 100x, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4050">01:07:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think some of the very early people got capped at 100x. I think maybe the $30 billion round was capped at 10x. So I think the $30 billion round is capped at a $300 million valuation, meaning if you're an investor, your shares go up in value till the company hits a market cap of $300 billion, and then basically you're effectively cashed out. It's like you bought a share, but sold a call back to the company at a $300 billion valuation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4074">01:07:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">The movie industry works this way, right? You invest in a film, they tell you you can make three acts, and then it's over, right? Something like that. I've seen that in the independent film business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4081">01:08:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so in any event, I think people who invested, like the $2 billion valuation were capped at like $100 billion. I heard that employees who were getting stock options are capped at $100 billion, or they were way back when they started granting these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4093">01:08:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4094">01:08:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So my point is that if open AI turns into one of these companies, like a Google ends up in the trillion dollar club, then nobody's gonna own anything because they will have already long ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4107">01:08:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I think what's really going on here is somebody has to own the residual value of the company call it the far out of the money call around the IRS problem of it being non equity. That's how they say that it's not equity in a private corporation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4136">01:08:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, but I think I think what's so brilliant about it is okay, so look, Sam set up this foundation. It's a nonprofit. But he controls that effectively, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4145">01:09:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4146">01:09:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So yes, he technically is not an owner of the shares the foundation is. But what can't you do with the foundation that you could do with personal ownership other than maybe buying a personal residence? I mean, you can buy a plane, I think, look at the Church of Scientology, they own a lot of real estate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4162">01:09:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So my point is, not only do I think that Sam really owns open AI through the fig leaf, this foundation, I think he owns 100% of it in the event that the call option is struck, meaning it ends up being a trillion dollar company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4176">01:09:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Are you saying Sam is our Ron Hubbard in this example?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4180">01:09:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's not speculate too much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4182">01:09:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, it's just details. Right. As we know, it said, details.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4186">01:09:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I am speculating, but I think it's informed speculation. If you wanted to become the world's first trillionaire, and you were extremely premeditated about it, clever and premeditated about it, what would you do? Number one, you would want to choose a moonshot type area that was a world changing technology. AI certainly qualifies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4205">01:10:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure, ultimate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4206">01:10:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's called fusion. Maybe crypto does, as I understand the same as bets in all three of those areas. Number two, you would want to figure out a way to own as much of it as you could really 100% if you could. And that's a very hard thing to do when you're running a capital intensive startup. But investors tend to underestimate the power law, and the value of the far out of the money call option. So maybe you can get them to sell that back to you really cheaply.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4233">01:10:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And third, if you're really farsighted, you would want to insulate yourself against populist anger from being the world's first trillionaire. So you would basically put your shares in a nonprofit foundation where you're not really sacrificing that much of control, or the ability to control the asset, but it gives you tremendous defense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4254">01:10:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Where did you come up with this? Is this? This is genius. This is genius. It just you and Peter Thiel talk about this over chess or something. How did you construct this? And you're saying this is in for a lot of financial conspiracy corner. I think this is science corner. Let's get the tinfoil hats out. It's really freaking Friedberg out that we're even doing this diametrically opposite to science corner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4275">01:11:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it a conspiracy? Or is it just reality?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4277">01:11:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I think if you are even 1%, right, the combination of lawyers and accountants that would leak this and the number of people that were part of the origination of the foundation that would want to sue will be very high. That's just the natural state of things in these kinds of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4296">01:11:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">There seems like a lot easier way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4298">01:11:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But what have I said other than the fact that it was sort of premeditated, which that's not the right word that premeditated sounds too nefarious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4305">01:11:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">No, no, no, I'm just saying whenever, whenever, I'm just saying whenever money is made at this quantum and at that scale, everybody wants a piece because they know that that's their one shot. So I just think that it'll amplify the pressure for actors inside of those organizations to take their shot. And that's just going to be financially the right thing to do for a lot of people if if what you're saying is true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4331">01:12:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We know the investments have been made under a capital return model. I think that's fact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4335">01:12:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That's fact.

Because he was the one that really got this thing off the ground, because that critical investment made the whole thing come to life. He could have done this on his own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4350">01:12:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, how much does he own?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4352">01:12:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Zero.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4353">01:12:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Zero.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4354">01:12:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, but after a lawsuit, how much does he own? I don't know. I'm just speculating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4360">01:12:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Can we talk about the technology?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4362">01:12:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Here we go. So opening I released some new chat GPT features. The key point here is they're doing what's called multi modal. Multi modal is the big innovation. What does that mean? That means the input could be voice, the input could be code, the input could be data. It could be a picture. Here's a picture. If you're watching along on the YouTube channel, do a search for all in podcast on YouTube, hit subscribe, hit the bell. And it's a classic picture of one of those no parking signs where there's four different ones, you take a picture of that, that's the input.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4389">01:13:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And you say it's Wednesday at 4pm. Can I park in the spot right now? Tell me in one line, it comes back and says yes, you can park for up to one hour starting at 4pm. What this means is the output or the input could be in any of those modalities, modalities, fancy word for an image, a video, etc. So you're going to be able to say, hey, give me the poster for the all in conference of bestie runner. And I want it to be the things and here are the pictures of the boys and then make it and go back and forth and back and forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4416">01:13:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is really groundbreaking. At the same time, last week, Google Bard and Sandeep Madhra and I played with this on this week in startups. You now have Google Flights, Google Docs, Gmail, and a number of the other core Google services are now in Bard. So that's not multi modal exactly. But you could do things like ask Google Flights, hey, what is the best nonstop? You know, between New York City and New York City?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4445">01:14:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And Dubai, or from an East Coast destination that has laid down flat seats, etc. And it really does. It's starting to work. So this idea that Google is going to be displaced, or they're moving slow, that might be antiquated information. So those are the two big, big monumental announcements just in the last 10 days. Freeberg, when you look at these two, which one is the more important announcement? And what do you think about the pace? Because we here we are, we're about to hit the one year anniversary of Chad GPT 3.5.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4474">01:14:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been using a lot of different tools the last couple of months. And I'm kind of getting to the point that I feel that much of what's happening is under hyped rather than overhyped. There's some really incredible potential emerging. I'll give a couple of examples. And then I'll talk about the mobile phone. First is Andre Carpati, as you guys see in the tweet that I just posted in the chat, made a point today, that LLMs are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4504">01:15:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">emerging not just as a chatbot, but as a kernel process, meaning a new type of operating system that can do input and output across different modalities can interpret code can access the internet and information and then can render things in a visual way, or in an audio way that the user wants to consume it. So as a result, LLMs become the core driver to a new type of computing interface. There was a paper published and I'll share the link to this paper here as well. And we can put it in the notes, it's not worth pulling up on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4532">01:15:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">screen, that showed that using LLMs in autonomous driving can actually significantly improve the performance of the neural nets that the autonomous cars are trained on. So the autonomous car is typically trained on a bunch of sensor data that comes in. And then that sensor data determines what sort of action to take with the car. And what this team showed is that if you actually put in a communication layer that thinks and talks like a human in between the sensor data and the action data, it can actually improve the performance of the autonomous car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4557">01:15:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that thinks and talks like a human in between the sensor data and the action data, it can do really wide ranging interpretations of the data that otherwise would not be apparent from the data set it was trained on. So for example, you can see a person down the road and ask it, what do you think that person is going to do next? And the LLM because it's trained on a much larger corpus of data than just sensor data from cars, it can make a really good human like interpretation of that feedback decision back into the control system of the car and have the car do the action that it's trained on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4582">01:16:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of that feedback decision back into the control system of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4585">01:16:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">car, and have the car do something more intelligently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4588">01:16:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">than it otherwise would have been able to do. So these LLM are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4591">01:16:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">becoming a lot more like a software operating system.
