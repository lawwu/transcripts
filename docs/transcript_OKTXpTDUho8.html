And one of the most important habits I built last year was waking up early. I've never really been a morning person. I've always been a little bit more of a stay up late and get stuff done. And I was able to create this uninterrupted time in my schedule, anywhere from one to two hours, depending on when I woke up, when the kids woke up.</p><p>And I've used that time for exercise, for work, for cold plunges and a lot more. And it feels easy now. And the trick for me was that it wasn't about when I woke up. It was about when I went to bed. And so I made my habit at night.</p><p>So start small, focus on keystone habits because they create a ripple effect in your life. And let's try to commit all of us to building some better habits in the year ahead.</p></div></div></body></html>
