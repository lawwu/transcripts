And on an optimistic note, he said, I think it's likely to succeed. Interestingly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hscUFWaBvw&t=558">00:09:18.940</a></span> | <span class="t">his job now seems to be to align the AI that they're going to use to automate the alignment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hscUFWaBvw&t=564">00:09:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">of a super intelligent AI.
