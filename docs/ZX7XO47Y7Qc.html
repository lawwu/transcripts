I think that there is an absolute use for looking at points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">and miles as how do we use these to essentially get free or as close to free travel as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's an amazing use of points and miles. So I'm not necessarily looking at how can points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and miles keep my travel costs as low as possible. What I'm looking at is how can I take this travel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">budget that I've allocated? How can I expand it at exponentially using points? And when that's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">actual question then I think that automatically informs kind of everything that comes downstream of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So some of the I think mainstream advice about how to earn points while I think that it's useful and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">valid depending on what your background is it's not applicable necessarily anymore for me. So I'll just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">give you one example. When I was learning about points and miles I felt like a lot of the information out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">there was essentially always be working on a new welcome bonus offer. Allocate all of your expenses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to a brand new credit card and then just rinse and repeat. And again I think that there are scenarios where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that makes amazing sense. And there are scenarios where it doesn't, you know, fast forward a couple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">years. My husband is self-employed. I am now self-employed. We have businesses that have expenses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Our expenses are now at the level where it is not practical for us to have an approach where all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.980</a></span> | <span class="t">our expenses should automatically go on a brand new card in order to earn a sub. The number of cards that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">we would have to be applying for on any given day makes me even as a points enthusiast start to sweat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It is just not possible. And so I think there are areas where a lot of traditional points and miles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.020</a></span> | <span class="t">advice and education are phenomenal. And then depending on what your background is, your context is that may</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">not hold true anymore.

And it's only because I have run the math and it makes sense given my kind of specific scenario</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">is that there's no one right way to do points or miles. There's no one right way to earn them or to use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.380</a></span> | <span class="t">them. And once you have kind of a foundational amount of knowledge and experience, then you can start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.860</a></span> | <span class="t">getting really critical and curious about, okay, but what about me, right? What about the way I want to earn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.060</a></span> | <span class="t">points and use points or what about my specific situation might actually call for a deviation from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">what is actually really conventional and sometimes amazing education and advice out there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">This reminds me of an email I got and I shared it with you where someone said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Chris, you give so much information, but it's really hard, at least on the point side for me to put it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">use. I feel like I've unlocked this magic. But now when I think about trying to maximize it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.180</a></span> | <span class="t">you've taught me the scope of everything that can be done. And now I'm convinced I'm just going to screw it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">up and I'm almost paralyzed. And I feel like the reason that I first thought I had to invite you on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You've got a way of thinking about this that I think would be really helpful to people, not just at that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.900</a></span> | <span class="t">stage, but throughout the journey that would make it a little easier to think about how to get out of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.740</a></span> | <span class="t">some of that paralysis, how to feel better about learning a lot. I know as a podcast host, I like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.500</a></span> | <span class="t">dumping lots of information. I don't want that to be too overwhelming. So I thought we could walk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.840</a></span> | <span class="t">through that framework you have and then talk about a bunch of tactics that people can fit into it at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">different stages. Let me talk about what is this framework? Some people may be familiar with it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">people might want to Google it. So there's this one very specific graphic. It's a curve. It's called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">the Dunning-Kruger curve. So we can link to that in the episode show notes. You can, like I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">pull this up on Google. And kind of where this comes from is that they wanted to see was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, how do people experience kind of themselves based on how much knowledge or skill they have in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">specific area. So they ran these participants through, you know, the study, all of these tests</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to assess competency in certain areas. And then they also surveyed the participants and actually asked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">them, okay, how well do you think you did? And a lot of us, when we know nothing about something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we're like, yeah, I don't feel very good about that. And once we know a lot about it, we feel very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.900</a></span> | <span class="t">confident. But what was really interesting that Dunning and Kruger found is that this very kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">of first stage of learning their first stage of competence in something, where you're actually very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">bad at something, or your level of knowledge in it is very, very small, a lot of us tend to have a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of confidence at this time. Now they have a term for this kind of phase of learning or this phase of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">competence.

But what do you do when especially you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">notice that you're in this phase of feeling like there's too much to learn, or you don't have enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">time?

It's just that my confidence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">has gone down actually no more than I did a month ago, a year ago, 10 years ago. It helps to reframe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and remind you, wait a minute, no, I am actually getting better at this in terms of my knowledge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">base. And what follows knowledge is skill. So as long as you keep learning, you keep practicing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you keep trying, your skill is going to catch up with that knowledge. And so in the beginning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it really is just reminding yourself, no, no, no, no, no, it doesn't feel easy right now. But there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.580</a></span> | <span class="t">is value in continuing to work on this. Because what happens next is that as you continue to gain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge or skill or competence, you know, in this specific area, your confidence actually does start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">going back up. So it doesn't shoot straight up the way that we initially see kind of at the beginning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">zone of learning. But now it starts a really strong and steady climb upwards. And this correlates with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">a transition between becoming what's called consciously incompetent.

One, teaching kids how to ski is much easier on skis. And let's put aside the fact that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">probably could have taught them how to snowboard, but let's just shelve that. And we were using these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">harnesses and it's just so hard to do on a snowboard. And I thought, well, why don't I just ski?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, we're not going down these difficult runs. We're going down the easiest runs on the mountain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">What if I rent some skis and we go and experience this? And thankfully, we were in Steamboat Springs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Colorado.

So I rented some skis. Now, I wouldn't advise anyone learning to ski for the first time to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">try and also take their toddler on the chairlift. But first time off the chairlift, both of us fell,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">slid down. And I was like, I went into this thinking, how hard could this be? Well, first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of all, I never even thought about skiing. It didn't even cross my mind. I was totally fine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that I didn't know how to ski. And we went for two or three days and it was just brutal the first day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And at one point I was like, maybe now I'm good enough to help my daughter. And all of a sudden,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">she's going down and I can't control her and I'm falling over. And it's like, I went from a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">competent snowboarder to an absolute clown. I wanted to video some of the kids, but I was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I have to focus so hard on skiing that I can't even make a video. Whereas on a snowboard,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it would be just be completely unconscious. It was just so easy to do. And so I just stuck at it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And to make everything worse, my kids are progressing incredibly fast. My nephews are like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">pros jumping off the sides of the mountain. And over two days though, I could feel the confidence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think unfortunately, something like skiing, it's very easy after 10 runs to be like, wow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I came down this mountain better than I did before.

And I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">know why, but it just made me think, why is it so much harder for someone learning a skill that's online,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that is less physical to be comfortable not trying the really hard thing out the gates.

And I think that that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1485" target="_blank">00:24:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">entirely untrue.

I was looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1521" target="_blank">00:25:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">for a flight.

I had a conversation with my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">wife the other day.

I think if that is the scenario,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1637" target="_blank">00:27:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that's most high yield for you, I think that makes so much sense. I very rarely open new cards now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1642" target="_blank">00:27:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And part of it is, I've been doing this for a long time. So I have all of the cards I consider to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1646" target="_blank">00:27:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">actually, actual foundational points earning cards that I want to use on a regular basis,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1651" target="_blank">00:27:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but also because it no longer makes sense for me to constantly be trying to open cards. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1657" target="_blank">00:27:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the first step is really looking at, again, what, where am I going to get kind of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1662" target="_blank">00:27:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">no pun intended, the biggest bang for my buck. And so for me right now, it's things like having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1668" target="_blank">00:27:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">credit cards that give me really, really great bonus points earning for my everyday suspense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1673" target="_blank">00:27:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">spend when I'm not actually working on a welcome bonus. And so I have personal cards, I have business</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1680" target="_blank">00:28:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">cards. And part of that too, is also looking at what are the points currencies when you are ready to kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1685" target="_blank">00:28:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of expand beyond one type of points currency. If you feel like you're in the phase where you're ready to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1690" target="_blank">00:28:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">get into a second or a third points currency, at any given time, what is the highest yield points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1695" target="_blank">00:28:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">currency that I'm trying to earn? Because I think people can get very, very kind of confused or in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1701" target="_blank">00:28:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the weeds when they do start to have more credit cards and saying, wow, I've got five different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1705" target="_blank">00:28:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">options of cards that I could use for this one particular expense. How do I prioritize it? Should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1709" target="_blank">00:28:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I prioritize that just card a gives me more points than any other card? And I think that's one way to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1715" target="_blank">00:28:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think it's also really valid to ask, huh, for what I want to do with my points right now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1720" target="_blank">00:28:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what's going to be the highest yield for me? So being really comfortable, not always doing again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1726" target="_blank">00:28:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever you think everybody else is doing with their cards, but being really clear on what are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1731" target="_blank">00:28:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you trying to accomplish? And then what are the tools you have available to you that's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1734" target="_blank">00:28:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">help you accomplish that? Yeah, I think about this a lot of times. And you know, I recently opened up a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1740" target="_blank">00:29:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">city card. And I have a little bit of a struggle here, because I just wanted to get into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1745" target="_blank">00:29:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">city ecosystem. I hadn't been able to talk about it on the podcast. So I probably have a business</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1749" target="_blank">00:29:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">reason to go. But now I'm like, oh, this card might be better for this purchase. But I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1754" target="_blank">00:29:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">have enough city points to really do anything. Versus if I put them somewhere else, they can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1758" target="_blank">00:29:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">contribute towards a trip. Now, I think that's just an example of there might be some card that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">earns an obscure amount of points that's higher than other things. But if you don't spend enough in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1769" target="_blank">00:29:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that category for that total number of points accumulated to be meaningful, or if you're going to earn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1775" target="_blank">00:29:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">some obscure number of Wyndham points on gas, but you don't even need Wyndham, or your total</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1781" target="_blank">00:29:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">gas spend is small enough that it's not enough to even book a vacation, think about whether that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1786" target="_blank">00:29:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">matters. So I like that approach. And let's get really tactical with a few things. You mentioned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1793" target="_blank">00:29:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">earlier, paying a fee towards using your credit card. Let's talk about that and break that down,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1800" target="_blank">00:30:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">because I get a lot of questions about that. Especially right now. It's around tax time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1805" target="_blank">00:30:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But but I don't know if this will come out before the 15th. So broader than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1809" target="_blank">00:30:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">What what how do you think about that decision?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1812" target="_blank">00:30:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I love thinking about this so much. And again, as I will probably preface everything I say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1818" target="_blank">00:30:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it's that you always want to hear whatever it is that someone offers, and then put it on yourself and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1823" target="_blank">00:30:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">say, Okay, does this actually apply to me? Is this useful for me? Because the answer may be no.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1827" target="_blank">00:30:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I think about certain expenses, in my life, the expenses that I think offer oftentimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1836" target="_blank">00:30:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">really, really amazing points earning opportunities, because they tend to be high, usually one time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1841" target="_blank">00:30:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">or only a few times a year expenses are ones that don't take a credit card directly without my having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1848" target="_blank">00:30:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to pay a processing fee. So in my life, this looks like things like tax payments, my husband and I are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1852" target="_blank">00:30:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">both self employed, we have the lovely advantage of having quarterly tax payments. So we're paying taxes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, every couple of months. And when we look at the things we spend money on over the year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1861" target="_blank">00:31:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">our tax payments are probably our single highest expense category compared to something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1866" target="_blank">00:31:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">dining out, you know, or compared to something like even online shopping. And so one of the things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1872" target="_blank">00:31:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think is helpful is to first look at, in your life, do you have expenses, where you could pay them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1877" target="_blank">00:31:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">with a credit card, but they would incur a processing fee in order to do so, and get a very good sense of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1883" target="_blank">00:31:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, but what impact would that make on your overall points earning landscape, if you could earn points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1888" target="_blank">00:31:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">for that, right? Is that 1% of your overall annual spend? Or is this a significant amount of your annual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1894" target="_blank">00:31:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">spend? Because for folks who have a significant amount of annual spend, whether it's personal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1898" target="_blank">00:31:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or business spend, or both, where they could pay with a credit card, but would have to pay a processing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1903" target="_blank">00:31:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">fee. I think that's the first question that needs to be answered. Like, what is the impact of this going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1907" target="_blank">00:31:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to be right? I love to optimize points, but I am not a maximizer, I will not chase every single points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1913" target="_blank">00:31:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">earning opportunity, it has to be high yield. And so first, you want to get a general idea of what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1918" target="_blank">00:31:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the scope of the yield of this activity going to be. So other things that I know folks can pay using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1923" target="_blank">00:32:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a credit card, but also get charged a processing fee that could potentially be very high yield</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1927" target="_blank">00:32:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">points earning opportunities for them. Many, many people, if you have children, and they're in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1931" target="_blank">00:32:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">daycare, perhaps they go to a school that has a tuition, maybe there is some sort of activity that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1937" target="_blank">00:32:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a child is involved in. In my area, there's a lot of summer camps that people could theoretically send</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1942" target="_blank">00:32:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">their children to the camps charge a processing fee in order for you to enroll your kids in them using a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1948" target="_blank">00:32:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">credit card. You know, we can talk about other opportunities, too. There are a lot of vendors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1952" target="_blank">00:32:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">or services that may not accept a credit card outright. And so you may be looking into a payment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1958" target="_blank">00:32:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">platform, something like plastique, or milio or zill money that basically allows you to pay a specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1965" target="_blank">00:32:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">service or vendor. And then you have to pay them, you know, processing fee, so that you have the luxury</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1971" target="_blank">00:32:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of using your credit card. So one of the first things that I always want to look at is for any given single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1977" target="_blank">00:32:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">big expense. And we'll take the tax payments as an example. But again, this could be daycare,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1981" target="_blank">00:33:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it could be tuition, could be you're doing a home renovation, and your contractor does not accept</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1986" target="_blank">00:33:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">your American Express business platinum card, and you want to earn the sub. So you want to go through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1990" target="_blank">00:33:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">one of these payment processing platforms. The first thing I always look at is what is the actual amount</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=1995" target="_blank">00:33:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of this expense itself, you always, always want to know what is the exact processing fee that you are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2000" target="_blank">00:33:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be charged if you do want to pay by credit card, because this can vary, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2005" target="_blank">00:33:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes it can be something like 1.7% or 1.8%. Depending on the service or vendor that you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2012" target="_blank">00:33:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">using, it can be much higher, it can be 2.9% or over 3%. But you have to know what that processing fee</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2017" target="_blank">00:33:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is, because you are going to pay that percentage of your total bill amount, in addition to your total</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2024" target="_blank">00:33:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">bill amount. So let's just pretend you know, you have a $10,000 bill that you want to pay. And the processing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2030" target="_blank">00:33:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">fee that you would have to pay in order to use your credit card is 2%. Right? So you're not just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2036" target="_blank">00:33:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">paying your $10,000 bill, you're paying $10,000 plus the 2% processing fee. So once you know that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2042" target="_blank">00:34:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, the total amount of points that you would theoretically earn for this expense.

None of us wants to just spend money that we don't have to spend. So the question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2061" target="_blank">00:34:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is always going to be the number of points that I earn by using my credit card for this expense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2066" target="_blank">00:34:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Am I going to get significantly more value out of these points out of the way I use them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2071" target="_blank">00:34:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">then the cash cost of that processing fee.

What is the actual cash cost of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2118" target="_blank">00:35:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that processing fee?

And so I think for everybody, one of the things that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2219" target="_blank">00:36:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">think is really important, the more you get into this hobby is to realize that there's probably some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2224" target="_blank">00:37:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">foundational kind of basic teaching and guidance on everything in points and miles. I think it's great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2230" target="_blank">00:37:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to learn that first. And then you can start looking at the nuances, then you can start looking at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2236" target="_blank">00:37:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">exceptions. So I never tell people, you should always pay a processing fee in order to use your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2241" target="_blank">00:37:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">points just because a lot of times I do.

Because I don't actually think that's true either. I think what makes a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2251" target="_blank">00:37:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">sense is start with what is kind of the safest, most conservative approach you can take. And then when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2258" target="_blank">00:37:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of understand the basics of this, and you can understand how to evaluate it for your own personal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2263" target="_blank">00:37:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">scenario, then you can start looking for those exceptions. And so it starts with math, but it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2268" target="_blank">00:37:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">also comes back to what are your goals? And what is your comfort level in earning and using points?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2273" target="_blank">00:37:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I love that. There's two things. One, to the extent that this is a question related to a business,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2279" target="_blank">00:37:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it is often that that processing fee could be treated as a business expense. So keep that in mind for any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2285" target="_blank">00:38:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">business owners. But two, since I'm guessing you've done this a few times, are any of the more common,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2291" target="_blank">00:38:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you mentioned plastic, milio, do any of those transactions actually code as anything interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2297" target="_blank">00:38:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that earns multiples? Yeah. And that's why I think this is so valuable to know. And also take this with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2302" target="_blank">00:38:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like a huge boulder of salt. Because if you've been in the points and miles world, you're probably aware</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2307" target="_blank">00:38:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that this is a very dynamic landscape, things can and do change overnight. So one thing I always,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2313" target="_blank">00:38:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">always, always tell people is, if you hear something that I'm about to say, if you hear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2317" target="_blank">00:38:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">something on another, you know, platform, please do your due diligence and double check because these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2322" target="_blank">00:38:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">are the types of things that can change overnight. So as of the time that we're recording this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2327" target="_blank">00:38:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I have been told I have not tried this personally, but I run a Facebook group of about 28,000 people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2332" target="_blank">00:38:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have some good data points in there that Plastique, which is one of these online payment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2337" target="_blank">00:38:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">platforms that it can code when you use specifically the chasing business preferred card. This is one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2343" target="_blank">00:39:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">several chasing business cards that chase offers. The chasing business preferred card has shipping as one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2349" target="_blank">00:39:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of its bonus categories, you can earn three times points on it, up to about I think $150,000 spent over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2355" target="_blank">00:39:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a calendar year. So again, for business owners, this can be a really great option for a card to have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2361" target="_blank">00:39:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I have been told that Plastique can code as shipping, even when the vendor the service that you are trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2366" target="_blank">00:39:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to pay is not FedEx or is not UPS. And so that can be a very interesting way to leverage your shipping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2373" target="_blank">00:39:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">bonus category on chase. Now, the third platform that I mentioned is called Zill monies, Z I L money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2380" target="_blank">00:39:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">This is specifically for business owners. It's a really fascinating payment platform. It is probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2386" target="_blank">00:39:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the most dynamic one. And I mean, changes all the time. So by the time we even finished recording this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2391" target="_blank">00:39:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">conversation, this may be different. For a little while, Zill money was coding also is shipping, meaning that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2398" target="_blank">00:39:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that you could earn 3x using your chase Inc business preferred card. And Zill money is a fascinating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2403" target="_blank">00:40:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">platform because not only does it allow businesses to pay services or vendors for their business,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2407" target="_blank">00:40:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you can pay payroll for your business through Zill money, you can pay commercial rent for your business</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2413" target="_blank">00:40:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">through Zill money. So some of these expenses that some business owners may be encountering that right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2418" target="_blank">00:40:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">now we don't have a lot of other avenues to easily earn points like we love built right for residential</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2424" target="_blank">00:40:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">rent.

And so it is always really fascinating to find out about some of these avenues for points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2434" target="_blank">00:40:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">earning.

In a way, you could argue that you're kind of buying points. And so if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2606" target="_blank">00:43:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you figure out the rate at which you're buying, you can figure out whether the rate at which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2610" target="_blank">00:43:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you're earning them makes sense.

So I'm wondering if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2627" target="_blank">00:43:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you are a few years ahead of me in that process, how do people looking for three, four, or more seats</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2634" target="_blank">00:43:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">start to better be able to take advantage of award travel, especially if they're looking for premium cabins?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2640" target="_blank">00:44:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely. And I was actually going to couch this entire answer, like with that caveat specifically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2645" target="_blank">00:44:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I think if your priority is to find economy seats for domestic or international flights,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2649" target="_blank">00:44:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you are going to have an easier time than if your preference is to find international premium cabins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2655" target="_blank">00:44:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm not even going to talk about first class because oftentimes you are not reliably easily going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2660" target="_blank">00:44:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to be able to find more than one first class award seat on many international airlines, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2664" target="_blank">00:44:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">business class is possible. It's definitely not as easy as if you are a solo traveler or traveling with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2670" target="_blank">00:44:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">two people, but it is definitely possible. So I will kind of tell you what my approach has been,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2676" target="_blank">00:44:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">which again, sometimes it works and sometimes it's a little bit less reliable, but it's a really good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2680" target="_blank">00:44:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">starting point. So first things first, you know, we talk a lot in award travel about when it comes to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2685" target="_blank">00:44:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">getting potentially as much value as you can from your points, using them to transfer them out of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2691" target="_blank">00:44:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">transferable points currencies and into specifically airline transfer partner accounts for flights,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2696" target="_blank">00:44:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that there is so much importance that we place on flexibility, right? That you need to be aware of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2702" target="_blank">00:45:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of what are your zones of flexibility, because you might be able to get a lot of what you want, but you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2707" target="_blank">00:45:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">probably are not going to be able to get everything you want. And what I mean by that is, if you're looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2711" target="_blank">00:45:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">for multiple premium cabin international flights, you may not be able to say I want to fly on these specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2716" target="_blank">00:45:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">days, these specific Saturdays, right around my kids spring break, or my kids winter break, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2721" target="_blank">00:45:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you may not be able to say, Hey, I want to fly from my local airport all the way to my destination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2726" target="_blank">00:45:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not willing to look at any other departure airport, especially if your local airport happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2731" target="_blank">00:45:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to be more local or more regional.

So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2744" target="_blank">00:45:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">first thing is actually not strategy in terms of go to this airline or do this thing. It's I always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2749" target="_blank">00:45:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">really recommend to people know where you can be flexible and know where you can't be. You don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2753" target="_blank">00:45:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">have to be infinitely flexible, but you do have to be aware of where are you willing to bend if it's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2758" target="_blank">00:45:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">difference between finding a good flight option and no flight option. And for me, what that looks like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2764" target="_blank">00:46:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is I'm lucky. My local airport is a huge international airport. So I naturally have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2769" target="_blank">00:46:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of options for international flights, but I have a family of four. And when we travel with our kids,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2774" target="_blank">00:46:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we do try to travel around their spring break, their winter break, when many other people are traveling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2779" target="_blank">00:46:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and probably want to go to similar places that we want to go. And so inventory may not be very high.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2784" target="_blank">00:46:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so first of all, along with flexibility is I tell people, if you can, I get it. Maybe it's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2790" target="_blank">00:46:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">milestone trip, or maybe you just don't want to be flexible about your destination and you want to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2795" target="_blank">00:46:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to one specific place. I can understand that. But if you do not have your heart set on one specific place,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2800" target="_blank">00:46:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">then allow yourself to follow where some of the best opportunities are instead of saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2806" target="_blank">00:46:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I know I specifically only want to go to destination a for this trip, because award</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2811" target="_blank">00:46:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">availability can and will fluctuate. There can be times there's no award availability,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2815" target="_blank">00:46:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">let's say to Japan that has been so insanely popular recently. But you can actually find award</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2820" target="_blank">00:47:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">availability to somewhere else that you would also love to go. And then let's talk about actual tips,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2826" target="_blank">00:47:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">actual strategies, where to look. I think there are certain airlines that reliably have more business</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2832" target="_blank">00:47:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">class, especially award space than other airlines. And so I think it's best start where you have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2837" target="_blank">00:47:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">highest chances of success. That used to be Air France flying blue, especially for flights between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2842" target="_blank">00:47:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">North America and Europe. They used to have amazing award availability for multiple people in business</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2847" target="_blank">00:47:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">class. One discouraging trend this year is that that has not been the case recently. And so now I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2853" target="_blank">00:47:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">telling people, okay, don't depend on Air France flying blue to get your family to Europe. But there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2858" target="_blank">00:47:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">other airlines that do still reliably have multiple business class awards that are available. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2863" target="_blank">00:47:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe just the fact that these are available will help determine where you're willing to go. So one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2868" target="_blank">00:47:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">airline that tends to have really, really good award availability on specific routes is Emirates. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2873" target="_blank">00:47:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Emirates is an amazing airline is based in Dubai. Maybe you never thought about going to Dubai. It's an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2878" target="_blank">00:47:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">incredible city. But specifically on flights that Emirates operates that don't start or end in Dubai,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2885" target="_blank">00:48:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">there is amazing award availability. So these are known as fifth freedom flights, they actually operate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2890" target="_blank">00:48:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I think three, they operate four from North America. A lot of people are familiar with the routes that fly out of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2896" target="_blank">00:48:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the New York area. So Emirates operates a flight from JFK specifically to Milan. They also operate a flight from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX7XO47Y7Qc&t=2903" target="_blank">00:48:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Newark to Athens. So people are familiar with that, that can have amazing award availability over to Europe.
