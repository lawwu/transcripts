Elevate your holiday wine time with WineEnthusiast.com. WineEnthusiast has everything you need to transform your entertaining space into the ultimate wine spectacle of the season. From wine storage to glassware, personalized accessories, furniture, and more. Uncork a little joy this year with WineEnthusiast. Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while building a plan for financial freedom in ten years or less.</p><p>My name is Joshua Sheets and I am your host. Today I want to talk with you more about your income and give you some ideal targets for the type of income that you should target. I am embarrassed to hear about very capable people who aim low on their income.</p><p>I understand it intellectually and emotionally. I especially understand it if you're working in a career you don't like or you're in a job you don't like. I've been there, done that. And I get that. And so there's a tendency to focus in and say, "Well, how can I lower my expenses as much as possible?" But over the years of Radical Personal Finance, I've done a series of shows trying to confront this problem, especially for young men, to say, "You should have ambition to increase your income." I tell you again, you should have ambition to increase your income.</p><p>If you don't have ambition to increase your income, why not? There are a few mental problems that cause people not to have ambition to increase their income. Sometimes, people say, "Well, if I'm earning a lot of money, then I'm going to hurt other people." Well, if you're earning a lot of money by killing or raping or murdering or looting other people, because killing and murdering are the same thing, but you get the point, yes, that's kind of a problem.</p><p>We don't want to do that. But if you're earning a lot of money by serving more people, that service is good. The people who serve me in my life and serve me well deserve to do well. I want the people that serve me to do well. I want the servant who provides food for me in a restaurant to earn a lot of money.</p><p>I want that chef to earn a lot of money for that great dish that they created. I want that server who brought the food to my table and kept my water glass full. I want them to do well. I want everybody who serves me to prosper. I want my servant who cuts my grass to prosper.</p><p>I want my servant who cleans my teeth to prosper. I want my servant who cracks my back to prosper. Because the more they prosper, the better service they'll give to me. You want me to prosper. Because the more I prosper, the better service I can provide to you. I'm very gratified.</p><p>So many listeners have written to me over the years and said, "Joshua, we want to make sure you're still around in 10 years. We like what you're doing." Well, guess what? If I don't make a lot of money doing what I'm doing here for you on Radical Personal Finance, I ain't going to do it.</p><p>Or at least I ain't going to do it the way that I'm doing it now. I made a lot of money as a financial planner. That path is easy. Rich people love to pay other servants to help them make more money. I would be very satisfied to go back to that business.</p><p>Now I have a mission that goes beyond just simply working with one particular family, but I'll tell you what. I keep my tentacles connected. I keep my options open. I haven't burned all my bridges. I've burned a lot of them, but I haven't burned them all. Why? Because I want to prosper.</p><p>I want to get rich, and I'm going to get rich through service. Now my personal plan, in case you're curious, my personal plan is to get rich by serving lots and lots of people, but I can also get rich by what I would do now if I were to go back in the financial planning industry.</p><p>I would go and work for a single family or a small multifamily office, and I would get rich by serving one rich family. That's what I would do. It would fit me. So you should have an ambition to increase your income. It'll be good for you. It'll be good for the people that you serve.</p><p>It'll be good for the people that you love. But very rarely do people sit down and figure out, "Well, how much income do I need to make to live the good life?" Very rarely do people sit down and actually set a target. So I want to give you some goals today.</p><p>I don't love to do this, but I've changed my mind. I used to say, "What are your goals? What are your goals? I'll just listen. I'll just listen. What are your goals? You tell me about them." But I've learned that a lot of people don't have goals, and it's useful to have goals.</p><p>I've learned that a lot of people, especially young men, just kind of wander from one thing to another. Years ago, I worked with a young man who was thinking about getting married. He was not earning much money. I think at the time he was working as a valet. I sat down with him and I said, "Let's make a budget, and let's figure out how much money you need to earn to be able to support a family." Well that process opened his eyes.</p><p>I want to talk to you about some different levels of income by talking with you about some different lifestyles that are available to you. Let's start with a minimum wage income. Now one of my favorite shows that I have ever done on Radical Personal Finance, and one of the more popular ones, is a show that I did called "How I Would Become a Millionaire Working a Minimum Wage Job at Walmart." If you haven't listened to it, you are underprivileged.</p><p>I would recommend you go back and listen to episode 43 from August 15, 2014. August 15, 2014, I published that show. Number 43 is called "My Plan for How I Would Become a Millionaire with a Minimum Wage Job at Walmart." Very popular. I'm really proud of it. I think it was still a good show.</p><p>But the very thing that I led with was saying the first thing I would do is not work a minimum wage job at Walmart, because the way you get rich is not by earning a minimum wage. But I showed how you could build wealth on a minimum wage job at Walmart if you were very careful.</p><p>So let's break down that income. In the United States of America, the federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. Some states have higher minimum wages. Some cities have higher minimum wages. And I don't know of an area, although I bet they do exist, perhaps a very rural small town area, I don't know of an area in the United States where an employer could get a decent employee for a minimum wage.</p><p>When I hire immigrant, non-skilled laborers here locally where I live in South Florida, the going rate right now is $12 an hour or $11 an hour if you're hiring at 11 a.m. But very rarely will an unskilled immigrant laborer work for less than $12 an hour where I live.</p><p>$7.25 an hour if you work a 40-hour workweek. And at this level, you need to work 52 weeks per year. You probably need to do a lot more than 40 hours a week. But your gross wage on a minimum wage job would be $15,000 per year. So minimum wage, $7.25 an hour is $15,000 per year.</p><p>Now at this particular level of income, you would pay $0 in taxes. Now of course you do have employment taxes. Remember that when you are working in a job in the United States of America, you pay employment taxes. The employee share of the employment taxes is 7.65% or $1,150 per year of that $15,000 income.</p><p>But at this level of income, you pay no federal income taxes. And I'm going to ignore the employment tax cost because that employment tax cost would be offset by other extant tax credits such as the earned income tax credit or perhaps various welfare benefits that you would be eligible for.</p><p>So let's assume that you pay $0 in taxes. On a $15,000 budget, if your ambition is to give away 10% of your income, that means that you can give $1,500 per year to others who are in need. If your ambition is to save 10% of your income, on a $15,000 budget, you can save $1,500 per year.</p><p>Between your giving and your saving, you've now allocated $3,000 of your budget and you are left with $12,000 per year, $1,000 per month to use to arrange your living expenses. Now if that budget, we take 30% of that budget and we allocate it towards housing, that means you can afford a $300 a month house or housing arrangement.</p><p>If 10% of your income, which is a normal number, is dedicated towards utilities, you have $100 a month available for utilities, water, electricity, phone, internet. If you allocate 15% of your budget toward transportation, that leaves you with $150 per month for transportation. Car payment, gas, insurance, etc. If you allocate 15% of your income for food, you have $150 per month available for your food.</p><p>5% of your budget allocated towards health and medical expenses, that leaves you with $50 per month. If you set a 5% entertainment budget, you have $50 per month, which leaves you with 20% of your budget available for miscellaneous expenses, about $200 per month. Friends, that's doable for a single person who's very flexible or for a young person or an old person who has a strong family support network.</p><p>It's not really doable for anybody else. My scorecard for this particular level of income is your giving potential is limited. If you give $1,500 per year over the course of a 40-year career, you'll be able to give away about $60,000. That's good, but I call that limited. Your wealth building potential, it's tough to build wealth.</p><p>Doable but tough, and the potential is very limited. If you're investing $1,500 per year for 40 years at a 5% rate of return, you'll wind up with about $181,000 portfolio at the end of 40 years. It's not bad, but it certainly is limited. Your lifestyle potential on a minimum wage job is very limited.</p><p>Again, it may be possible to support an individual, especially a very skilled individual who is very good at living on the fringes of society. But it's not possible to support a family on a minimum wage job. If you are unemployed, your first goal should be to become employed. You will become employed at a minimum wage level at the very least.</p><p>But if you are working a minimum wage job, your first goal should be to stop working a minimum wage job and to start making more because it's limited. You're limited in your ability to give, you're limited in your ability to build wealth, and your lifestyle potential is very limited.</p><p>Your target should be to move from a minimum wage job to a median wage job. Now, of course, the median, that term means that 50% of households earn more than that and 50% of households earn less than that. So when looking at something like income, the median wages or the median lifestyle is a very useful metric.</p><p>It's more useful than the mean or average income or average level of expenses. In the United States of America in 2016, the US median wage was $59,039. You'll forgive me if I just call it $59,000 here among friends. At this level of income, your annual taxes would be about $9,000.</p><p>You would have about $4,500 of employment taxes and about $4,500 of income taxes on a $59,000 per year job. That leaves you with $50,000 after taxes. Assume that you establish a 10% giving budget, that leaves you with the ability to give away $5,000 per year. You establish a 10% savings budget, that leaves you with the ability to save $5,000 per year.</p><p>The remainder, $40,000 per year, is going to be allocated toward expenses. Well, 30% of that $40,000 for housing leaves you with a housing budget of $1,000 a month. 10% toward utilities leaves you with a utilities budget of $330 per month. 15% of your budget for transportation leaves you with $500 per month for transportation.</p><p>15% for food leaves you with $500 a month for food. 5% for health and medical is $160 a month. 5% for entertainment, $160 per month. And you have an additional 20% slush fund for miscellaneous expenses of $650 per month. Now think about those numbers, $1,000 a month for housing.</p><p>In your area, you should be able to find a reasonable place to live that's safe and dry for $1,000 a month. $330 a month for utilities. In your area, you should be able to find a way to pay for electricity and water and internet or phone, cell phone, home phone, et cetera, for $330 a month.</p><p>$500 a month for transportation, you should be able to arrange the purchase of a vehicle, insurance and fuel costs on $500 a month. $500 a month on food, you should be able to feed yourself and your family on $500 a month of food. Health and medical, $160 a month for dental expenses, vitamin supplements, gym, et cetera, doable.</p><p>Entertainment, $160 a month, adequate. Gives you $2,000 a year to spend on a family vacation or various entertainment options if that's what you want to do. And an additional $8,000 per year or $650 a month for miscellaneous expenses. Here's how I rate this particular level of income. Giving potential is effective.</p><p>If you give away $5,000 per year for 40 years, you'll give away $200,000. Wealth building potential, I call that moderate. If you invest $5,000 per year for 40 years at a 5% mean rate of return, you'll wind up with $600,000 in your portfolio after 40 years. Lifestyle potential, I call it adequate.</p><p>It's possible to support a family at this particular level of income. And with wise spending choices, I believe you could live in reasonable comfort. Wouldn't call it luxury, but I would call it reasonable comfort. The more skillful you are in allocating money and in managing expenses, the better. But lifestyle potential here is adequate.</p><p>So if you are on a minimum wage job, you should target moving to a median wage job. Now your next target is to move to the top 20% of income earners. I'm convinced that every one of you listening to this show can move into the top 20% of income earners.</p><p>I don't believe that everybody in society can move into the top 20% of income earners because obviously, mathematically, if everyone in society moved, it just wouldn't work. But more importantly is not everybody in society has adequate cognitive ability. Not everyone has adequate skills. Not everyone has just adequate physical ability to actually produce enough value to move into the top 20% of income.</p><p>But I speak at a very high level, at the very least college if not master's degree level with my vocabulary, the concepts, the way that I speak, et cetera. And so if you're listening to my voice now and if you're understanding what I'm saying, if you're grasping at least the basis of these concepts, you have sufficient cognitive ability and sufficient motivation and sufficient vocabulary, sufficient practical tools to move into the top 20% of income earners.</p><p>In the United States, if you look at the total level of income, according to the 2016 reports from census.gov, the 80th percentile limit of income is $121,018. So if you want to move into the top 20% of income, you should target $121,000 per year as your annual income. Now why is this important?</p><p>Because the top 20% of income earners earn 80% of the money. Most things in life seem to be distributed according to a Pareto distribution, 20/80. So the top 20% of income earners actually earn 80% of the money available. Whereas the bottom 80% of income earners earn only 20% of the money available.</p><p>Picture flows of revenue and income like a giant river. There are some people that go into that river with a little tiny teaspoon. There are some people that take a bucket. And there are some people that build a pipeline. I think you could imagine that if there are some people with a teaspoon and some people with a pipeline taking water out of that river, now you can see why 20% of the income earners earn 80% of the income.</p><p>Now the cool thing about it is nobody has to take a teaspoon. Nobody has to take a pipeline. Some people come to the river with their teaspoon, they dip out a little bit of water, they put it in their mouth and they go away. Some people come to the river with a teaspoon, they dip out a little water, they fill their mouth and they start filling up buckets.</p><p>And they take those buckets, they sell it to other people that didn't want to walk to the river with their teaspoon. They make a profit, they come back and they put more money in the buckets, they keep selling the buckets to other people. Then when they have enough money, they build a pipeline.</p><p>That's how money works. The cool thing about it is those options are available to you. But you got to start that process. You take your teaspoon to the river, you slake your thirst, that's what we've talked about with minimum wage jobs, and you start tucking away water to sell to other people.</p><p>You rent out your money. That's called investing. You rent out your money to other people who want to use that money. That's how you build wealth. You develop your skills, you invest in your own tools. You take your teaspoon, you rent somebody else's bucket, you fill it with water, you take that bucket and you sell it to them.</p><p>Then you buy a teaspoon from somebody else, so you have two teaspoons now, so you can fill your bucket twice as fast. Then you sell that bucket and you come back and you buy a little cup. You take the cup and you put it into the bucket and you sell your bucket now about five times as fast.</p><p>That's how money works. That's how wealth building works. You take what you have, your physical ability to dip water out of the river, you take whatever tools are at your disposal and you figure out how to use those tools to sell to other people, sell the product to other people who are either too lazy or too rich to go and get their own water.</p><p>And then in time, you expand your capacity and your capability. So you, because you are listening to this, you've already demonstrated sufficient motivation, sufficient cognitive ability to move from the bottom 80% of income earners to the top 20% of income earners in time. It takes time to fill a bucket with a teaspoon.</p><p>It takes time to go and sell that water. Takes time to fill a bucket with a cup. Takes time to sell that water. It takes time to fill a bucket with a hose and sell that water. It takes time to buy more buckets, takes time to buy a truck, and it takes time and money to build a pipeline.</p><p>But it's doable. Top 20% of income, $121,000 per year. At this level of earnings, your taxes would be about $21,000 per year. Of course, you would have $9,000 of employment taxes. Here we're still near the Social Security wage base, so still about 7.65% for employment taxes. And your income taxes, if we assume that you save about $10,000 in an IRA or qualified plan, a loose estimate of your income taxes here would be about $12,000 per year.</p><p>So on $121,000 income, you're going to pay $21,000 in taxes. You set aside 10% of your income for giving to others who are in need. That's $10,000 per year. You save 10% of your income. That's $10,000 per year. The remaining 80% of your income is allocated towards expenses. That gives you a budget of $80,000 per year.</p><p>30% of that goes to housing, $2,000 a month. As I go through these numbers, think about your area and what's available in your area. What kind of house can you rent for $2,000 per month? 10% goes towards utilities, $650 per month. Is that adequate for the utilities in your area for a $2,000 a month house?</p><p>15% goes to transportation. That gives you a budget of $1,000 a month between cars, car payment, insurance, gas, et cetera. 15% is allocated towards food. That gives you a food budget of $1,000 a month. You're starting to move out of basic and into luxury. You can afford the fancier cuts of meat.</p><p>You can afford more organic produce. You can afford a little bit more eating out, a fine restaurant from that time to time. Health and medical at 5%, that's $330 a month. You can afford some better nutritional supplements. You can afford a higher quality medical practitioner. You can afford to be on the chiropractor's normal monthly plan.</p><p>5% is allocated towards entertainment. That gives you a budget of $4,000 per year or $330 per month. We still have a 20% miscellaneous expense slush fund. Comes out to about $1,300 per month. My scorecard on this level of income. Giving potential is effective. $10,000 given per year over 40 years is almost half a million dollars, $400,000 given away.</p><p>Wealth building potential, effective. $10,000 per year invested over 40 years at a 5% rate of return equals a portfolio value of $1.2 million. And your lifestyle potential here is excellent. It's possible for you to support a family in comfort. You're able to consume the higher grade products and services.</p><p>And there's plenty of wiggle room, especially if you're a skilled spender. I've known a lot of people with $121,000 income who don't feel rich, but that's because they were mediocre spenders. All they know how to do is write checks and swipe cards and not how to get a good value for their money.</p><p>You can fix that, and we'll fix that another time when I talk to you about a decreased expenses course in the future. Your target at the minimum should be to move into the top 20% of your occupation of income earners. I bet if you will analyze your industry, the top 20% of income earners earn at least $121,000 per year.</p><p>I've known a lot of guys in the trades, blue collar trades, who've earned $120,000 a year. There are some occupations that are, of course, tilted higher, in which case the top 20% of that occupation is much higher. But on the whole, $121,000 a year is top 20%. You should set that as a target and make a plan to achieve it quickly.</p><p>Give me a 15-year-old young man with good cognitive ability, strong work ethic, basic social skills, and strong personal ethics. All of those are important. Again, I repeat, good cognitive ability. You have to be able to process abstract concepts. If you're in an industry where you can't process the abstract concepts of your industry, move to one where you can.</p><p>But give me a 15-year-old man with good cognitive ability, personal skills, personal interaction skills, a good work ethic, and personal integrity and personal ethics. He's not going to steal from his boss. He's not going to be ripping off his boss because he's hanging out on Facebook on the clock.</p><p>Give me a 15-year-old young man or woman and give me the industry, and in five to 10 years, we can go from minimum wage to top 20% of $120,000. I can do it in the trades, and so can you. If you're not in the trades, there are many options for you.</p><p>What else should you target as a goal? Well, I think you should move into the top 5%. In a parade of distribution, the 20/80 continues to function. So if you look at an analysis of income earners in the United States of America, the top 20% of income earners earn 80% of the total income, but in the top 20%, the same case exists.</p><p>So in the top 20%, the top 20% of the top 20% earn 80% of the top 20% of income, or about 64% of total income. And then the top 20% of the top 20% of the top 20% earn 80%, et cetera, and it goes on, which is why if you work the numbers, I can't remember the latest analysis, you wind up with a dozen.</p><p>You wind up with a couple hundred people in the world that own, what is it, 30%, 40% of all the assets, or you wind up with a couple of dozen who own 20% of all the assets. You wind up with this. It's the same Pareto principle on and on.</p><p>I don't know if everybody can go from the bottom 80% to the top 20. No, sorry, let me rephrase. I believe that you, not everybody can go from the bottom 80% to the top 20%, but you can. I don't know if you can go from the bottom 80% of the top 20% into the top 20% of the top 20%, which is basically the top 4% or 5%, but I think you can.</p><p>I don't know if you should make it your ambition to go higher. I personally don't have any ambition to be the number one person in my field. I used to set that as a goal. When I was a financial planner, I would run the numbers and I would figure out what it meant to be the top, the very top, but the price was always too high.</p><p>When I calculated what would be necessary in order for me to achieve that, I decided that the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. The price was too high. So you can't fake it. You can't get there by accident. The people who are at the very top have sacrificed other areas of their life, and I came to the realization that I wasn't willing to sacrifice like they did.</p><p>Wasn't worth it. But moving into the top 5% total is probably doable and is probably adequate for most people. Now in the United States, the 95th percentile of income is $225,251 according to the 2016 census data. It wasn't the 2016 census, but from the census bureaus where I'm citing and sourcing my figures.</p><p>So let's call it $225,000 per year. I think you should set as your target to earn $225,000 per year in your occupation. Now what will that buy you? Well at a $225,000 income, you'll pay about $50,000 per year in taxes. Your employment taxes would be about $11,150. We would max out the social security wage base, a total social security tax of $7,886 and the Medicare tax of $3,262, or a total employment tax of $11,150.</p><p>By the way, if these numbers are making your head spin and you want to see them written, I am speaking to you very loosely from a module in the Increase Income course. Arsenalfinance.com/increaseincome on sale right now. Talk to you about that in a moment when I'm done. But I'm reading to you from a module.</p><p>All of this is written down. All of this is part of your notes in that particular module. My presentation in that module is much tighter, more edited. This particular presentation I'm giving to you now is more free form, but this is one of the modules in that course with all the numbers.</p><p>So employment taxes on a $225,000 per year salary would be just over 11 grand and your income taxes would be about $39,000. That's just a loose estimate. I'm assuming $20,000 in qualified plan contributions and two dependents. For a total taxes of about $50,000 per year. That leaves you with $175,000 available after taxes.</p><p>Assume that you give 10% of your income away. That leaves you with $17,500 per year in your giving budget. Now here in your savings, let's bump it up from that standard 10% number we've been using to 20%. After all, at this level of earnings, significantly increased savings should easily be available without sacrificing lifestyle.</p><p>So let's move up your savings from 10% to 20%. That's a total of $35,000 per year saved. We're left with 70% for expenses or $122,500 per year. Let's call it 10 grand a month. If 30% of that is allocated towards housing, we've got $3,000 a month. What kind of house can you rent in your town for $3,000 a month?</p><p>If 10% is for utilities, we've got $1,000 per month. Can you meet all of your utility needs in abundance on $1,000 a month for a $3,000 house? If 15% is allocated toward transportation, we've got $1,500 a month. Can you meet your transportation needs in luxury on $1,500 a month?</p><p>15% is allocated towards food, that's $1,500 a month. Can you meet your nutrient needs in luxury on $1,500 a month? Health and medical 5%, $500 a month. Entertainment 5%, and we're left with a 20% or $2,000 a month miscellaneous expense slush fund for other expenses. How do I rate this particular level of income?</p><p>Well, giving potential is excellent. If you give away $17,500 per year for 40 years, you would give away $700,000, three-quarters of a million dollars. I would rate here your wealth-building potential as excellent. If you invest $35,000 per year for 40 years at a 5% interest rate, you would wind up with a portfolio value of $4.2 million.</p><p>I call that excellent. And your lifestyle potential here is excellent. It's possible for you to support family and even extended family in luxury and comfort. You'll be able to consume the highest grades of products and services. There's plenty of monthly surplus for spontaneous expenditures and adventures. This is the land of abundance.</p><p>The land of abundance is found in the top 5%. Excellent giving potential, excellent wealth-building potential, and excellent lifestyle potential. So in conclusion, the best way for you to be able to give a lot of money away, to become enormously wealthy, and to enjoy a rich and rewarding lifestyle every year of your career is for you to build a high income.</p><p>A high income allows you to do all of these well. So target the top 5% of income earners for your personal income. Target $225,000 per year. You don't have to earn $225,000 per year in order to live well. I give this to you as a goal and to stimulate your thinking.</p><p>As I've shown, minimum wage is meager, median wage is adequate, top 20% is good, and top 5% is excellent. If you'll set these as a goal, you'll be open to the ways to get there. Again, I emphasize, I didn't use the top 1%. Sometimes you got to sell your soul to the devil to get into the top 1%.</p><p>Sometimes you got to live at the office to get into the top 1%. I don't think that's a good plan. But you can live well on 5% because of the money that comes in, and you can find a position in the top 5% that gives you enough income to live well.</p><p>If you'd like my help in working with you to create a plan for you, I'd love for you to join the Radical Personal Finance Increase Income course that I have open right now.

There's guidance on how to switch to a new career. If you look at your career and say, "I can't earn $225,000 on my career," well, you might need to change. But you can take what you love about that career and move it into something else or split your time.</p><p>In addition, there are...
