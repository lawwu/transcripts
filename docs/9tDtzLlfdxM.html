So think carefully about the title.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tDtzLlfdxM&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The program chairs assign reviewers their papers, presumably based in large part on their bids,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tDtzLlfdxM&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">although having bid on lots of conferences, I have very little evidence that my bids are actually shaping which things get assigned to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tDtzLlfdxM&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But I still do my bidding. Reviewers read the papers, write comments and supply ratings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tDtzLlfdxM&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll give you a glimpse of what that's like in a second. Authors are allowed to respond briefly to the reviews.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tDtzLlfdxM&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the so-called author response period. It's a very tight time window in which you have a very constrained amount of text to use to respond to the reviews,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tDtzLlfdxM&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">object to mistakes, answer questions and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tDtzLlfdxM&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Then the program or area chair stimulates discussion among the reviewers about conflicts between the reviewers or conflicts with the author response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tDtzLlfdxM&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And in general, the idea is that this discussion will get clarity on whether the paper should be accepted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tDtzLlfdxM&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And then finally, the program committee does some magic to arrive at the final program based on all of this input.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tDtzLlfdxM&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You might get a meta review that provides some insight into the final decision making.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tDtzLlfdxM&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But I can more or less guarantee for you that in the end, the decision making might be pretty opaque, especially in the final stages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tDtzLlfdxM&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what we have to live with, I guess, when we enter into the sort of lottery like NLP conference set up for reviewing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tDtzLlfdxM&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's a look at the form that reviewers are typically dealing with. You know, these used to be based mainly in structured data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tDtzLlfdxM&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Now it's more like structured text. The first box will ask, what is the paper about? What contributions does it make?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tDtzLlfdxM&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And what are the main strengths and weaknesses? This is a great question because I think it's trying to check in with a reviewer and make sure they actually know what the paper is about and what its contributions are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tDtzLlfdxM&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">After that come the important pieces. Reasons to accept. Reasons to reject.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tDtzLlfdxM&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.780</a></span> | <span class="t">For better or worse, both of these will be required boxes and reviewers will think of something to type in both.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tDtzLlfdxM&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I resist this, particularly for reasons to reject.
