by the RRT algorithm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=410">00:06:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's trying to unpark now, go there, so as you can see, the trajectories are going back and then going towards the obstacles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=417">00:06:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's generating these trajectories, picking the best one.</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=422">00:07:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It worked okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=423">00:07:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see the performance as it's running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=426">00:07:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a video that's made about 30 times faster, kind of showing you how the thing works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=431">00:07:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When we switched to the forklift kind of algorithm, forklift platform, I started working on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=438">00:07:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the one thing that we realized is that, you know, the forklift tries to go here to park in front of a truck, and it finds this trajectory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=446">00:07:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">At some point, it discovers there's an obstacle here, and it finds this looping trajectory, and it never gets out of that loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=452">00:07:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You would think that it's trying to minimize the path length, so you would think that it would be easier to come up with something that just kind of turns left and aligns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=459">00:07:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it turns out that once you have that loop, even if you add more samples to it, you're stuck with that loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=464">00:07:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you would never improve this type of trajectory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=468">00:07:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So back in the day, Professor Seth Teller, who passed away, unfortunately, a couple years ago, but he really pushed me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=475">00:07:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He was telling me this doesn't work, and every time it just makes this loop right in front of the army generals who are the sponsor, and it just looks ridiculous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=483">00:08:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to fix this kind of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=484">00:08:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And trying to find a fix for it, we realized that the algorithm actually has some fundamental flaws in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=490">00:08:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So specifically, we were able to kind of write down a formal proof that the RRT algorithm actually fails to converge to optimal solutions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=497">00:08:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is kind of something interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=498">00:08:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you would think that if you had more samples, you would get better and better trajectories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=503">00:08:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it turns out that the first few trajectories that you found, it just constrains you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=508">00:08:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it closes the space that you want to search, and you're stuck with bad trajectories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=513">00:08:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this almost always happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=515">00:08:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes you're lucky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=516">00:08:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Your bad trajectory is kind of good enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=518">00:08:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But most of the time, it's pretty bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=521">00:08:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We were able to come up with another algorithm that we called RRT*, which just does a little bit more work, but guarantees asymptotic optimality, meaning it will always converge to optimum solutions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=533">00:08:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the computational difference between the two is very little.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=536">00:08:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you were to run them side by side, RRT* tree would look like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=541">00:09:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What it's doing is it's just looking at the paths locally, and it's just kind of correcting them locally just a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=547">00:09:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that little bit correction is enough to converge to globally optimal trajectories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=553">00:09:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that turned out to be my doctoral thesis back in 2011, and we applied it to a number of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=558">00:09:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me show you one simulation scenario.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=560">00:09:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Imagine a race car coming into a turn, wants to turn very quickly, generates these trajectories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=566">00:09:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the right thing to do is to kind of slow down a little bit, start skidding, hit one end of the road, now start speeding up and go as fast as possible so that you hit the other end of the road and you complete the turn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=577">00:09:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">These kind of things would come out just naturally from the algorithm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=581">00:09:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You wouldn't have to program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=582">00:09:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to do these kind of things, but you just run the algorithm and this is the best trajectory it finds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=588">00:09:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It would be impossible to get something like this from an RRT.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=593">00:09:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We applied it to a number of other robots as well, I don't know, like PR2 type robots or these autonomous forklifts and got good results out of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=602">00:10:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that kind of maybe gives you a bit of an idea of my background, meaning like my graduate school experience a little bit and the PhD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=610">00:10:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me kind of tell you a bit quickly what my research group does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=615">00:10:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I always say sort of, so we do a lot of things in a fortunate and unfortunate way, so it's hard to find a focus sometimes admittedly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=623">00:10:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I usually tell people that we work on autonomous vehicles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=626">00:10:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The problem is quite interesting both at the vehicle level, meaning how are you going to build these autonomous vehicles individually, and also interesting at a systems level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=634">00:10:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you think about it, most of the autonomous vehicle is most valuable if you put them into a system that they can work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=640">00:10:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me give you some examples. So a system of autonomous vehicles would be, for example, this Kiva system scenario.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=646">00:10:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, nowadays you buy something from Amazon, the way you buy two books, the way it's packed is that books are brought by robots to a picker and the picker just puts them into the same box and sends it to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=656">00:10:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is done by 500 autonomous vehicles, for example, that would be a good example of a system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=662">00:11:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Another one is that there are ports around there in the world, you know, that are working just completely with autonomous vehicles and cranes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=668">00:11:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you project a little bit forward, you can think maybe, you know, you can have drone delivery systems and they maybe don't have enough batteries, so they have to relay packages to one another, so you need to build a system of autonomous vehicles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=679">00:11:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or if you have, I don't know, like autonomous cars, maybe it's best to use them in like an Uber-like scenario, so you can have autonomous taxis that they can work together and such.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=689">00:11:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me tell you a bit more on the vehicle level problems and the system level problems, some of the crazy things that we try to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=696">00:11:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">On the vehicle level, we're interested in all aspects of both perception and planning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=701">00:11:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Usually, challenges are sort of either complexity or either computational complexity, so it's very hard just computationally, so you really need to innovate, or it's just the system becomes very complex, so you need to figure that out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=714">00:11:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're, for example, recently motivated by really fast and agile kind of vehicles, how we can build that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=720">00:12:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like one thing that we were motivated, for example, is sort of like imagine there's a drone flying and you want to catch it in the fly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=729">00:12:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I wonder if this is going to play.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=733">00:12:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, it turns out that Netherlands police, some people fly UAVs around and you somehow want to take it down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=739">00:12:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not like you can shoot at it, so people train eagles and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=743">00:12:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we thought it would be great to actually build these types of robots that we try to in our group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=749">00:12:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can, once you start to do these kind of things, you wonder like how much I can push the boundaries of very, very agile vehicles and systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=757">00:12:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here you're going to see a falcon diving for a prey.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=762">00:12:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to see a goose right at the last like a split second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=766">00:12:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at the scene from a 20 hertz camera, this is what you would see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=769">00:12:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they are definitely much faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=771">00:12:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They do very complicated, you know, planning and maneuvering to be able to do these kind of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=776">00:12:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, in the research group, we look at a number of different perception problems where you're multi agents, you have ultra high rate cameras.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=782">00:13:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, for example, we have drones with 200 hertz cameras on them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=786">00:13:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you're trying to understand the person that you're tracking, its dynamics, its intentions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=792">00:13:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">On the control level, you're trying to pull off really complicated maneuvers like the one that you've seen in the race car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=797">00:13:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you want to do it in real time at like a kilohertz probably.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=800">00:13:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So how can you do these types of things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=803">00:13:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We use a lot high performance computing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=806">00:13:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, the drones that we have actually have GPUs on them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=809">00:13:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They fly GPUs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=810">00:13:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They fly like teraflop computers to be able to do these kind of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=813">00:13:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We also use them offline like the deep learning computers that you would use normally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=817">00:13:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have access to things like DGX1 and so on that we use that to compute controllers, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=824">00:13:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's an example of, I don't know, like one GPU drone just kind of passing through a window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=829">00:13:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is from a long time ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=831">00:13:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">These are the controllers that we would compute on supercomputers that we would deploy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=835">00:13:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And on the perception side, for example, we're looking at things where like you can use visual macronometry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=840">00:14:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can just have a camera and just look through the world from the camera and try to understand your own position.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=845">00:14:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have certain algorithms to pick the features just right so that you can do these things with just like 10 features or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=851">00:14:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it is computationally very efficient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=854">00:14:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">On the systems aspects of things, when you put them together--yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=858">00:14:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">[Audience

need--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=925">00:15:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it would be very surprising if that maneuver

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=940">00:15:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we do is, to be able to compute these things, we take very simple controllers, like for example, zero.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=946">00:15:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't do anything.</span></div><div

compressed versions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=952">00:15:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then that compressed version

<span class="t">That's probably essentially what you would need, rather than 3 terabytes, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=965">00:16:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We use kind of singular value decomposition type techniques to do compression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=969">00:16:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You may have done the same thing using images, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=973">00:16:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you compress an image, JPEG, you save an order of magnitude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=977">00:16:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No surprise, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=979">00:16:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you compress video, you save two, three orders of magnitude, because video is three-dimensional.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=984">00:16:24.000</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">So when you compress this way, this saves ten orders of magnitude, which honestly is no surprise, when you think about it a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=993">00:16:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So those are the control, like the planning and control algorithms that we use.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=998">00:16:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we compute them in, I don't know, five minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1001">00:16:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That gives you a lookup table that's 2 megabytes you put in so that you can quickly execute it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1006">00:16:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That lookup table is essential if you want to do a kilohertz control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1009">00:16:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You won't be able to compute a trajectory at that rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1014">00:16:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. That question came in, and that's the whole talk in terms of present of motion planning, and I can show you some other stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1022">00:17:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a lot to do, especially in terms of agility on the systems domain as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1025">00:17:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I don't know, I pulled up -- this is not the kind of stuff that -- the only stuff that we do, but I pulled up the most interesting thing, I think, maybe the most crazy thing of my hard disk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1034">00:17:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Imagine you have a whole bunch of vehicles coming to an intersection.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1039">00:17:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How would you make it so that they would pass through the intersection as fast as possible?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1044">00:17:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1045">00:17:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you were to really utilize algorithms that would do that, here is what I would look like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1049">00:17:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you would have vehicles coming in, and you could -- it looks like --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1053">00:17:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so you probably don't want to sit in this vehicle, but just sort of like -- just to understand the fundamental limits of the situation, just to understand how far you can push these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1062">00:17:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see it looks like they're getting very lucky, but really what's happening is that they're just speeding and slowing down just so little so that they can avoid one another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1071">00:17:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can actually sit down and do some math and try to understand, you know, given the dynamics, like your acceleration/deceleration limits, how fast you can push these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

existing, like, multi-vehicle setups, like Kiva systems or ports and things like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1189">00:19:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we are far away from this kind of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1192">00:19:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The main problem, some of it is control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1195">00:19:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we don't understand the control aspects, but we also don't trust our sensors and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1199">00:19:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's another big problem.</span></div><div

implementation is on the sensor side, I'd say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1209">00:20:09.000</a></span> | <span

number of other projects currently as well on autonomous vehicles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1220">00:20:20.000</a></span> |

we're hoping to build 30 so that we can put them in --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1243">00:20:43.000</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1250">00:20:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for example, you can feed them into deep learning algorithms.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1279">00:21:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I am also a lead PI together with sort of working with Daniela Rus on MIT's effort with Stanford and Toyota to build safer vehicles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1291">00:21:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, I'm still a PI on the MIT-Singapore partnership.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1295">00:21:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We are now from golf carts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1297">00:21:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We've moved into doing these electric vehicles, and we're working on basically integrating a lot of electric vehicles together to make them kind of work nicer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1307">00:21:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're also kind of now looking into an autonomous kind of wheelchair that's also in that project that I didn't show here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1315">00:21:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So my group works on like a number of other projects in this domain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1318">00:21:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Admittedly, my group is a bit more on the theory side as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1321">00:22:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe like half the group is a bit theory-oriented.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1325">00:22:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The other half is more experimental.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1327">00:22:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I usually say we have quite a spectrum in the group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1330">00:22:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we would have mathematicians, like I would have people who don't have any engineering degrees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1335">00:22:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, for example, we have one postdoc who is a mathematician by training, is a postdoctoral scholar here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1341">00:22:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have two undergraduate students whose undergraduate degrees are from mathematics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1348">00:22:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">On the other hand, we have sort of mechanical engineers and so on who would actually build these things throughout the group, and we're funded by a number of people throughout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1357">00:22:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, okay, that was supposed to be like a quick summary, an entrance into what I was going to talk about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1364">00:22:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me kind of tell you maybe our DARPA Urban Challenge effort so that I can tell you a little bit more about how we implemented these motion planning algorithms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1373">00:22:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If time allows, I could talk more broadly about motion planning algorithms, but I don't think we'll get a chance to, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1380">00:23:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to start with this effort, the DARPA Urban Challenge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1384">00:23:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm sure many of

just kick-started all this autonomous vehicles type bonanza that's been going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1395">00:23:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me introduce to you a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1396">00:23:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is -- DARPA did things called DARPA Grand Challenge 1 and 2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1401">00:23:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll tell you in a second what they are, but this is the third one

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1418">00:23:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So DARPA proposed this back in 2006.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1420">00:23:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They did the race in November 2007.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

million, so it was a good incentive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1437">00:23:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">89 teams entered

system integration, vehicle integration support.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1487">00:24:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of them are in the audience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1490">00:24:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we also had some vehicle engineering support from Olin College.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1494">00:24:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We had a first version of the vehicle where cables were coming out, and then Olin College came in and they packaged it nicely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1501">00:25:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We built a vehicle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1502">00:25:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It looked like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1503">00:25:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We took a Land Rover MR3.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1505">00:25:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Land Rover was one of the sponsors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1507">00:25:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But also it was nice that the vehicle was pretty big.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1512">00:25:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We put an EMC driver wire system to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1516">00:25:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is kind of a driver wire system for people who are disabled.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1519">00:25:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, for example, if you can't use your legs, they would give you like a little joystick-type device so that you can actuate, you know, gas and brake.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1526">00:25:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it came very handy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1527">00:25:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We used it to make our vehicle driver wire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1530">00:25:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We needed to put a lot of sensors on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1532">00:25:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to say -- I wish this wasn't recorded, but hey.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1537">00:25:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think our situation was the following.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1539">00:25:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There was a lot of other teams out there, and they were very experienced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1542">00:25:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They had done the other grand challenges before and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1546">00:25:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We were not as experienced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1548">00:25:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say that our team was talented but not experienced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1552">00:25:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we had a lot of sponsors, so we had a lot of money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1555">00:25:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So our strategy turned into if it fits on the vehicle, let's put it on the vehicle, and we'll figure out a way to use it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1562">00:26:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If we don't use it, it's dead weight, we'll just kind of carry it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1565">00:26:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So with that mindset, we ended up with five cameras, 16 radars, 12 planar laser scanners, one 3D laser scanner, and one GPS AMU unit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1576">00:26:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This was a lot of sensors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1577">00:26:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They generated a lot of data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1579">00:26:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You had to process it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1580">00:26:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we had to buy a 40 CPU, 40 gigs of RAM, quanta computer that normally at that time would run on like a Google server type thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1588">00:26:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was a server rack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1589">00:26:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Ten computers, essentially, that we had to put in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1595">00:26:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we used to joke that this was like the fastest mobile computer on campus or something, like both in terms of speed and compute power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1602">00:26:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this required a lot of energy, so we put on an internally mounted generator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1607">00:26:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this generates a lot of heat, so we put an air conditioner on top.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1610">00:26:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can kind of see it here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1611">00:26:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that became our vehicle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1613">00:26:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing to note, though, is that we just had -- the number of sensors was -- or the number of computers was large, but the sensor suit was very similar to the other people who had finished.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1623">00:27:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One important sensor was this 3D laser scanner that I'm going to show you in a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1628">00:27:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is the thing that sits on top of the vehicle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1630">00:27:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It looks like the Kentucky fried chicken type of bucket, and essentially what it has is that probably a lot of people here are familiar, but it has 64 lasers that measure range, and those 64 lasers are stacked up on a vertical plane, and that plane will turn in 15 hertz.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1648">00:27:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it will give you a 3D point cloud.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1650">00:27:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you drive with it in Harvard Square, here is what the raw data will look like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1655">00:27:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is colored by height.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1657">00:27:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're just looking at raw data, and you can easily pick up, I don't know, a bus here, another building, maybe a person, a bunch of others, so it gives you great data already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1667">00:27:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you could work with this, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1670">00:27:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we taught, so other teams taught.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1673">00:27:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This sensor is made by a company called Velodyne.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1676">00:27:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It came pretty much just in time for the urban challenge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1681">00:28:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My guess is that if you didn't have this 3D point cloud, it would be pretty hard to complete that challenge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1686">00:28:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There was only one team that didn't have it and complete it, and they had a 2D laser scanner that was kind of turning like they essentially built their own Velodyne.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1693">00:28:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1696">00:28:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we had also this sort of 12 planar laser scanners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1699">00:28:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You would need these kind of things to cover the blind spots of the vehicle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1702">00:28:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The thing is on top, so you're not seeing kind of very nearby.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1706">00:28:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We had five on the push brooms looking down and seven on the skirts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1710">00:28:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is kind of what it would look like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1712">00:28:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're seeing the curbs here and a bunch of other things, and the vehicles are very close to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1717">00:28:37.000</a></span> | <span

radars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1721">00:28:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Radars are great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1722">00:28:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They can see very far.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1723">00:28:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, laser scanners would see 70 meters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1725">00:28:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Radars would see twice as much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1727">00:28:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The problem is that they have a very narrow field of view.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1730">00:28:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we needed 16 of them to cover 27 degrees around the vehicle, 207 degrees around the vehicle, 270 degrees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1738">00:28:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, you can park somewhere and you can see this is meters per second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1741">00:29:01.000</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1744">00:29:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It helps quite a bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1746">00:29:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, we had five cameras in this configuration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1749">00:29:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We were using cameras to actually look at lane markings.</span></div><div

for any purpose of any kind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1758">00:29:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The other vehicles were just kind of working with the laser scanner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1761">00:29:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, we were mainly working with the laser scanner, but we were picking up lane markings with this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1767">00:29:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When we bought this GPS AMU unit, it was an expensive thing, but it would give you your position you would go with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1773">00:29:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The algorithmic stack, it gets pretty complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1777">00:29:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think by the end of the race, we would probably have, like, the active code that was running could be order hundreds of thousands of lines of C code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1787">00:29:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe like 200,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1789">00:29:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I remember the forklift, and that was about half a million lines of code.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1795">00:29:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it would count, like, 100 processes that are running, sending messages to one another on that 40-core system that you've seen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1804">00:30:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that would generate a huge software diagram.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1807">00:30:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I

would hopefully be within your grid map.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1836">00:30:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a motion planner that looks at the map, sees all the obstacles and everything, sees the goal point, and finds a path to get to the goal point using the RRT.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1845">00:30:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then once that trajectory is computed, it is passed to a controller that actually steers the vehicle that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1851">00:30:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've already shown you how the motion planner works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1854">00:30:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It just kind of computes these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1855">00:30:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's the goal point.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1860">00:31:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can run these things together to get, like, a good behavior.</span></div><div

going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1894">00:31:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For motion planning and things like that, it helped a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1896">00:31:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, on the day of the -- on the -- sort of, like, the day before the race, my 24/7 job was to keep simulating our algorithms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1904">00:31:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I had two computers, kind of start simulation here, start there, look at it.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1911">00:31:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So simulation really helped.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1913">00:31:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We had done some testing, but I don't think we actually -- I think the race itself was the furthest that we had driven without any human intervention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1922">00:32:02.000</a></span> | <span

remember this correctly, we had done, like, a 20-mile stretch or something like that, but we hadn't done as many.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1932">00:32:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So admittedly, we didn't have too much on the testing front going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1938">00:32:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The only reason why was because it's just we didn't have time to do this kind of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1942">00:32:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We -- so, I mean, we started maybe a year before that we put together some of the infrastructure, like, this message sending and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1952">00:32:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the vehicle itself, to test it in reality, the vehicle -- I think the race was in November.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1958">00:32:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We probably got this vehicle -- I mean, we had another vehicle before, but we got this one clean, I think it was April.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1965">00:32:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we put the sensors on or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1967">00:32:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So really, it was just the summertime that we had to test, and admittedly, we couldn't test much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1973">00:32:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Draper Laboratory helped out a lot with the testing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1976">00:32:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If we didn't have that, we probably wouldn't test any.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1979">00:32:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we would probably just kind of fail outright or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1982">00:33:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In this kind of thing, testing is very important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1984">00:33:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It will be very important for future as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1986">00:33:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Simulation will be very important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1988">00:33:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Simulation has come a long way, actually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1990">00:33:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, nowadays, you can -- I mean, you guys are working with simulators, you can see,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1993">00:33:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but there's a lot of other things that people are going to put out in the next year or two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=1998">00:33:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, like, we can nowadays render things that you can show it to people, and it's very hard to -- like, people don't see that it's a rendering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2006">00:33:26.000</a></span> | <span

then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2025">00:33:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that would be probably the right thing to do right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2027">00:33:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But back then, we had this one platform that, you know, you could just run the whole software stack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2033">00:33:53.000</a></span> |

could put it on a real vehicle or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2045">00:34:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So back then, we thought that would be the best thing to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2048">00:34:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">[

I think you would do things differently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2062">00:34:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Any other

so I thought that it would be just kind of great to give you guys some ideas, given the course in autonomous vehicles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2074">00:34:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's an example of a case that we got into.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2078">00:34:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what's happening here is we arrive at an intersection, and there's another car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2083">00:34:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's Cornell's car, and they're just sitting right in the middle of the intersection, and they don't seem to be moving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2088">00:34:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they've been sitting there for a few minutes before we even arrived.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2091">00:34:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So DARPA decided that they should let us go, and we're probably going to take over, and we'll do great, and it's going to be an important moment in robotics history, that for the first time, you know, a robot takes over another robot while the other robot is stuck, and it's going to be great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2106">00:35:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they decide to go forward with this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2108">00:35:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here is how we're seeing things from inside our car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2111">00:35:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Our car is right here, wants to go there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2114">00:35:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">RRT generates trajectories.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2116">00:35:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the car that we're seeing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2117">00:35:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're not seeing all of it, but we're seeing enough fraction of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2120">00:35:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to play it a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2124">00:35:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, like, we're actually able to turn around it, so I think I need to stop it somewhere, but let's look at here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2129">00:35:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've seen the whole car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2131">00:35:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The new goal point is further away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2134">00:35:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're generating these trajectories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2135">00:35:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It looks great.</span></div><div

wrote a paper together with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2142">00:35:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not unclear to them either, but my understanding is that they think that the obstacle is on top of the car, and the way the algorithm is written is it just kind of generates a trajectory and asks if this trajectory is collision-free or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2155">00:35:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div

collision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2160">00:36:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just every time it passes that trajectory, because the route is in collision, it just says, you know, there's nothing there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2166">00:36:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They have another little piece where it just updates the map every time there's new information from the sensors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2172">00:36:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If there's no new information, there's no need to update.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2175">00:36:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they ended up getting stuck on this obstacle, and they're not refreshing their map because nothing is moving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2180">00:36:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Up until we move right next to them, they refresh again, and they say, oh, I'm actually not sitting on an obstacle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2186">00:36:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That was an error.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2188">00:36:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So next time the path comes going forward, it says this is a great path.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2191">00:36:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Go forward with it.</span></div><div

right now as I play it, the blob starts to move.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2201">00:36:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they are going in a direction that we are going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2205">00:36:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A quick thing will happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2207">00:36:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if our car at some point realizes that there's no paths, a collision is imminent, and there's nothing to do about it, it generates, it shows that white circle around it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2221">00:37:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that basically means that we are headed to a crash.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2233">00:37:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think at this time this camera is more fun to look at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2236">00:37:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can kind of take a look at it and sort of see what happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2240">00:37:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this kind of like collision happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2242">00:37:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We collide with the car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2244">00:37:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">DARPA, what they did is that they actually pulled the Cornell car back.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2250">00:37:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We finished.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2251">00:37:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They finished as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2252">00:37:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So both of the teams finished.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2254">00:37:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can see some of the things that are a little bit hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2256">00:37:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, if you yourself were to arrive at an intersection that there's a car that's sitting there, you probably would stop your car, take out, go and ask if there's anything wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2265">00:37:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Even if you don't do that, suppose you're not very decent of a human being, you decide not to do that, you would still steer away from that car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2272">00:37:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You probably wouldn't get as close to this car as we did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2275">00:37:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are some problems that are at the inference level that we do without even thinking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2280">00:38:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's actually kind of hard things for these types of cars to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2284">00:38:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Especially if you're going fast, you're in a complicated environment, you're not expecting things, and you might collide into things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2291">00:38:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We do different kinds of inference that we can't even name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2295">00:38:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, you look at the way a person walks on the sidewalk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2298">00:38:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can say, "Oh, you know, this person is kind of dangerous," or maybe you will walk into the street or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2304">00:38:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you make that decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2305">00:38:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's actually a pretty complicated thing for a robot to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2310">00:38:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so, you know, this is kind of like the results of the race.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2313">00:38:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not going to go too much into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2315">00:38:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, the idea is that 89 people started, 6 finished.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2318">00:38:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We were one of the finishers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2320">00:38:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">CMU came first, so they got the $2 million check, I believe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2324">00:38:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Stanford came second, they got a $1

a million.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2329">00:38:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We came fourth, we didn't get any money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2331">00:38:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, we got a lot of experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2333">00:38:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was great to be a part of it, I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2335">00:38:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One note is that the Google car that you may have heard a lot was essentially sort of like a spin-off from this race.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2343">00:39:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at the Google car, you will see that the sensing package is very similar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2347">00:39:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very laser scanner oriented.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2349">00:39:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It has a couple of radars on it that it could utilize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2353">00:39:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's working somewhat with the cameras, but not so much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2357">00:39:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Essentially, Google engineered this thing that we built, or all the other teams built independently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2362">00:39:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They engineered it for 10 years, and that's the kind of thing that they utilize nowadays.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2367">00:39:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's also like this whole Tesla brand of camera-based cars, of deep learning and so on, that's coming in just very recently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2374">00:39:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Back 10 years ago, you know, we knew about deep learning and so on, but it just didn't work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2380">00:39:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The moment somebody figured out doing it on a

a lot I can tell you about path planning, but I think here is kind of maybe what I should do if you do not mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2395">00:39:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Rather than telling you about RRTs and making this into a lecture that I'm not sure if you're going to like it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2400">00:40:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">let me talk maybe a little bit more about self-driving vehicles, and I think that's something that we might enjoy better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2407">00:40:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">[Audience member] Great question. So in one year, you built a self-driving car from scratch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2415">00:40:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a relatively small team. So the question is, what was the biggest challenge?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2428">00:40:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">[Slovenian] So the question is sort of building it from scratch, what was the biggest challenge?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2432">00:40:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to say, admittedly, I was a junior student back then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2437">00:40:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So my challenge was to get these controllers and some parts of the RRT working,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2441">00:40:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and I had simulation systems and things like that, and life was good for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2445">00:40:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would think that, I mean, we ended up building pretty complicated hardware, so that was one of the challenges.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2451">00:40:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that probably all in college, Draper, you know, they did all of that, that was great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2457">00:40:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The other challenge that we had is that nowadays there's like, maybe you guys use it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2460">00:41:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like robot operating system and so on, that infrastructure software.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2464">00:41:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We had none of that, so we ended up building our own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2467">00:41:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if anybody uses, but there's this thing called Lightweight Communications and Marshalling, LCM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2473">00:41:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that ended up being built for this, and it just kind of got spun out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2478">00:41:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That was another big challenge that we actually faced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2481">00:41:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So LCM nowadays is utilized throughout the industry, like for example, Ford autonomous cars will use it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2487">00:41:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Toyota will use it, Nutonomy uses it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2491">00:41:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it ended up coming out of this challenge, and it was probably like the first, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2497">00:41:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say the first six, seven months was kind of devoted to it, and for necessity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2502">00:41:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, we just, we wanted to do other things, but we just couldn't, because you needed something like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2506">00:41:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was another big challenge, I would say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2510">00:41:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Testing was a big challenge, things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2515">00:41:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So back then in the urban challenge days, it seemed like people were pretty collaborative,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2521">00:42:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">as far as working on autonomous vehicles goes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2524">00:42:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You publish papers, you publish a paper with, for the collision of a team and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2530">00:42:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But now it seems like autonomous vehicles are becoming much more isolated, like different companies competing and not collaborating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2537">00:42:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that going to be good, or is that going to be like, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2541">00:42:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, well, I guess it's good and bad. It's kind of hard to assess.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2545">00:42:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So competition is always good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2547">00:42:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question was that, you know, back in the day we were really collaborative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2553">00:42:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like it's very interesting that we actually wrote a paper with Cornell about our collision,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2557">00:42:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">just to teach the whole community why these kind of things happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2561">00:42:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But nowadays, like everybody is just kind of doing their own thing, and there's no kind of going out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2566">00:42:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a quick answer for that, and there's a kind of a broader answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2571">00:42:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the quick answer is that, yeah, I mean, it became important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2574">00:42:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of, you know, sort of people invested a lot of money,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2577">00:42:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and they are expecting returns and things like that, and that affects the environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2581">00:43:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That definitely drove it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2583">00:43:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we're still, you know, trying to work on it in academia and trying to publish papers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2587">00:43:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But a lot of people are, you know, worried about competing with these huge companies and things like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2593">00:43:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which I think is not a big worry because there's a lot to do still.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2598">00:43:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you look at the industry, there's little competition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2601">00:43:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But that, for some reason, the broader answer is that that became an

form labs, and they would publish, and they'd do science and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2617">00:43:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It would be very open.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2626">00:43:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that--I think Microsoft was the last big company of the day to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2632">00:43:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Nowadays, Google and

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2661">00:44:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">[Question]</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2684">00:44:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think it's purely an industry problem, because it's still kind of--it's quite complicated, honestly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2692">00:44:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there may be things that people can do, but I am wondering if DARPA would be interested in doing a challenge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2699">00:44:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's set DARPA aside differently and research otherwise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2702">00:45:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like when you think about DARPA, DARPA is a defense agency, and when they thought about the challenge,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2708">00:45:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they had, honestly, defense problems in mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2711">00:45:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, they didn't allow you to go around and drive in the area with your sensors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2716">00:45:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea was that they would give you a map of the environment 24 hours in advance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2721">00:45:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then five minutes before, they would give you a mission, like hit this waypoint, hit that waypoint, and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2726">00:45:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a military setting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2728">00:45:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They were really--the whole thing started with the U.S. Congress mandate to get, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2734">00:45:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">one-third of combat vehicles autonomous by 2015, which didn't happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2738">00:45:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it was a more military setting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2741">00:45:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So DARPA is usually sort of debt-minded, and they did the DARPA robot challenge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2746">00:45:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The current thing is a thing called fast lightweight autonomy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2749">00:45:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the idea is to build a quadcopter that can fly here 20 meters a second, like 40 miles an hour, in indoor environments type of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2757">00:45:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they'll do that, but there may be other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2759">00:45:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like there may be other, you know, people kind of coming in, pushing the boundary of research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2764">00:46:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like something, for example, just with cameras would be very interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2767">00:46:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we are just in a--we may be a couple years away from doing that very well, I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2775">00:46:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And probably deep learning would be a lot of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2779">00:46:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so I don't have much time, and I don't want to hold you here, but sort of, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2785">00:46:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">let me tell you a few things about autonomous cars in general,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2788">00:46:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and let's see if we can--you know, in like 10 minutes, we can fit something interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2794">00:46:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Transportation is a very interesting thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2796">00:46:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It actually defines how you live quite a bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2799">00:46:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at, for example, the kind of cities that, you know, many of you may be living in today, they look like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2806">00:46:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they are produced thanks to one invention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2809">00:46:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That was the affordable car, which was about a century ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2813">00:46:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look at it, you know, throughout the last century, like in 1950s, cars were big,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2818">00:46:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and you would find, you know, that everywhere these kind of subways were being constructed for the first time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2823">00:47:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason was cities were dirty, they were disease-prone, so now you had the car,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2828">00:47:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you could move away into a better living lifestyle, and it would improve it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2832">00:47:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and that was the 20th century invention that you had.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2835">00:47:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It also changed the cities quite a bit.</span></div><div

was built in, you know, '50s,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2844">00:47:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">at around that time, to kind of service the cars coming in and out of the city.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2850">00:47:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The cars kind of generated this kind of thing, you know, in some places at the extreme,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2854">00:47:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like if you go to places like Los Angeles in the United States, you would see the suburban sprawl.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2859">00:47:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very different in other places, so places that didn't have the time to expand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2864">00:47:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that didn't have the resources to expand, or just didn't have the place to expand, it caused many problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2870">00:47:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like here is the suburbia in Mexico City.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2873">00:47:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see the dirt that it generates in the distance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2876">00:47:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Even if you're rich, it doesn't really matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2879">00:47:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, even in rich countries, this quick expansion, it just doesn't work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2883">00:48:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and it creates, if anything, just ugly environments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2887">00:48:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in some places, it creates, like you need to be dense, and you need to be big,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2893">00:48:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and so you have the cars, but you just have to build, you know, big buildings that you cannot even serve with cars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2899">00:48:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it generates these type of things where, you know, like there's a--I think it's probably my--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2904">00:48:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was just going to say it only led to congestion and pollution in the rest of the world,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2908">00:48:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it generated these kind of things where--I don't know if you heard, there was a traffic jam in China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2912">00:48:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It lasted like nine days, and it was 100 miles long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2915">00:48:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it generated this kind of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2917">00:48:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just a quick introduction of the affordable car, sort of what it did to the environment in the cities there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2924">00:48:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So pollution is one problem and so on, but if you look through it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2928">00:48:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it's actually pollution and energy consumption-wise, a lot of it comes from the cars,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2933">00:48:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">especially inside the cities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2937">00:48:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">An interesting point is that if you look through the cars,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2940">00:49:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the cars are actually pretty inefficient the way they sort of sit currently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2946">00:49:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look through, for example, BMWs over the years, you would see that they get heavier and they get faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2952">00:49:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is very correlated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2953">00:49:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you get faster, you have to become heavier because you have to pass crash tests and things like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2958">00:49:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so you know you're--in order just to be faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2961">00:49:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in order to pass the crash test, you build structure and things like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2965">00:49:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and that makes the vehicle heavier ultimately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2968">00:49:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So like a BMW that you would buy in the '70s would weigh something like 2,500 pounds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2973">00:49:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Nowadays, it's like 4,000 pounds roughly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2978">00:49:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it would--if you look at the average passenger weight that it's carrying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2982">00:49:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it's about 25 times the weight of the passengers, and the size as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2987">00:49:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's about 10 times the size of the passengers that it carries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2991">00:49:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In terms of parking spots, if you look through the cities, there are places in the--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=2996">00:49:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">usually what we have in the United States is that for every car, we have two parking spots.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3000">00:50:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So roughly that's the number.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3002">00:50:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In some places, parking spots take up like half the city.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3005">00:50:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, in LA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3006">00:50:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">On average, it's about one-third.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3010">00:50:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you might ask the question like this is the kind of thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3013">00:50:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this is the kind of environment that cities created, and do you really want to live in this type of environment?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3018">00:50:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the answer is to kind of give you the idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3020">00:50:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean if you walk out, a lot of the infrastructure, a lot of the things that you see are made by cars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3026">00:50:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like for instance--and it really kind of interferes with your thinking as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3030">00:50:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So for instance, we never walk on the street nowadays.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3034">00:50:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like nobody jaywalks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3035">00:50:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Streets are for cars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3037">00:50:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like cars go on the streets, and we go on the sidewalk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3039">00:50:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't like that 100 years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3041">00:50:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You could walk on the streets however you wanted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3043">00:50:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Cars came in, and they took it over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3045">00:50:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it really changed the urban landscape quite a bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3048">00:50:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The point is that it seems like there's an opportunity today to actually kind of use 21st century technologies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3058">00:50:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This could be robotics, but a number of other things like online services, new business models, and things like that, and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3064">00:51:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe high-performance computer or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3066">00:51:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And to kind of service the needs of people in the cities.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3076">00:51:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3077">00:51:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think the kind of the service aspects of it goes away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3080">00:51:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you will need to--my guess what would happen is that I think people could be more mobile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3087">00:51:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think they want to be more mobile, but they're just not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3090">00:51:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If it was very accessible, very easy, I think they would be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3093">00:51:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there would be an increase in being mobile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3097">00:51:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But at the same time, resources are spent on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3101">00:51:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to pay for it somehow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3103">00:51:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you would still generate economic activity off of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3108">00:51:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, you would probably generate more economic activity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3111">00:51:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, the moment you change people's behavior, there's the way that you generate a new economic activity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3118">00:51:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if there's a way, for example, transportation is more available, more affordable, and it changes their behavior, it makes you more mobile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3125">00:52:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, for example, you're fine with having a class here and then 20 minutes later having a class at Harvard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3131">00:52:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Nobody would do that nowadays.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3133">00:52:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if it was that easy to get there, you would probably do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3135">00:52:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that would make you more mobile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3137">00:52:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the way, ultimately, it would generate more economic activity rather than buying cars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3142">00:52:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the service is still there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3143">00:52:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to pay for it somehow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3148">00:52:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Any other questions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3150">00:52:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the point is that you can use these type of technologies to do, for example, like mobility on demand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3155">00:52:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Whenever you need to be mobile, you can be mobile, or deliver things and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3161">00:52:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that -- let me just kind of -- I was going to tell you a bit of the history, but I think that I'm just going to pass it and tell you a few things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3173">00:52:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So autonomous vehicles are sort of one thing that you can utilize and you can actually do these types of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3179">00:52:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you can make this even better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3181">00:53:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, for example, you can integrate a few things into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3184">00:53:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing, you can integrate sharing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3186">00:53:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can make it in an Uber-type scenario.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3188">00:53:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can use autonomy as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3190">00:53:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, like electrification, especially if you're going a little bit slower so you don't have to pass crash tests and things like that, you could really reduce the cost of transportation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3201">00:53:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like to the point where you could imagine things like -- like you could go from anywhere to anywhere else for 99 cents in Boston with like five-minute wait time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3211">00:53:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to share your ride, it could be 50 cents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3214">00:53:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to admit to like one stop, a lot of us do one stop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3219">00:53:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you can take a subway and then take a bus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3221">00:53:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One stop makes your transportation much cheaper if you were to take an airplane.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3227">00:53:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Suppose if you wanted to take one stop, you could pay 30 cents and you could go anywhere to anywhere else in Boston.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3233">00:53:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there's a good opportunity to kind of, you know, push for things and utilize technology to bring the cost of transportation to a point or availability of transportation to a point to like really just change a lot of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3248">00:54:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not very easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3250">00:54:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The way I usually look at the technological landscape is that you can imagine sort of speed versus complexity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3256">00:54:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Speed is the speed of the vehicle that's being involved, that's involved in this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3260">00:54:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe complexity is the complexity of the environment that you're dealing with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3264">00:54:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you can have high-speed, low-complexity environments like highways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3268">00:54:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're actually easy to work with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3270">00:54:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We might actually conquer them like in the next, I don't know, three years or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3274">00:54:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Another thing would be like, for example, parks or university campuses or something much slower, but much more complex like people walking around and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3284">00:54:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Fully autonomous driving is probably pretty far, but there is some opportunity to do some interesting things elsewhere very quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3294">00:54:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the problems is that this is not just a technology problem, to be honest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3300">00:55:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As you have seen earlier, there's a lot of involvement in like, for example, architecture, like how do you actually utilize the city of the best and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3307">00:55:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the biggest problems ends up being this law and insurance and regulations aspects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3313">00:55:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There are good or bad things, like for example, sometimes you allow by the law to be able to do certain things, but then is it really like, is it a safety hazard?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3323">00:55:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it even ethical to kind of allow people to just kind of test stuff around?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3327">00:55:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a bit of a question, like whether or not this is the kind of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3331">00:55:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think sort of going forward, if I could say one thing to you guys is that this is just not like just a problem in sort of technology,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3340">00:55:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's also like a problem in technology, sort of society, policy, architecture, law, insurance, and business as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3347">00:55:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you may need new business models and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3349">00:55:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I personally think that it's right out there, but I think that we still need just a bit of more, like a better thinking to do to be able to attack this problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3362">00:56:02.000</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3517">00:58:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe a few questions if anybody has questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3521">00:58:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot of this class is about deep learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3523">00:58:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in terms of autonomous vehicles, deep learning is mostly focused on the vision sensor and cameras.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3531">00:58:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So how far are we away from a car that safely

<span class="t">So purely on the sensors, using the sensors and perception.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3547">00:59:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a bit of a guess game, to be honest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3549">00:59:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't somewhat the slides that I kind of passed through, but I am a big believer in computer vision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3557">00:59:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I do not think it's too far away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3560">00:59:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It just ends up being a bit of a guess game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3563">00:59:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's not -- I don't know how many of you have worked with cameras, but deep learning is one approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3571">00:59:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can also use geometric approaches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3573">00:59:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you can use a single camera and the motion of the car to build a 3D map of an environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3579">00:59:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">These are not too far away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3581">00:59:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Cameras are actually pretty good sensors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3583">00:59:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The only problem with cameras is that it's just a lot of data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3586">00:59:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's little information in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3588">00:59:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to fish it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3590">00:59:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you need computers to accompany it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3592">00:59:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It seems like the computers are coming out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3595">00:59:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's still hard to know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3597">00:59:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I would be surprised if in ten years you can't build a car that just has a bunch of cameras and navigates with cameras, period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3604">01:00:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It would be very surprising to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3606">01:00:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It would be also surprising if it happens next year, like some people are saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3611">01:00:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But in between these, I would think you would be able to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3616">01:00:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So once you -- like what I would suggest is if any of you is working with cameras, I would suggest deep learning is an excellent technique.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3623">01:00:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think you're kind of using it here, and I'm sure you're being surprised as it gives you the kind of information that you need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3630">01:00:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Try out model-based techniques as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3632">01:00:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're also coming along pretty well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3634">01:00:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So probably a solution that just integrates them as best as possible would be viable, I would guess, in three to five years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3642">01:00:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd be surprised otherwise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3645">01:00:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">>> I'm optimistic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3647">01:00:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3648">01:00:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Anybody have questions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3650">01:00:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Yes, the question was in autonomous intersections, what role the communication plays.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3655">01:00:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you wanted to do crazy things like I've shown you, you need to make sure everything communicates with everything else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3661">01:01:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That would break pretty badly if you don't do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3664">01:01:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would actually imagine that, like, one interesting thing to quickly do would be to have cars communicate with each other to do some interesting things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3672">01:01:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like not just maybe intersection but lane following and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3676">01:01:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like there are a few things that you may see pretty quickly with autonomous cars, like pretty quickly, I mean three to five years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3681">01:01:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this could be either V2V related, so communicate with other vehicles, vehicle to infrastructure related.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3689">01:01:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean you could, like, the deep learning and things like that, you could put up a camera on an infrastructure and people could tune into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3695">01:01:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The biggest problems are cybersecurity, to be honest, to deploy these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3699">01:01:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And on the autonomous vehicles end, you could see things like maybe not with communication, you could see either sharing, like, you know, you have a button, you press, you time share.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3708">01:01:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or you can have sharing with, you know, like, for example, you can use autonomy technology for safety, so that's a different type of sharing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3717">01:01:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or you can find autonomous vehicles in isolated environments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3720">01:02:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's stuff that you can do with communication.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3722">01:02:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you can quickly see lane following and maybe not intersections but things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3727">01:02:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">With autonomy, there are certain things that we might see, but they don't involve communication at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fLSf3NO0-s&t=3731">01:02:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's what would
