over-indexed for an export production economy at the expense of their own consumers and at the expense of real wealth generation, which happens also in the finance and tech sectors.</span></div><div

actually put in permitting reform, simple things, and he has to hold up or, you know, kill another bill to try to get these things in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
