I found both the Kama 2 system and the entire Kama AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=14">00:00:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">team and operation very impressive.

Yeah just start looping back to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=43">00:00:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">office. I mean I could enable it here but this isn't really where it shines. Yeah so we don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=49">00:00:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">have we don't have our license stop signs yet. Um I don't want to ship it until we have a real uh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=55">00:00:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">holistic one. Until we have an end to end one. So you'll be able to then like stop at a stop sign.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=61">00:01:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So the longitudinal control. Did you just enable it? I just enabled it yeah. So this is the uh so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=67">00:01:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">we're gonna have to stop at this light. But um how do you enable it? Uh cruise control. So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=77">00:01:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that's the the integrated knobs on the on the car. Yeah we have a good we'll go on the 163 a bit and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=85">00:01:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that's that's that's a good test of uh whether your level two system's any good. Supercruise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=94">00:01:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">actually can't do it. Supercruise can't do it because they're they're not good enough with roll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=98">00:01:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">on the road. Autopilot can do it and we can do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=106">00:01:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">How's San Diego in terms of quality of roads and lane markings and all that kind of stuff?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=110">00:01:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Pretty mediocre like the rest of California. What's your favorite uh reason for using KAMA?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=118">00:01:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Like when when do you find the most joy? Oh oh it's it's long trips. It's um you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=127">00:02:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">driving from here to LA. You'll do it without a disengagement almost. You can you can you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=133">00:02:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it's two hours to LA from here. You could just go to LA. Uh get in your car and you just sit there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=140">00:02:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and watch. And it's it's a it's a great time. All right so we can we can engage here. So you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=147">00:02:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">watch. So it doesn't technically require perfect lane markings? No not at all. In fact you can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=157">00:02:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">lane changes on roads that don't have lane markings because it's all end to end. So I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=163">00:02:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to get over three lanes. I'm just going to take control here to do it. Especially since there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=167">00:02:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a cop there. So let me just get over three lanes and then this road's a decent demo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=175">00:02:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah so I think only us and Autopilot can do this road.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=180">00:03:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Pretty curvy. Yeah and uh it's not just curvy it's also banked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=186">00:03:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um and if you don't yeah if you don't do that well if you don't have a model that can detect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=193">00:03:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that. Um so the longitudinal policy is actually just being done by the car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=198">00:03:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Um Hyundai has quite a competent ACC. Probably the best one. Uh so we haven't really felt the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=204">00:03:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">urge to move to our gas and brakes. There's a few cute things where which ours will do better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=209">00:03:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and more holistically than than theirs. But um really it's about the turning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=218">00:03:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How hard is it to get it to be this smooth? Uh hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=222">00:03:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Five years of engineering.

We have competent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=263">00:04:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">longitudinal using old school policies. But lateral there's so much subtlety. For example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=268">00:04:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">like when a lane splits out should you follow that split? Should you stay in the center or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=273">00:04:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">should you stay to one side or so much subtlety there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=276">00:04:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And making it all smooth and not freak out. Yeah and this thing you know the reason I feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=285">00:04:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">very confident keeping my hands off the wheel our torque limit is so much lower than Tesla's.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=289">00:04:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can't can't do anything crazy? No we do injection tests where one person sits in that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=296">00:04:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">seat with a joystick and the other person keeps their hands off the wheel and that person you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=300">00:05:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">can't look at them they're free to jam the joystick in any direction and if you don't feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=304">00:05:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you know safe in that maneuver they take back over here because we're getting off here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=307">00:05:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah that stretch of road is a is a is a competent demonstration of open pilot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=314">00:05:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah that was impressive. It's not the high end. Maybe when we get to the city streets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=319">00:05:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll engage on the city streets. Is city streets like a compelling use case or is that just kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=325">00:05:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">without it? Intuition builder. Without end-to-end longitudinal it's pretty like it's not really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=332">00:05:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">useful as product. So it's more just it's cool that it can do it and like we don't gate it off</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=338">00:05:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but most of open pilot is highways like most of the value real gain is highways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=344">00:05:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But also not just highways also like one lane each way kind of things like double yellow kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=353">00:05:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of roads. I was doing all like the mountains up in Colorado with this thing and just you get to look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=358">00:05:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">at the mountains before it drives. So like I can engage it here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=364">00:06:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now remember the longitudinal policy is is Hyundai and it's not ideal for cities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=374">00:06:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But so again we're going to go through this intersection with no lines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=383">00:06:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">See notice how there's no line there yet our placement is still almost human ideal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=388">00:06:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah this is great. So there I mean there you see we did a stretch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=393">00:06:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you know a minute of city and perfectly human nothing sketchy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=397">00:06:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">See places like that or where disengage on gas is really nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=402">00:06:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Really easy to you know hand off you always know when that handoff is happening with the noise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lks97-GLElk&t=411">00:06:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It didn't like keep the ACC on or anything.
