And then all of a sudden, they've got a thousand things on their list. How do they start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to think about, "Where should I take this next trip?"

Olympics. I've always wanted to go to a major</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">sporting event.

And maybe you look at Japan and you say, "Oh, I've always wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to go to a cultural place with history and a deep connection to self," right? You circle those words</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and you say, "Okay.

And so that's what decides you on this one. It doesn't mean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to get rid of Japan altogether or say that any destination that would be introspective</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">or slow isn't exciting for you.

Also, it's interesting to see as you gather all these destinations and you get all this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">inspiration, what is it that really does motivate you to travel and why, right?

And what does that mean for you? What's alive in you, right? When we plan</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">trips for people, there are so many different levers or so many different reasons people are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">going to different destinations.

So, let's say someone's done some thinking about what kind of trip they want. They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">say, "I want a little bit of culture, but I want to do it a little bit slower.

So, I don't want it to be too high-paced." Lots of places out there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe they haven't set up this inspiration for years. Where can they go to start to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">inspiration and how do they narrow the list down?

So, the first thing is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">talk to your friends.

But if not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe you want to be a little bit wary because you might be reading someone's experience,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe they were paid to go there, maybe there's something else happening on the back end that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't know about, and it might be tainting your kind of perspective trip.

So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">one, I really like the New York Times 52 places list.

I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">"Can you give me the average highs and lows for these cities in this month?" Or, "What is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">percent chance of rain in this month?" But still, we have this trip to Europe planned in the summer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and we have no actual agenda. We just have flights. We'll get to that right after this about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">when the trip finds you. I said, "Where could we go that doesn't get warmer than 85?" We don't want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to go somewhere where it's 90s in the summer. Humid and you're suffering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. It might be fun for kids. And they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">came up with all these destinations. And then I was like, "What about Portugal?" And they're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, that would be a great idea." But it's not a human. So I'm like, "Why did you put it on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">list?" And they're like, "Oh, sorry. I'll add it now." And so sometimes I've found myself just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">asking after every response, "Are there any places you forgot about?" And unfortunately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">90% of the time, it's like, "Well, yeah, here are three more." So you're right. You can't trust it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">However, I go back to people I know that don't fall into this optimizer's curse, which I do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and maybe you do a little bit less, which is they're like, "Oh, we want to take a trip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1098" target="_blank">00:18:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's just go to Italy." They don't try to pick the best trip. And so I like timeboxing this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's something that we're working on. And I won't say we do a perfect job at it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">but the idea being, "Okay, we're going to take a trip. And this week, we're going to figure out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">where we're going." And you know what? We have a lot of years and a lot of trips ahead of us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1117" target="_blank">00:18:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But this one doesn't have to be the only one. And a friend of mine actually took a trip to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, Australia. And they'd always said, "We can't go to Australia because we need two weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We need two weeks." And then finally, they're like, "Well, we have one week." They found a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1127" target="_blank">00:18:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">deal. They went. And they're like, "Yo, we can always go back if we need two weeks."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Totally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so every trip will be great if you aren't too stressed out planning it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Agreed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think sometimes we fall into that boat. In many cases, this trip is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">because I think kids add this X factor where one day, your kids are super well-behaved,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1148" target="_blank">00:19:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and you're like, "You know what? We should take them on this trip." And then the next day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1150" target="_blank">00:19:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you're like, "The kids are monsters." And you're like, "Are we biting off too much?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1155" target="_blank">00:19:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So if the trip found you, and you know where you're going because you've got these great flight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1160" target="_blank">00:19:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">deals, or if you've used one of these flight discovery tools we talked about to find this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1164" target="_blank">00:19:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">amazing idea, that's one case. The other case is you've decided where you're going,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and you need to book the flight. And at the end of both of those scenarios,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1172" target="_blank">00:19:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we're ready to start planning. So any quick tips on the, "I know where I want to go. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1177" target="_blank">00:19:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">being intentional.

Flights</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1181" target="_blank">00:19:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">for my trip that I've decided is in Italy or is somewhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1184" target="_blank">00:19:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Or sometimes there's a connection where maybe they'll have... In your connecting flight,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">they'll change the flight times.

And what you can do is sign</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1199" target="_blank">00:19:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">up for alerts from the airline to make sure that they notify you for every change that happens to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1204" target="_blank">00:20:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">your flight. But also you can use monitoring tools that are out there. TripIt has some of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1208" target="_blank">00:20:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Other tools have these automatic monitoring to make sure that you're getting the right flights</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and that changes don't occur. In terms of how else to book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I would always keep an eye on optimizing your flights to see if maybe the price you've paid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1222" target="_blank">00:20:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">does drop. With points and miles in particular, you can usually get a rebate back of whatever the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1227" target="_blank">00:20:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">flight difference is. You were very lucky this summer. I think you've booked flights for 45,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1231" target="_blank">00:20:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">miles per person. That's incredible. You're probably not going to optimize around that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1235" target="_blank">00:20:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you'd booked them for 120,000 and maybe flights on the same day had dropped to 45,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you'd be getting that huge chunk of miles back. So you do want to keep searching or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">keep monitoring automatically with tools to see if there's an advantage to take there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1248" target="_blank">00:20:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And sometimes the same thing's true with fares. So TripIt's great as a monitoring tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It'll say, "Hey, the flight you booked has gone down in price.

And we'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">talk a little bit about organizing everything on a trip as we go. Any advice? This is a question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1272" target="_blank">00:21:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">from a listener who said, "When I'm planning these big trips, how do I think about layovers?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1278" target="_blank">00:21:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And do I think about them differently than if I'm flying domestically and I have a sense of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1282" target="_blank">00:21:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">how travel works?" Yeah, that's a great question. So generally speaking, when you're flying from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1286" target="_blank">00:21:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the States to Europe or to Asia, you're flying on the first segment on a very long-haul flight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to a hub in that continent. And then from there, you're going to connect onwards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So what's nice about landing in a hub is that if, God forbid, you did miss your connection because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1300" target="_blank">00:21:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">your inbound flight was delayed, generally speaking, from hub to endpoint, there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1304" target="_blank">00:21:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">other flights that are out there. Awesome. What you may want to do when you've booked your flight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is just double-check, okay, what would be the next flight if, for some reason, we were delayed by an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1314" target="_blank">00:21:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">hour and a half, we miss our two-hour connection, right? What's the next flight from Frankfurt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1319" target="_blank">00:21:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">onwards to Vienna, right? And then you can kind of have a sense for how many more flights there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">are that day or if you're going to end up sleeping in the Frankfurt airport that night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1327" target="_blank">00:22:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, what I always like to do whenever I go into Europe or Asia, for this matter, is I like to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1332" target="_blank">00:22:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">at least a two-hour layover. Why two hours? Because you're going to end up most likely having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1337" target="_blank">00:22:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">a clear immigration and you'll have probably to go through security again. Most European airports,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1343" target="_blank">00:22:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of Asian ones too, require another layer of security. And that's security without pre,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">without clear, whatever you're used to in an American security system, out the window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Out the window. So get used to that. And also, you're going to be groggy. You may not have slept</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1358" target="_blank">00:22:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the last 10 hours. Your kids might be super grumpy. It's a bit of an experience.

On the flip side, maybe you do want to pack in a really long layover. Maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to spend eight hours in the Frankfurt area, not necessarily airport. What I would do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in that case is leave my bags at the airport.

And so I would highly recommend that if you do have longer than let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1409" target="_blank">00:23:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">say a four or five hour layover, take a look at what's in that area. Can you get into that town?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you go explore before coming back to the airport and connecting onwards?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1417" target="_blank">00:23:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing you can do too if you have the budget for it and it's of interest is get a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">greeter. Oftentimes there are connection greeters. Amsterdam Schiphol airport, great example of this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1426" target="_blank">00:23:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it's only like 160 bucks to get a greeter.

So whatever you can do to make those layovers count,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1451" target="_blank">00:24:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I would do it, but I wouldn't just disregard them.

Taking that and applying it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1796" target="_blank">00:29:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to an actual real trip, we like to build a scaffolding for people. They have their flight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1800" target="_blank">00:30:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in, their flight out. We know what their big purpose of going on this trip is. It's relaxation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1806" target="_blank">00:30:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it's seeing the sights, it's eating these meals, it's going to a Taylor Swift concert.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1810" target="_blank">00:30:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we put that centerpiece, that capstone somewhere in that trip. Everything else around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1815" target="_blank">00:30:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that, we ask a few questions. How much activity and motion do you want to have? How many different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1822" target="_blank">00:30:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">things each day do you want to be doing? If you had to cut all of this out and just focus on one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1829" target="_blank">00:30:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">thing, what's the thing that matters the most? So as you look at this trip scaffolding and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1833" target="_blank">00:30:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">figure out the amount of activity and the motion that you want to have, you then can start to slot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1839" target="_blank">00:30:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in, "Okay, well, maybe I've been to Paris before. I've spent five days there in the past. Maybe I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1844" target="_blank">00:30:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">just need three days this time. And I'm okay splitting it up to do two days upon arrival</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1848" target="_blank">00:30:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and one day before departure so that I can get my bearings set when I land and I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1854" target="_blank">00:30:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">feel back into Paris. But then as soon as I'm set, I can scoot off and go somewhere else,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1860" target="_blank">00:31:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">do the thing I want to do, come back to Paris the night before my flight to make sure that I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1865" target="_blank">00:31:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be freaking out about a 9 a.m. departure from Paris when I'm still two hours outside of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">town on the last day." So maybe that's the way that you feel like the motion and the movement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1874" target="_blank">00:31:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">could be right. But I like to have people draw this out on a piece of paper. "These are the days</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1879" target="_blank">00:31:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm in town. These are what I'm doing. This is the amount of motion. Does this feel right?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1883" target="_blank">00:31:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And ask themselves those questions. "Hey, I'm going to be spending three hours on the train</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1887" target="_blank">00:31:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this day.

That's a lot in one day. Maybe we chunk that out and now instead of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1898" target="_blank">00:31:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">spending two days in town, you're spending three because the next day you'll go to the museum and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1903" target="_blank">00:31:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the final night you're there, you'll do the big Michelin star meal. So when people can see things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1909" target="_blank">00:31:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">visually, I think it really helps them. Adding things to a digital calendar, very important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1913" target="_blank">00:31:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Putting it on a spreadsheet, day by day, breakfast, lunch, dinner, what are my activities,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1917" target="_blank">00:31:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">where am I going, super helpful. But scaffolding it out so that people know how much motion and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1924" target="_blank">00:32:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">activity, that matters the most. Yeah, when we look at itineraries, we do something similar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1929" target="_blank">00:32:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think you often forget how much packing and traveling adds to the day. So you might be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1936" target="_blank">00:32:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking, "Oh, we're just going from Paris to London. It's a short train ride." But that whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1941" target="_blank">00:32:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">day is probably pretty close to written off because you wake up and you're like, "Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1944" target="_blank">00:32:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">now I want to make sure I'm all packed." And maybe this is different if you're a solo traveler and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1949" target="_blank">00:32:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you just have a backpack. But when we have two kids, that day's gone. And so I try to make sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1956" target="_blank">00:32:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we're in each place for at least three nights. Because otherwise, as soon as you get there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1961" target="_blank">00:32:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you're starting to think about, "Now we got to go to this next place." And depending on the density</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1967" target="_blank">00:32:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of a destination, or how easy transportation is, might dictate whether you're taking on too much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1975" target="_blank">00:32:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">or not. In a place like Japan, where you could hop on a train and be somewhere. Or Europe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1979" target="_blank">00:32:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">within a country, that's often true. Great. In a place where you've got to drive an hour to get to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1984" target="_blank">00:33:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">an airport, and then land, and then drive another. It could just feel like two destinations in two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1990" target="_blank">00:33:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">weeks is the max. Yeah. And honestly, if you're in Paris, it doesn't mean you can't take a day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=1998" target="_blank">00:33:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">trip up to Normandy while you're there, right?

Does that apply everywhere else in the world? Or are there places where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=2127" target="_blank">00:35:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">looking for a place to stay isn't as simple as going to booking.com, Google hotel search?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=2133" target="_blank">00:35:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure. I think when you look at the big booking engines like booking.com, Expedia, Airbnb,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=2140" target="_blank">00:35:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">others, hotels.com, they've done a great job of trying to gobble up most of the available</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=2144" target="_blank">00:35:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">inventory that's out there for rent in private homes, apartments, etc. throughout these cities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=2151" target="_blank">00:35:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you're looking online on those sites, you're probably going to find most of what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=2156" target="_blank">00:35:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">out there.

Oftentimes, I've found that if I actually find a suitable accommodation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=2166" target="_blank">00:36:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and I either Google the name of that accommodation and do a reverse image search to find if they have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=2172" target="_blank">00:36:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">got their own website for that villa or that apartment, or if they're managed by an apartment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=2177" target="_blank">00:36:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">rental company, if I can find that rental company, or even find sometimes that the hotels themselves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=2182" target="_blank">00:36:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">are directly bookable and they're cheaper.

And then the other one's a similar deal. And now you're like looking at the nuance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=2340" target="_blank">00:39:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of, "Oh, what kind of soap do they use in the shower?" Or like, "What hours is the breakfast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=2344" target="_blank">00:39:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">open?"

Viator is great because if you can think of a tour,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=2820" target="_blank">00:47:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Viator probably has it in that city.

If you're totally blue sky and new to a city and you're trying to plan it out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=2833" target="_blank">00:47:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I like to look at context tours. They're an amazingly sort of higher range, both</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=2840" target="_blank">00:47:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">private as well as small group tour. And they tend to have the sort of more specialist tours</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=2848" target="_blank">00:47:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in each town.

Or it might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=2865" target="_blank">00:47:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">be not that exciting to you and you're like, well, I want to do everything that doesn't include that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=2868" target="_blank">00:47:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">piece, right? And you don't have to book a context tour. At all. But use them as a good curated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=2874" target="_blank">00:47:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">tour site. Correct. Correct. And I would say on the whole, we've never had a client book a context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=2881" target="_blank">00:48:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">tour and be like, "Oh, this is terrible."

Take it with a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3414" target="_blank">00:56:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">grain of salt. It may not be you, right? He might've said, "Oh, but watch shopping and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3418" target="_blank">00:56:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">not into watches." That's fine. Filter it. But definitely start with somebody who is on-the-ground</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3425" target="_blank">00:57:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">or close to. And nowadays, there are travel content people who are beyond just kind of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3431" target="_blank">00:57:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Instagram video stuff. And so when I did an episode on London with Jess Dante, she runs this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3438" target="_blank">00:57:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Love in London blog.

I don't know the directory of all of those people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3451" target="_blank">00:57:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">but I imagine in almost every city in the world, major cities at least, there's someone who has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3456" target="_blank">00:57:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">some content that you could book. And I imagine if you booked that through their site and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3462" target="_blank">00:57:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">emailed them with some questions, they would probably answer them. Oh, in a heartbeat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3465" target="_blank">00:57:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">If you don't have a hotel concierge or you booked an Airbnb, but it's really through a property</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3469" target="_blank">00:57:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">management company run in another city, I would look for that or I would go on the free walking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3474" target="_blank">00:57:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">tour, ask the local there or walk into a restaurant or a bar on the first day and ask someone working</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3481" target="_blank">00:58:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">there. One thing Amy and I realized was we just don't love going to art and history museums. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3488" target="_blank">00:58:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">if we do, it's like one in a trip. And so there are cities that we've been to where we ask people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3494" target="_blank">00:58:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">what to do. And we look at the guidebooks and they would say, "If you're there for a week,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3499" target="_blank">00:58:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">spend three or four days going to museums. Or if you're in Cambodia, go to Angkor Wat, but go for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3504" target="_blank">00:58:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">four days. Get the four-day pass." And we loved going to Angkor Wat for a day. But at the end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3510" target="_blank">00:58:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of the day, I was sure that we didn't wanna go for three more. It just wasn't our type of travel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3515" target="_blank">00:58:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We'd much rather go get lost and eat food in some local village. And so don't let the guidebook,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3522" target="_blank">00:58:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the recommendations influence you to do something that you know isn't what you want. So those notes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3529" target="_blank">00:58:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you like to take after a trip, keep those in mind. Well, to add to that, Chris, if you go,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3534" target="_blank">00:58:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you build three days in your itinerary of museums each day. And on day one, you're like, "I'm pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3539" target="_blank">00:58:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">museumed out." Great. You don't have to go to day two and three if you don't want to. You can have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3543" target="_blank">00:59:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that flexibility built into your itinerary that you can just take a left turn here and decide to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3547" target="_blank">00:59:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">do something totally different and be okay with that.

It's all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3551" target="_blank">00:59:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">about the flexibility of building your trip the way you want it to be, but also not feeling like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3555" target="_blank">00:59:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you're stuck in that trip that you have to check every single box on that itinerary. If after day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3560" target="_blank">00:59:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">one, you're over museums, write down on your itinerary, "Pretty done with museums." And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3566" target="_blank">00:59:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">now what you know in the future, when you come back to look at that trip review, "Okay, I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3570" target="_blank">00:59:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to book way fewer museums in the future because this was enough for me." Yeah. Love that. So I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3575" target="_blank">00:59:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">think we've covered a lot of the things that you need to do. We talked about itinerary management.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3580" target="_blank">00:59:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So now you've got this whole trip put together.

I love to copy that and make sure it's on my calendar. One key note here is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3601" target="_blank">01:00:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that if you're using a Google Gmail address and you're using Google Calendar, you may get these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3607" target="_blank">01:00:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">automatic updates to your calendar where Google's like, "Oh, we noticed you've got a train ticket,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3611" target="_blank">01:00:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and they'll plop it into your calendar.

Just double check that those times are actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3616" target="_blank">01:00:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">correct.

That's great. But definitely put things on the spreadsheet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3637" target="_blank">01:00:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">put things on the calendar, and then go back and take a look at what are you referencing from your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3642" target="_blank">01:00:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">original trip planning, ideation, dreaming, visioning, to what is actually happening,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3649" target="_blank">01:00:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and are you living the trip of your dreams?

Nothing's wrong,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3663" target="_blank">01:01:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's interesting to look at what you're dreaming of and what actually you've planned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3667" target="_blank">01:01:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then post-trip, I like to go back and kind of figure out, "Okay, well, what worked and what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3671" target="_blank">01:01:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't and why?" And use that same organization, make notes on, "Okay, this transfer time was too</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3676" target="_blank">01:01:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">short.

And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=3740" target="_blank">01:02:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">having some place where you're like, "This is the hotel we're staying at.

I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=4067" target="_blank">01:07:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">would do a different level of diligence on those kinds of companies. But it's very important to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=4072" target="_blank">01:07:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">understand what you can expect to get back out of insurance and why you're buying it to begin with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=4076" target="_blank">01:07:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">before you start.

So another thing that I recommend to people is about a week before each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=4103" target="_blank">01:08:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">trip, I sit down with my spouse and we go through each of the trip elements that we have coming up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=4108" target="_blank">01:08:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We make sure that obviously all of our passports haven't changed from what we thought. They have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=4112" target="_blank">01:08:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the right expiration dates and we have the right visas if we need them. Sometimes when you're doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=4117" target="_blank">01:08:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a visa on arrival, by the way, they're either going to be requiring you paying local currency,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=4121" target="_blank">01:08:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">which can be tricky if you haven't exchanged money ahead of time, or they're going to give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=4125" target="_blank">01:08:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you a usurious rate at the airport to exchange to be able to do that.

Again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSwg6Z9JfA&t=4136" target="_blank">01:08:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">crisp, clean, newer US dollars.
