It's kind of a surprise. This morning I got on the plane to fly up to Seattle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was going to do a pod with Satya, as you know, and that we were going to do our reaction pod.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And a typhoon or something hit Seattle last night, literally like halfway up there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I got word that Microsoft has no power. Nobody has any power. Trees are down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I did a U-turn and wished them well. I'm going to go back up there on Monday and do a pod with Satya.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But given that, I couldn't wait to get together with you and kick around all the things that we've been sharing back and forth over the last couple of weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Lots of stuff happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No doubt about it. One of the things certainly popular in our threads has been AI scaling laws.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, like, are we beginning to see models top out, particularly on pre-training?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, there was this Bloomberg headline, "OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic struggle to build more advanced AI."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It then goes on to say that Orion or Chat GPT-5, Gemini, and 3.5 Opus are all falling short of internal pre-training targets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they quoted Dario as saying, "Scaling laws are not actually laws of the universe, but they are simply empirical regularities."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, "I'm going to be in favor of them continuing, but I'm not certain of that."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what's been on your mind about whether or not we are, in fact, seeing continued gains from pre-training?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would add a few other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Ilya was also quoted as questioning whether the scaling laws were continued.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And for whatever reason, Mark and Ben over at Dendres and Horowitz also made the same statement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in a very short window, we got this point of view from quite a few number of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would add that in Dario's five-hour interview with Lex, which I only grabbed pieces of from the transcript,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but he was very positive on scaling laws in that interview, which just recently dropped.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there may be a disagreement between some people, but the breadth of the feedback suggests something's up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think something's worth paying attention to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would add that there were people that raised this question early on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it's specific to LLMs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think you should say AI scaling laws.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there was always a question about whether LLMs would run out of steam.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was tied to three different things, which you and I talked about on July 11th.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I had even raised this question a year ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One is, will the parameter count run out?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Historically, mathematical algorithms that do some type of fit, and this is a very sophisticated form of that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but when you take the variables up to a certain level, it stops adding value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You just get too close to the fit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a question about how big the context window will be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that came up on the NVIDIA call today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we can talk about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then data was brought up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of people, I know this was a big point Melanie Mitchell had raised, like, are we just going to run out of data?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there was pushback that there's synthetic data, but there's been papers published that show synthetic data creates a lot of chaos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I do think there were people that were thinking this might happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there was also a belief, and I share this belief, you don't have to, so we can disagree on this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that there was a argument being made by, you know, OpenAI and Anthropic that, oh, you're just going to see the next number drop,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and the next number is going to be way better than the last number, and that's going to happen routinely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they both said, you know, we spent whatever, a billion on this model, and we're going to spend 10, and then we're going to spend 100.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that implies, I would say, at least linear scaling or maybe above.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they all said that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if the comment, you know, that you read earlier is true and that they're not getting the benefit, there are implications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it doesn't mean AI is in trouble or AI is done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's tons of positive AI news out there, but it may mean we're shifting directions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's worth, I think, talking about, well, if this is true, what are the implications?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right, no doubt about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, and Jensen did just say on the NVIDIA call, he basically said there is no slowdown,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but he did say that foundation model pre-training is only one vector of scaling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=371"

at in the early phases over the last 24 months,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.000</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:06:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I think a lot of people mistakenly, and we'll get to this later,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of people mistakenly said if the pre-training ever slows down, this is horrible for NVIDIA,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because the only reason NVIDIA is going up is because people are buying these big clusters to do pre-training,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which also isn't entirely true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I do think it's important to recognize, right, that as you scale up pre-training,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of the low-hanging fruit was plucked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it makes sense to me that you're seeing a deceleration in the rate of improvement of the pre-training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But when you look in the aggregate at all these various vectors on which we're scaling intelligence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">on a combinatorial basis, it may be just as good or even better.</span></div><div

steel man the argument.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's assume that we do, you know, kind of run out of improvements or see a significant deceleration</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=451"

I'm not asking you to agree with this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it's just like what's in my head, is that this is not the expectation that Sam and Dario had 12 months ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like because they were promoting a thesis that it was just going to keep going up and up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and they were willing to put 10x over and over again on the size of the cluster they were going to train on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it's a shift, and it may very well be a shift that leads to insane innovation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and continued growth, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I still think it's a surprise shift.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I don't think it was what was expected.</span></div><div

happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Two other things that I think are, let's just call them questions that are raised.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One, the NVIDIA differentiation, as we've talked about, is greatest at the largest cluster size.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if pre-training, once again I only equate this to LLMs, you know, I don't think of FSD problem,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that that is more of a core AI problem, and that thing may scale way beyond where it is today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But for LLMs at least, if we've hit a cap, then, you know, does that impact NVIDIA demand at all for the bigger systems?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's a differentiation question, which is if the world shifts to inference sooner or faster,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and if the path of differentiation for the language model companies becomes more inference-based than pre-training-based,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what does that mean for the hardware systems that people are using?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, and then the third thing, and I'll go quick and you can respond, is, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">might a ceiling on that pre-training allow other people to catch up faster with open AI?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there was an article out today about a, like, pseudo-Chinese model that was performing at or near some of the latest--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Deep-seek.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Deep-seek, I think is what you're referring to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So anyway, those would be the three things that I would say that you would want to analyze if you thought that was true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We've spent a lot of time talking with, for example, the CEOs of most of the hyperscalers, if not all of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I listened to Jensen on the call today, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They called Hopper Demand exceptional, and this is the very tail end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We may have-- people thought Hopper Demand would be over by now, frankly, and he said it's going to continue well into next year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And interesting, they called Blackwell Demand staggering and said that, you know, they're increasing the production even against their prior predictions, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They beat the quarter in terms of revenue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the action on the street seems to support Jensen's words on the call, which is there's no slowdown, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sam tweeted, I think there is no wall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there is a debate here, and some of it may be semantics, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I definitely think the second derivative is slowing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you're still seeing gains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the implication we've hit a wall suggests no gains and that there are no different vectors of scaling that intelligence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think at least as we look at 2025 for NVIDIA, for the supply chain, and for the model companies themselves, we think we're going to continue to see improvements in the models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It won't all come from pre-training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We think there's an increasing amount coming from post-training, from data quality, and then obviously from this inference time reasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would add to what you said. I mean, I listened to the call. Yeah, there was certainly no concern raised by Jensen about either his demand or his sense of what was going on at the architectural level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Microsoft has been increasingly boisterous as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If this thing is true, it certainly goes against what Kevin Scott was saying on a podcast four or five months ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I doubt that even if it were true that it would play out in the numbers as fast as we're talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This stuff just came out like weeks ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I wouldn't ignore it. I think it's important to understand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's important to know what the drivers are of incremental investment and incremental use and incremental performance and competitiveness and to see where that's going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think there are a lot of questions that we need to ask and understand about inference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Do models that are, as I understand it from the startups that we work with, you can train a model on a big NVIDIA cluster and you can run it on a different system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are certainly performance tests that are in the public that show the Groxon, Cerebris, and other TPUs, including the ones at Google, outperforming on inference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, on the call, Jensen said something that I hadn't heard him say before, which is he talked about context windows potentially growing really large.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that might then require a larger cluster, which might bring a point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Prior on the previous call, Jensen had just said, well, the reason you'll use us for inference is because you've got old machines laying around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This was a step in a different direction saying, well, if context windows are huge, we might be differentiated yet again here with larger systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think those are the things that people need to ask and figure out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no doubt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one of the implications of what you're saying is as we looked at pre-training, we basically watched what appeared to be the increasing commoditization of the pre-training advantage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Everybody was catching up pretty quickly, even people who we didn't think were necessarily in the lead pack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if, in fact, we're seeing a deceleration in the rate of improvement, if that's becoming more commodity, then it shifts the balance of power to post-training, which really relies on quality of data and other vectors of scaling intelligence like inference time reasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And those things may be less commodity either because you have a data flywheel that's better than your competitors or because you've just had some breakthroughs architecturally on other ways to scale intelligence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think 2025 is going to cast more light on those things as well as improvements into the core product like we've talked about before around memory and actions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there was a lot of talk on memory in the past week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So both Google, Jim, and I released a model of their chatbot that has memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Mustafa at Microsoft dropped the phrase "near infinite memory."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=889" target="_blank">00:14:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, putting "near" next to the word "infinite" I think is a bit of an oxymoron.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You could say I'm going to live near forever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not sure what that means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Clever use of clever words of semantics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But they seem super excited about what they've unlocked in memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.000</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There was talk prior to now, or if you assume that weren't true, that these companies were just going to train on bigger and bigger and bigger systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=948"

target="_blank">00:16:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not worried about it from the perspective of NVIDIA because I think, again, while we're all hyper-focused on these evals, right, the real world people are focused on use cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.000</a></span> | <span

inference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We know NVIDIA has said

let's talk about this vector around consumer AI, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.000</a></span>

we think these agents are going to become infinitely more useful to us when we don't have to prompt them about all the things we've done in the past.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've also seen everybody begin to roll out actions.</span></div><div

it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We saw computer use out of

recently that tools and agents that can do things like book airline tickets are at least as important as better models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We will have better and better models, but I think the next giant breakthrough will be with agents and their actions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that these, again, they're not either/or, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The core models will get more capable, multi-modality, inference time reasoning, post-training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I also think we finally see out of these companies a real cadence around product improvements, memory, actions, voice, voice, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That just dramatically increase the utility of these things, which then leads to massive increase in token production or inference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1128" target="_blank">00:18:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that inference has got to run somewhere, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that doesn't-- and then when I look at ChatGPT, you could see the numbers that are out there publicly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.000</a></span> | <span

| <span class="t">In fact, if anything, accelerating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think those are indicators, right, because I've heard that Claude and other models are doing-- Perplexity are doing well as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1150" target="_blank">00:19:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think those are indicators on the consumer side, right, that consumers are finding more and more utility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1156" target="_blank">00:19:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think 25 with these product improvements, I think that could be another step function unlock in terms of consumer use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1164" target="_blank">00:19:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And enterprise use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, all those things, memory, voice, they can be utilized in an enterprise fashion for sure and will be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1177" target="_blank">00:19:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, yeah, I think you're right about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1181" target="_blank">00:19:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think those innovations will matter for the exact same reason you said, which is utility will go up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think Snowflake said on their call tonight, 3,200 of their customers, so they have about 10,000 enterprise customers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1195" target="_blank">00:19:55.000</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:20:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, starting to see some of that indication, I noted that Microsoft, which is on a $66 billion run rate at Azure,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1211" target="_blank">00:20:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">has said they expect Q1 and Q2 Azure revenue to accelerate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Think about that, Bill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Azure is growing at 34% on a $66 billion base, and they say they expect it to accelerate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1225" target="_blank">00:20:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's really significant growth on big software businesses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1229" target="_blank">00:20:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think what we've seen in the season is that software certainly has not decelerated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1236" target="_blank">00:20:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If anything, it's accelerated after a couple years of digestion, I think, around this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1241" target="_blank">00:20:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, if I had one takeaway having watched all of this, I would agree with you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1248" target="_blank">00:20:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you've been, you know, rattling my cage about this for a year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think you've been proven at least partially right that we're seeing a deceleration in the rate of improvement on pre-training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1260" target="_blank">00:21:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But my conclusion is I don't think it necessarily matters to the consumption on the NVIDIA side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Certainly it would be higher, it could be even more, I suppose, if they were able to produce that many more, which I don't think they can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think that they're, you know, still in a very strong position.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1278" target="_blank">00:21:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think these models, I think, you know, for example, OpenAI could double, triple the number of users of ChatGPT with, frankly, not making any improvements in the core model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because consumers today barely scratch the surface on core model capabilities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1294" target="_blank">00:21:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Product improvements like voice, memory, and actions, I think, in and of themselves could drive tremendous traction and revenue increases in that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I do think they'll still continue to see some of those model improvements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1307" target="_blank">00:21:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe one area that I know that we've actually seen a tremendous return, I think, on the investment made in AI, and we saw some news this week, is on national full self-driving regulation, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1323" target="_blank">00:22:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the Trump administration announced that they want the DOT to develop a national framework to regulate self-driving rather than the state-by-state framework, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1333" target="_blank">00:22:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So most states, I think, require certain licensure to be able to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Texas and Florida have no

indications out of the administration were that they wanted a national policy, which makes sense to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1347" target="_blank">00:22:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's very beneficial to Tesla and to Waymo and to anybody else who's in the full self-driving game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1353" target="_blank">00:22:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You get to

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1443" target="_blank">00:24:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">By the middle of this year, when they released 12.5, it showed 100x improvement in miles per critical disengagement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1452" target="_blank">00:24:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then with the launch of FSD 13 in the next couple of weeks, we expect another 10x improvement in terms of that MPCI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But here was the crazy stat for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're already at 1000x better than we were at the start of this year in terms of miles per critical engagement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1472" target="_blank">00:24:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if you do some back of the envelope, which she did in her tweet, and Elon retweeted it, at launch in Q4 of this year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1481" target="_blank">00:24:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it looks like version 13 will be somewhere around 25,000 miles per critical disengagement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we estimate that Waymo is right around that same level, maybe 20,000 miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1490" target="_blank">00:24:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're already caught up, we think, with Waymo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1494" target="_blank">00:24:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the current rate of improvement, in Q1 of next year, they could be at 100,000 miles per critical disengagement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">By the middle of next year, 500,000 miles per critical disengagement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1507" target="_blank">00:25:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, just to put this in perspective, there's a human accident every 500,000 miles that's self-reported with human drivers.</span></div><div

self-driving bill, where we started seeing Waymos on every street corner in San Francisco,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where you and I had our, you know, and Michael Dell tweeted about it, our Tesla FSD 12.3 moment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1533" target="_blank">00:25:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">then if this was the chat GPT year, I think next year really is the year of achievement of a safety standard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1542" target="_blank">00:25:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that allows RoboTaxi to go into action, probably in Q2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1547" target="_blank">00:25:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They'll pick a couple cities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1549" target="_blank">00:25:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that doesn't mean that you can pull the steering wheel out of every Tesla,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1554" target="_blank">00:25:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because, you know, Elon has said we're not there yet from a safety perspective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1559" target="_blank">00:25:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the way they'll do it for a RoboTaxi is you can put the car on RoboTaxi mode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1567" target="_blank">00:26:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So think about it this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If I'm driving down Sand Hill

right, a different safety standard, if you will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1598" target="_blank">00:26:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that's how they get safe enough in a couple markets to be able to drive RoboTaxi,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1603" target="_blank">00:26:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is to just put it in a safer driving mode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1607" target="_blank">00:26:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, and I've watched these cars do it.</span></div><div

that they're on already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1613" target="_blank">00:26:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that for me was paying attention to that regulation combined with the improvements in FSD-13.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1621" target="_blank">00:27:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's going to be big news as we look forward at 2025.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1626" target="_blank">00:27:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a couple things I would respond to that I think are going to have to play out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1632" target="_blank">00:27:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, as of now, Tesla hasn't had cars driving around without drivers picking up people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1638" target="_blank">00:27:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Waymo's got years under their belt doing that, and there's going to be some learnings that come from that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1644" target="_blank">00:27:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There just are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they're going to -- I think I read that they're going to maybe start doing that in the next few months or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1653" target="_blank">00:27:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But in the states that are allowing Waymo, you have to apply, you have to get approval.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1659" target="_blank">00:27:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a step that they need to take.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1661" target="_blank">00:27:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think there's some natural learning that comes from that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1664" target="_blank">00:27:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you can hear how they talk about SpaceX, and there's a similar thing here, like until you get the cars out on the road.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1673" target="_blank">00:27:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Most people believe Waymo still has oversight from a data center somewhere where people are watching when engagements happen or disengagements happen so they can take over and pay attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1684" target="_blank">00:28:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so is that same infrastructure going to be built at Tesla?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1687" target="_blank">00:28:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1689" target="_blank">00:28:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That might be an important thing as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1693" target="_blank">00:28:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">To the national standard, I unquestionably think it can be helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1697" target="_blank">00:28:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There are states in this fine country of ours that like to override regardless of a national standard, most notably California.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1706" target="_blank">00:28:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that would -- but of course it would make more sense for this to be done nationally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1712" target="_blank">00:28:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that would be great if they stepped in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1715" target="_blank">00:28:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I had always been a big proponent of open source in this area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1718" target="_blank">00:28:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of stuff that could be beneficial from a safety standpoint if everyone were doing it the exact same way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1725" target="_blank">00:28:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I could even imagine a communication network, the status of a traffic light, for example, should -- there's no need for that to be inferred.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1735" target="_blank">00:28:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, we're going to use how much compute to look at the light and determine whether it's red or green.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1740" target="_blank">00:29:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a state machine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1742" target="_blank">00:29:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's either red or green, and that can be known.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1744" target="_blank">00:29:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you could, as you build these intelligent systems, start to have the state of different things, which could include, you know, road openings and road closures and, you know, construction work that's going on and traffic and all kind of other things that should be built into the system as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1765" target="_blank">00:29:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I do think that -- I do think a national kind of standard could be great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1769" target="_blank">00:29:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It could also be really bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1771" target="_blank">00:29:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, if you get overregulation and this massive, you know, stuff that -- and the incumbents might just use it to protect themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1779" target="_blank">00:29:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But my own belief is that it's -- you know, you've got Waymo, who's got the most cars running autonomously on the street right now, Tesla, who's got all the advantages you just talked about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1793" target="_blank">00:29:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You've got Uber, who's got this huge network of users.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1815" target="_blank">00:30:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, let's talk about that because I think that's an interesting question, you know, kind of a market structure question that I've been thinking a lot about lately, Bill, certainly on the public fund side of our business, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1830" target="_blank">00:30:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When I have a disruption of this magnitude in an industry that's a multitrillion-dollar industry that has, you know, 20, 30 different public players in the supply chain, OEMs, et cetera, like, I just start thinking, who are the winners and who are the losers here, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1845" target="_blank">00:30:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly how I was feeling in

the world is that all these OEMs, so I'm talking the U.S. OEMs, the Stellantis, the GMs, the Fords, the Europeans, the Volkswagens, the BMWs, the Mercedes, the Japanese, the Toyotas, et cetera, the Chinese, that FSD becomes a commodity and that they all end up with some version of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1905"

that as maybe like this Android version that they're all going to, this box they're going to plug in their cars, and they're all going to go compete, you know, as though they were before with

that Tesla could end up restructuring the entire industry, end up being tens of millions of cars. You may only have two or three or four global players, which, you know, we have in a lot of other industries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1958" target="_blank">00:32:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the question I have for you is, do you, you know, what is your pattern recognition?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1963" target="_blank">00:32:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you think that we're going to have all the same OEMs, they're all going to have some system, it's going to be basically commoditized?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1970" target="_blank">00:32:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or is this an extinction moment for some of these OEMs?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1975" target="_blank">00:32:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Such a hard question. I mean, there's so many different ways this could play out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1980" target="_blank">00:33:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the things that I question in my mind is who's going to own these vehicles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1986" target="_blank">00:33:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, on one hand, you have the Waymo situation where they own all the cars, but they also know what that means from a CapEx standpoint.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=1996" target="_blank">00:33:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you look at the subtleties of the kind of the statements they've made in conjunction with Uber, they're at least going to experiment with some models where maybe they don't have to pay for all the cars or licensing their technology to the other OEMs that we talked about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2013" target="_blank">00:33:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And people I've heard Dara talk about at Uber talk about, you know, maybe, you know, large, you know, debt companies get behind and own these things, like maybe the containers work in a rail yard, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2027" target="_blank">00:33:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like who owns these things? They move around, but someone owns them, right? People lease them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2033" target="_blank">00:33:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a big question, you know, and the Tesla argument is that they'll just be owned by the people that own the Tesla, which is great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2043" target="_blank">00:34:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Tesla doesn't have the CapEx burden, everybody else has, because they've talked them into buying these cars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2048" target="_blank">00:34:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But what percentage of people are going to lease out their car every day?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2052" target="_blank">00:34:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What would you guess?

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2063" target="_blank">00:34:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So where does it fall?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2066" target="_blank">00:34:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, you know, my own hunch on that is that it's going to be a higher percentage, particularly as the price points on the cars fall, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2075" target="_blank">00:34:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now they're leasing cars for, you know, 200 bucks a month, and as those subscription prices fall, I think you're going to have a whole category of people who don't mind at all, right, earning incremental revenues on their car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2087" target="_blank">00:34:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I imagine they've done internal survey work on this, and I think if you look at the places where, Bill, they're likely to launch the RoboTaxi, number one, it's going to be in marketplaces where they have sufficient safety, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2100" target="_blank">00:35:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So where they have a density of data that tells them they can put it in RoboTaxi mode and they won't have any problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2106" target="_blank">00:35:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that could be somewhere like maybe the Bay Area, somewhere like Austin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2110" target="_blank">00:35:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then secondly, it's going to be a market where they have a lot of Teslas sitting on the sidelines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2115" target="_blank">00:35:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they come seed it with 25 or 50 Teslas, but in both of these places, they happen to have Tesla factories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2121" target="_blank">00:35:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a lot of people with Teslas, and there are a lot of people who will drop them into the pool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2125" target="_blank">00:35:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So those will be good test markets, but if I think of a market, Bill, like New York City, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2130" target="_blank">00:35:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">New York City seems to me to be a problem because there's massive demand for cars in New York City, but there aren't a lot of Teslas sitting around latent, right, that can be tapped into for supply.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2141" target="_blank">00:35:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't think it will work equally well in all markets, but I think it is a massive advantage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2147" target="_blank">00:35:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember, out of there, I think they may have 7 million cars on the road today, something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">About 2.5 million of those I think are hardware 4, and it's going to require hardware 4 in order to run all these cars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2158" target="_blank">00:35:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, we're really talking about a multi-year undertaking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2162" target="_blank">00:36:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you said to me over under on, you know, middle of next year where we have evidence of a single market or two where RoboTaxi is working, I think we will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2173" target="_blank">00:36:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to take the over on that, and that is a huge difference from where the world was 18 or 24 months ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SewIKjE1Lec&t=2180" target="_blank">00:36:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I just
