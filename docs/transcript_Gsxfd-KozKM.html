Where this comes from is that they wanted to see was how do people experience kind of themselves based on how much knowledge or skill they have in a specific area. So they ran these participants through, you know, the study, all of these tests to assess competency in certain areas.</p><p>And then they also surveyed the participants and actually asked them, okay, how well do you think you did? And a lot of us, when we know nothing about something, we're like, yeah, I don't feel very good about that. And once we know a lot about it, we feel very confident.</p><p>But what was really interesting that Dunning and Kruger found is that this very kind of first stage of learning their first stage of competence in something where you're actually very bad at something or your level of knowledge in it is very, very small. A lot of us tend to have a lot of confidence at this time.</p></div></div></body></html>
