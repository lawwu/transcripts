Okay, so first I want to talk about Citibank because there's a lot of changes going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">on. And the first one is the launch of the new Citi Strata Elite card. It's their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">premium travel card. A long time ago, they used to have the Citi Prestige card. In fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone thought this card would replace it. But thankfully, if you still have that old card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.340</a></span> | <span class="t">it doesn't look like it's getting changed. But let's break it down. So it's a $595 annual fee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Though if you have assets at Citi, whether you're Citi Gold or Citi Private Client, that annual fee</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">might be discounted or even completely waived the first year. And as for earnings, gets 12x on hotel and car</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.020</a></span> | <span class="t">rental bookings through Citi Travel. Get 6x on flights booked through Citi Travel. And then the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.820</a></span> | <span class="t">most confusing one, you get 6x on dining, but only Friday and Saturday from 6pm to 6am Eastern.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Otherwise, it's just 3x on dining. Now, they say it's going to be based on the time that the transaction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">gets originally authorized because sometimes restaurants will authorize a transaction and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">then wait to see what the gratuity you put on there might be before they finalize it. But given that this card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">can be used all around the world, I think it's going to be really difficult for most people to keep track of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">time zones when they're outside of the country. And then it gets 1.5x points on everything else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">As for the benefits or perks of this card, you get $300 a year in hotel booking credit through Citi</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Travel. You get $200 in a splurge credit, which they say every calendar year, earn up to $200 in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">statement credits on your choice of up to two of the following brands. First Dibs, American Airlines</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Exclusions Apply, Best Buy, Future Personal Training, and Live Nation Exclusions Apply. So this one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting. You get $200 annually for Black Lane, which is a premium car chauffeur service. You get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">$100 January to June, and then another $100 July to December. You get a priority pass select membership,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which is pretty common among premium cards. This one does not include restaurant access.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It does include guest access. You get four passes to the Admirals Club, which is the American Lounge,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and you get your TSA pre or global entry fee reimbursed every probably four years, just like almost every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">other card. And that's up to $120. So the website says that this is up to $1,500 in value. Let me break</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it down. And then I'll talk about my thoughts on the earnings. Now, the $300 hotel credit seems pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">easy to use. The only requirement is that it has to be a two or more night stay. But unlike the Amex or Chase</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">credits, you can book it at any hotel, it doesn't have to be just an ultra luxury premium hotel. So this could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">great for short stays at less expensive properties that you could knock out all the credit in one go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The splurge credit is a little confusing. I don't even know what First Dibs is. I probably should have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">looked that up before recording. But assuming there aren't too many exclusions, using this at American</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">could probably be pretty easy. There's no exclusions for Best Buy. So at a minimum, you could buy stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">at Best Buy, potentially even resell it. It seems pretty easy to capture this credit. Right now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm particularly interested in the Live Nation credit because I am a huge fan of Weird Al Yankovic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">He's doing a tour right now. We're going to go see the show in August. And so I'm actually looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">at buying tickets and one of the platforms to buy them on is Live Nation. So I would actually use this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">credit potentially right now if I had this card and get the full value. So that's awesome. I'm a huge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Weird Al fan. So I'm really excited to see him live. The Black Lane credit from everything I've read,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it looks like even after this discount, it's still as expensive as Uber, if not a little bit more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'd value this at pretty much zero. I'd probably never use it. It seems like a lot more hassle to use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Priority Pass Select, I already have plenty of these memberships from other premium cards. So for me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that's not valuable. The Admirals Club passes, I don't actually fly American that often. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">believe you have to be flying American to use them. So pretty low value. The only perk I will say is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">these passes can be used by other people. So if you're traveling with a partner,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you could each use a pass twice, instead of you use it four times. Kids are free,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I think under 13. And the pass is good for 24 hours. And I say kids are free, meaning they can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">be your guests. You don't get any adult guests, you'd have to use an extra pass for them. But it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">is good for 24 hours.

I guess if you want to spend a lot of money booking travel with city travel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you could use this card. Though cards like the Venture X and the Chase Sapphire Reserve,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">they also have heavy multipliers on points for booking in their travel portal.

Some people have said that the city travel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">portal doesn't have terrible rates. So at least you're not going to get hosed there, but I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">going to get a card for that. Six X on dining for a very specific window of time, two days a week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">For me, that's just not worth having a card for. And then the rest, three X points on dining,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">one and a half X everywhere else. I have cards that match or beat that easily. So I really don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">think that this is an ongoing spend card for anyone other than someone who loves to book travel and city</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">travel or spends a really, really large amount of money dining out Friday and Saturday nights from 6</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">PM to 6 AM Eastern time. So other than that, not a great card on an ongoing basis, but is it worth a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">bonus? I do think that if you apply now, you'd get a lot of those calendar year credits in 2025 and 2026.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So you could potentially get, if you value them at $500, $1,000 of credit for a $600 annual fee</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and earn a hundred thousand points. City points are pretty hard to come by. So for me, I'm thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">about this purely for the bonus. However, I'm also really interested in adding the city double cash</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">card to my lineup. So either I add the double cash or I add the strata elite, and then maybe a year from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">now downgrade it to the double cash. So I'm trying to figure out what to do here. It is a good bonus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's not a crazy bonus. And there are a lot of bonuses going on right now, but definitely not a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">card that I'm excited to keep in my wallet on a long ongoing basis at all. In fact, just for spending,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the city strata premier card, which I also have is so much better. You get 3x on air travel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">hotels, restaurants, supermarkets, gas and EV charging, and then 1x on everything else. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">definitely love the strata premier. I'm really excited about that card. I think it's a great card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">at a much lower $95 annual fee, but the strata elite is definitely missing something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But as part of the strata elite launch, city did add American Airlines as a transfer partner,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which was an awesome addition because American points are very difficult to come by and have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">ton of great use cases and value.

I did a full breakdown of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">every single city card, made a tier list of them all, broke down the thank you points, rewards program,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">all the rules and everything. The last card they had announced back when I recorded that episode,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that the city strata card was coming out to replace the city rewards plus card. And you can now get that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">card on your own. It's now open for applications and has a 30,000 point signup bonus after spending a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">thousand dollars in three months. It has no annual fee. So it's a pretty good starter card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">primarily because it does have some decent earning. Three points per dollar at supermarkets,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">three points per dollar on gas and EV charging, three points per dollar on a category of your choice,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and then 2x on restaurants. For those categories of your choice, it could be fitness clubs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">streaming services, live entertainment, cosmetic and barber shops and hair salons or pet supply stores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So not a terrible no annual fee card. I tend to think that most cards with $100 annual fee</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">beat this card and pay for their annual fee. But if you're looking at someone who's maybe just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">graduating college, not ready for annual fees, not a bad card. In fact, city has also decided that now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you can transfer points from a lot of their no annual fee cards like the strata card. And unfortunately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it's at a reduced rate.

That card did have a high annual fee, but also offered $325 in travel credits,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">which are now required to be booked through the US Bank travel portal, which is also a bummer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But the biggest bummer is that they're reducing that one and a half cent value of each point to one cent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So it kind of goes from a four and a half percent on travel and Apple Pay card to a 3% on travel and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Apple Pay card where the Apple Pay or whatever you're using is now capped at $5,000 a month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The only potential thing that could make this better is that they have announced that they will be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">having airline and hotel transfer partners.

But as a card that earns four and a half</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">percent on travel and mobile wallet, that's no more.

For example, they say you get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1810" target="_blank">00:30:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">3x on home insurance and property tax.

So that makes it pretty easy to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1828" target="_blank">00:30:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">hit that requirement. There are a bunch of other unique categories that most cards don't have, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1833" target="_blank">00:30:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">something that I really like seeing from a new card, not just another card like the City Strata Elite,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1839" target="_blank">00:30:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">which is focused on dining spend.

And if you tried to apply for this card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1902" target="_blank">00:31:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in the past month and you realized they had a waitlist, it was annoying, I know, but I've been told that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1907" target="_blank">00:31:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that waitlist is gone and you don't have to do it anymore, so you can just apply directly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1911" target="_blank">00:31:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then separate from that card, if you are in the market for a mortgage, I definitely encourage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1916" target="_blank">00:31:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you to at least look at two programs for that. So one, Mesa has a network of mortgage brokers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1921" target="_blank">00:32:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and if you use their network and you end up getting a mortgage through their network,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1925" target="_blank">00:32:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you will get 1x points on the entire value of your loan. So if you have a million dollar mortgage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1930" target="_blank">00:32:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that's a million points. Now, it's not available in all states, and I definitely wouldn't just get a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1935" target="_blank">00:32:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">mortgage for the points if the rate wasn't competitive. Now, maybe it's slightly higher, but the points are worth it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1940" target="_blank">00:32:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe it's not, but absolutely, I'd be looking at that as an option. And if you're not eligible for that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1946" target="_blank">00:32:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or it's not in your state, also take a look at Alaska Airlines, who has a partnership with rate.com.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1951" target="_blank">00:32:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you open a mortgage through that partnership, you get 50,000 Alaska points.

But also, it's important to find the best rate. And if they don't have the best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1968" target="_blank">00:32:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">rates, then that doesn't make sense. And if anyone listening has gone through this process with Mesa or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1973" target="_blank">00:32:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Alaska, please let me know, I'd love to know if their mortgage rates are competitive. And I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1977" target="_blank">00:32:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">gladly share that out in the future. Also, I wrote a full blog post about the Mesa card and all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1983" target="_blank">00:33:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">benefits on the website. So I'll link to that in the show notes. Okay, the next card is an interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1987" target="_blank">00:33:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">one that I'm guessing most of you haven't heard of, unless you've already subscribed to the newsletter,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1991" target="_blank">00:33:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">because I briefly mentioned it. And that is the Nibbles card. So I recently came across the Nibbles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=1996" target="_blank">00:33:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">credit card, which is focused on pet owners. And the core benefit is that they offer free pet insurance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2001" target="_blank">00:33:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">for one dog or cat. They also offer 3x points on pet and vet purchases. But I imagine most people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2007" target="_blank">00:33:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">aren't spending enough in either of those categories to warrant getting a new credit card for it. And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2012" target="_blank">00:33:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">card didn't seem that exciting. So I looked at it, and I immediately was like, nope, not that interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2016" target="_blank">00:33:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Even though they try to pitch on the website, hey, pet insurance can be as high as $749.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2021" target="_blank">00:33:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So this could be interesting. I actually looked it up. We don't have pet insurance on our dog.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2026" target="_blank">00:33:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a 10 year old Vishala. I looked it up. And comparable pet insurance to the policy you get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2031" target="_blank">00:33:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">with Nibbles, which I believe you can actually upgrade if you're eligible, was about $137 a month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2040" target="_blank">00:34:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So look at that and say, wow, that's like $1,500 a year. So all of a sudden, I was like, hmm,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2045" target="_blank">00:34:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">if I want pet insurance, maybe I should go get the Nibbles card and get the pet insurance for free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2049" target="_blank">00:34:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have a dog for, let's say, 10, 12, 15 years, that card will pay for itself way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2055" target="_blank">00:34:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">way more than a lot of other cards. It's like getting a signup bonus every single year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2059" target="_blank">00:34:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Unfortunately, I went through the process, and they said my dog wasn't eligible. They didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2063" target="_blank">00:34:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">give me any reason. Maybe it was his age. So not so much to get excited for. But if the reason really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2069" target="_blank">00:34:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">was the age, maybe if I'd gotten an insurance policy back when the dog was younger, they wouldn't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2073" target="_blank">00:34:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">canceled me because he got older. So if you're going to get pet insurance regularly, this could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2079" target="_blank">00:34:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">actually a really interesting card for you if you're eligible. Fortunately, they let you know if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2083" target="_blank">00:34:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">eligible before you apply. So definitely worth looking into if you're in that narrow market of pet owner</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2089" target="_blank">00:34:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">who has expensive pet insurance that is eligible for pet insurance and wants it. Next card is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2095" target="_blank">00:34:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Rakuten card. You can see there's a lot of cards came out this summer, and it's crazy. But unfortunately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2101" target="_blank">00:35:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">there's not as many exciting ones as I would have wished. The Rakuten card is a great example of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2106" target="_blank">00:35:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So this card is powered by American Express. And I love Rakuten, by the way, as a shopping portal where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2113" target="_blank">00:35:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you can go to earn cash back on so many purchases online. Rakuten is my primary portal, primarily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2119" target="_blank">00:35:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">because you can earn Rakuten cash back, which normally is marketed as earn 3% back or 4% back. But you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2126" target="_blank">00:35:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">take that link it to your Amex account and earn membership rewards points. And if you're able to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2130" target="_blank">00:35:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">your membership rewards points worth one and a half or two cents each, then all of a sudden you're looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2135" target="_blank">00:35:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">at not earning 4x on a purchase, but maybe 6x or 8x in terms of value you can get from your Amex points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2141" target="_blank">00:35:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So I love Rakuten. This card couldn't be less exciting. So let's look first, the welcome bonus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2146" target="_blank">00:35:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Get a $25 welcome bonus when you spend $500 in the first 90 days on your card. I don't think I've ever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">seen a welcome bonus as low as $25 other than zero. $25, probably the worst welcome bonus. It might be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2159" target="_blank">00:35:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">better to just not have one. As for the earnings, the primary marketing benefit is earn an extra 4%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2164" target="_blank">00:36:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">cashback. Now, if you use Rakuten a lot and you spend a lot of money online, you might think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2170" target="_blank">00:36:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this is a really interesting benefit, 4% cashback on everything. And if you scroll down the website,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2176" target="_blank">00:36:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't really see anything mentioned of the exclusions until you really get down and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2182" target="_blank">00:36:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">notice that it is 4% back up to $7,000 in a calendar year. Now, that's 4% total. If you were using,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2190" target="_blank">00:36:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">let's call it the venture card, the double cash card, any card that would get you 2x,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2194" target="_blank">00:36:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you're really only getting an extra 2x. So what is 2% or 2x on $7,000? It's about $140 a year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2203" target="_blank">00:36:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">depending on how you value your points. If it's cashback, it just is $140 a year. And that is if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2207" target="_blank">00:36:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you max out the benefit. It also earns 2% on groceries and restaurants, which is not anything special to write</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2214" target="_blank">00:36:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">home about. So I would say the primary benefit of this card is capped at $140 a year. And the welcome</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2220" target="_blank">00:37:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">bonus is $25 one time. So I'm not going to turn down $140 if someone walking down the street wants</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2226" target="_blank">00:37:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to hand it to me. But there are so many cards that should offer more than $140 in value, especially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2232" target="_blank">00:37:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">when you look at the welcome bonus, that this one is a huge pass. Both the Southwest and the Bonvoy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2237" target="_blank">00:37:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">cards should earn you $1,300 of value in the first year. This card would take nine years to match that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2244" target="_blank">00:37:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">at $140 a year. So this card is absolutely a pass for me. Definitely not something I'm that excited</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2249" target="_blank">00:37:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">about at all. Okay, now the last two cards I want to touch on are crypto related cards. And I've gotten</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2254" target="_blank">00:37:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">so many requests to talk about them, including one about five minutes before I hit record. So this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2259" target="_blank">00:37:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">very timely, they might be getting the fastest request to turn around in history. And so the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2264" target="_blank">00:37:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">one I want to talk about is the Gemini card. I'm not sure why I've gotten so many requests to talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2269" target="_blank">00:37:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">about this card, people seem to be really excited. And I have a theory that I'll share at the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2272" target="_blank">00:37:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But let's just review the card really quick. So Gemini card $200 in Bitcoin when you spend $3,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2278" target="_blank">00:37:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">in your first 90 days. So $200 signup bonus, nothing that exciting. As for spending, you get 4% back on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2285" target="_blank">00:38:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">gas, EV charging, transit, taxis and rideshare, 3% on dining, 2% on groceries and 1% on everything else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2293" target="_blank">00:38:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So is that exciting in terms of earning? Well, I went through my card optimizer tool to try to get a good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2299" target="_blank">00:38:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">sense of this. 4% on gas can be beaten by 15 different cards and matched by another three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2306" target="_blank">00:38:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So 4% on gas, not that exciting. Now keep in mind, I was taking into account the value of points that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2312" target="_blank">00:38:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">give points. So you know, if something earned 3x points, but those points are worth one and a half</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2317" target="_blank">00:38:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">cents, I would call that a four and a half percent on gas. So these numbers might be smaller if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2322" target="_blank">00:38:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">focused only on cashback cards. But 4% transit can be beaten by 13 cards matched by another two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2329" target="_blank">00:38:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">3% on dining can be beaten by 34 cards and matched by another 10. And 2% grocery can be beaten by 48</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2337" target="_blank">00:38:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">cards and matched by another 11. So the actual earnings on these cards, maybe you could argue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2342" target="_blank">00:39:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that if your spending exactly matches these patterns and you only want one card, you don't want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2348" target="_blank">00:39:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">two, then maybe you could say that the cashback on this card is interesting. But I think where most of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2353" target="_blank">00:39:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the people that have written to me asking about this card are getting, I won't say mixed up, but are getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2358" target="_blank">00:39:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">excited is that all of the cashback comes in the form of crypto. You can choose your crypto and it will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2366" target="_blank">00:39:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">automatically invest that. And I think that because some of these emails have said things like, "What</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2371" target="_blank">00:39:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">do you think about the possibility of earning outsized value through crypto?" And to me, that's kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2377" target="_blank">00:39:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">conflating two totally different things. You don't need a credit card that earns crypto to have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2383" target="_blank">00:39:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">possibility of earning outsized value in crypto. You just buy crypto. If you have another cashback card, you could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2389" target="_blank">00:39:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">take all the cashback you get and use it to buy crypto. Or if it's a point card, you could use all the money you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2395" target="_blank">00:39:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">saved on travel and buy crypto. It's that easy. So I don't like tying my investing decisions to other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2402" target="_blank">00:40:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">things in my life. I like to be very intentional and say, "Oh, I've decided I want to invest $100 a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2407" target="_blank">00:40:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">month in Bitcoin. Great. I'll do that." I don't need to tie it to, "Well, I'm going to get a card that will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2412" target="_blank">00:40:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">pay me out in crypto." And the upside of crypto shouldn't be attributed to the earnings in the card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2418" target="_blank">00:40:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So that for me is where I kind of get lost. With this card, if I had it and I thought the earnings was the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2424" target="_blank">00:40:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">best, even if I wanted to invest in crypto, I would still just pick to earn all my cashback in the form of USD</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2431" target="_blank">00:40:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">stablecoin because I don't want to tie those decisions together. I could take that stablecoin and at whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2437" target="_blank">00:40:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">interval I want decide to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum or whatever I want. That's not something I'm saying you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2442" target="_blank">00:40:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">shouldn't do. I just don't like tying them together because I just feel like I want to separate my investing from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2449" target="_blank">00:40:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">how much money I'm earning back. For example, if one month I was going on a 50-state road trip, I would earn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2456" target="_blank">00:40:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot more cashback than normal on gas or EV charging. But that doesn't mean that I want to increase my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2461" target="_blank">00:41:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">exposure to crypto that month. So that's where I get lost with these cards is the idea of earning crypto</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2468" target="_blank">00:41:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">crypto as a perk because I could just invest in crypto. So to me, evaluate this card as a cashback</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2473" target="_blank">00:41:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">card only and then understand that it could automate your crypto investing if you wanted to invest as much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2480" target="_blank">00:41:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or more than your cashback. But at its face value, I would probably focus just on investing in crypto</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2487" target="_blank">00:41:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">separately from what this card earns. So for me, not excited. There are a lot of other cards that can reward</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2493" target="_blank">00:41:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">me as much or more on these categories.

However, there's also a fun thing that I haven't found a way to talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2691" target="_blank">00:44:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">about in an episode yet that I thought would fit in well with the concept of earning a lot more points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2695" target="_blank">00:44:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's talking about some of these crazy challenges that different airlines have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2700" target="_blank">00:45:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">offering and now hotel groups. And one of the first ones that everyone was talking about was last year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2705" target="_blank">00:45:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">SAS joined SkyTeam. They did this big promotion and said, "Anyone who flies with 15 different SkyTeam</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2711" target="_blank">00:45:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">airlines will earn a million points." And it was super interesting because, like I mentioned earlier,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2716" target="_blank">00:45:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">SAS miles are impossible to earn. Obviously, now you can get them through Mesa, but otherwise it's very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2721" target="_blank">00:45:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">hard to get them. And they're super valuable. And this is one of those things that when I saw it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2727" target="_blank">00:45:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I was like, "Gosh, if I didn't have commitments, kids, I would absolutely have done this." In fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2732" target="_blank">00:45:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the team over at Frequent Miler, and I'll put a link in the show notes to their summary,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2737" target="_blank">00:45:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">three different people ended up competing and doing this challenge. And it took them about $5,000 to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2743" target="_blank">00:45:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">$8,000 each to buy enough flights to be able to hit all the requirements, which meant that they were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2750" target="_blank">00:45:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">effectively buying SAS points for about half to 0.8 cents. But of course, that's ignoring the fact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2757" target="_blank">00:45:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that they each got to visit over a dozen different countries. Now, at the end of the promotion, SAS shared</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2761" target="_blank">00:46:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that around 900 people completed the challenge with the youngest person being four years old. That's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2766" target="_blank">00:46:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">cool. Awesome to start someone out with a million miles that early. And it sounds like this kicked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2772" target="_blank">00:46:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">off a real trend. So for anyone who heard this last year and thought, "Oh, I regret this." There have now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2777" target="_blank">00:46:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">been four big promotions at that large value that have come out. And I'm going to run through them really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2782" target="_blank">00:46:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">quickly because most of them are not that interesting or there's not much to do. So one of the first ones</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2789" target="_blank">00:46:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">was the Etihad promo. And they came out and said from May 26th this year to May 25th next year, the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2797" target="_blank">00:46:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">person to fly to the 15 new destinations they had would win 5 million miles. And the second person would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2804" target="_blank">00:46:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">get 3 million and the third person would get 1 million. And then people were kind of a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2808" target="_blank">00:46:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">cold on it, because who knows if you're the first person? Can you imagine flying to 14 of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2813" target="_blank">00:46:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">destinations, boarding the plane for the 15th, and then finding out that, "Oh, three people have just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2819" target="_blank">00:46:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">completed this challenge and now you will earn nothing." That would be a huge letdown. So they added that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2824" target="_blank">00:47:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">first 100 people to get to five destinations would get 25,000 points, and the first 100 people to get to 10 would get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2830" target="_blank">00:47:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">another 100,000 points. So it's interesting, but there was no guarantee. With SAS, everyone who completed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2837" target="_blank">00:47:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the challenge got the points. Here, that's not the case. And so I haven't seen anyone trying to do this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2843" target="_blank">00:47:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">challenge. Also, Etihad miles expire. They have really punitive cancellation policies. And one of the biggest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2849" target="_blank">00:47:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">challenges is that one of the countries on this list is Russia. And I know there are a lot of Americans who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2854" target="_blank">00:47:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">are not too excited about going to Russia right now. So it kind of makes it difficult. So it was cool to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2859" target="_blank">00:47:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">see a five million point challenge. But given that there was no guarantee you would get anything for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2863" target="_blank">00:47:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">competing and there are a lot of other things, it wasn't that exciting. Then Turkish launched a challenge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2868" target="_blank">00:47:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the next month in June, and people were a lot more excited because all you had to do was fly to six</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2874" target="_blank">00:47:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">continents. You did have to connect through Istanbul, but Turkey didn't count as a country. So you needed to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2880" target="_blank">00:48:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">hit one country and each of six continents. Only the destinations counted. So if you flew from San Francisco to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2887" target="_blank">00:48:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Turkey, that wouldn't count as North America, but if you flew back home, it would. And one of the only things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2892" target="_blank">00:48:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that people didn't love was that only paid tickets counted. But it looks like you could have done this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2897" target="_blank">00:48:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">challenge for three to $5,000. And that's not bad for earning a million Turkish miles. I think I forgot to say that it was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2902" target="_blank">00:48:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">million mile challenge. The challenge was that 11 days after launching this promo, they canceled it. So they launched it on June 27th. And then on July 8th, they said, "Nope, sorry. Anyone who has flown one leg is still eligible, but no one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2906" target="_blank">00:48:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">else is eligible." So this is another one where I looked at it and I thought, "Wow, $3,000 to $5,000 for all the flights, but you'd actually get to visit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2924" target="_blank">00:48:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you'd end up with a million miles." So that one was really cool, but you can't do it anymore. So the one that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2929" target="_blank">00:48:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">actually came out that I really thought long and hard about and is still out there for anyone listening to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2934" target="_blank">00:48:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">participate in is the JetBlue 25 challenge. So it's not a million miles on face value, but it's pretty close if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2941" target="_blank">00:49:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you break it down. If you fly to 15 different JetBlue destinations, you get 150,000 points. You fly to 20, you get another 200,000 points. And then if you fly to 25,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2953" target="_blank">00:49:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you get 25 years of Mosaic one status. Now, the notable perk is that when you have Mosaic one status,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2960" target="_blank">00:49:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you get to pick one thing. It's like a pick your choice. One of those things is 15,000 miles. So if JetBlue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2966" target="_blank">00:49:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">lasted 25 years and you picked 15,000 miles a year, that's another 375,000 miles, bringing the total to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2973" target="_blank">00:49:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">725,000 points. So just shy of a million. Now revenue and award tickets count. So you don't even have to pay for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2979" target="_blank">00:49:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the fares. You could use points if you had some JetBlue points. The only catch was you couldn't book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2983" target="_blank">00:49:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">basic economy, and you couldn't book flights with a promo code. Now, a bunch of people, as they do on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2988" target="_blank">00:49:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Reddit, started posting their itineraries. And if you were flexible, you could do this for about $2,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2993" target="_blank">00:49:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, it's still valid. And so if you want to do this, go look at those Reddit threads. And honestly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=2998" target="_blank">00:49:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the biggest reason we didn't consider this is that we don't live on the East Coast. JetBlue's route</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3003" target="_blank">00:50:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">network from San Francisco is like three cities, and they only count the destination. So if you fly from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3009" target="_blank">00:50:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">San Francisco to Fort Lauderdale, you'd get Fort Lauderdale. So you really need to piece together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3013" target="_blank">00:50:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">an itinerary that works really well. And for someone who lives on the East Coast, especially if you could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3017" target="_blank">00:50:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">drive to three or four airports that have JetBlue flights, there is a way to do this that actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3022" target="_blank">00:50:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">looked pretty interesting. For me, it was just fun to try to look at the JetBlue route map and think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3027" target="_blank">00:50:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">about how to do this, even though I had no intention of doing it. But because it's still open, because you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3032" target="_blank">00:50:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">still do it. And because there are a lot of people doing it with their whole family, which means not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3037" target="_blank">00:50:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">just earning 350,000 points, but earning it for four people, and then getting not just 15,000 miles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3043" target="_blank">00:50:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a year, but 60,000 miles a year, if you do it with a family of four, it can be pretty lucrative. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3048" target="_blank">00:50:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll just share that Nick Race from Frequent Miler is doing this with his family of four. He's got a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3052" target="_blank">00:50:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of blog posts, but I'll just break down some of the high level. He shared his plan to hit 20 airports,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3058" target="_blank">00:50:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">because he'd already actually had trips planned for five other destinations. So 20 airports for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3064" target="_blank">00:51:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">about $2,300. He was actually going to use his Amex points to book these. And so if you have an Amex</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3070" target="_blank">00:51:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">business platinum card, and you select JetBlue as your airline, you end up getting your Amex points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3075" target="_blank">00:51:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to be worth about 1.54 cents towards flights that you book on that airline. So it was going to cost him</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3083" target="_blank">00:51:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">about 145,000 points per person. And those flights were going to earn him another 10,000 JetBlue points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3090" target="_blank">00:51:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">per person. And each person would get 350,000 points. So it was spend 145,000 Amex points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3096" target="_blank">00:51:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">zero dollars cash out of pocket, and get 360,000 points. I do think there was maybe one or two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3103" target="_blank">00:51:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">positioning flights he had to take. So I won't say zero out of pocket. But it was like spend 145,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3108" target="_blank">00:51:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">get 360. And if you factor in the 15,000 points a year, and let's just say we assume JetBlue's around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3115" target="_blank">00:51:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">for 25 years, then it would be spend 145,000 get 735,000. Because you also get that 10,000 points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3122" target="_blank">00:52:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that you earn from all the flights. So for him, he had four people, he'd either be spending 9,000 or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3128" target="_blank">00:52:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">spending 580,000 Amex points. But he would end up for his family with 1.44 million JetBlue points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3136" target="_blank">00:52:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">or about 2.9 million JetBlue points if you factor in those 15,000 points a year per person from Mosaic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3142" target="_blank">00:52:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">One status. So pretty cool promo to be able to rack up a ton of points. Even cooler that he's making family</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3149" target="_blank">00:52:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">trips all summer long about this. You have until the end of 2025 to do it. And so if you have flexibility,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3155" target="_blank">00:52:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and you want to try this out, especially if you're on the East Coast, I think it's a pretty cool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3159" target="_blank">00:52:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">challenge.

At a minimum, if you just get emails from Dunkin' Donuts from JetBlue,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3314" target="_blank">00:55:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">from JetBlue, you get 500 points. If you link and use their dining program and spend $25 at a restaurant,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3320" target="_blank">00:55:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you get 500 points. If you use their shopping portable to spend $50 or more, you get 500 points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3326" target="_blank">00:55:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">If you use this thing that I've never heard of until today called Airport Rewards, which rewards you for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3331" target="_blank">00:55:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">spending money at airport restaurants and shops. If you spend $5 at the airport, any airport, there's 100 airports</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3337" target="_blank">00:55:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to choose from. Almost every restaurant at SFO is on the list. You get another 500 points. And then the hardest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3343" target="_blank">00:55:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">one, for me at least, is if you rent any rental car from Avis or Budget and you credit those points to JetBlue, you get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3350" target="_blank">00:55:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">another 500 points. And if you do all five, you get another 5,000 points. So you can get 7,500 points, which at JetBlue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3357" target="_blank">00:55:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">point value is probably around $100. I wouldn't jump out of bed to go try to do this promo, but if you had an Avis or Budget</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3364" target="_blank">00:56:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">rental that you could easily do, then I feel like the other four things would be pretty simple ways to earn a free</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3372" target="_blank">00:56:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">7,500 points from JetBlue. The last one I'm going to mention is the easiest. Choice Hotels has a one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3378" target="_blank">00:56:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">million point sweepstakes right now. You can enter it until October 7th and all you have to do is give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3385" target="_blank">00:56:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">them an email address. Maybe you have to give them your choice number because I just tried to go re-enter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3390" target="_blank">00:56:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and they said I've already entered. But maybe there's a couple other things that you add once you put your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3393" target="_blank">00:56:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">email in. But that's all. No purchase necessary, no stay necessary. One winner is going to get a million</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3400" target="_blank">00:56:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">points. One winner is going to get a VIP NASCAR experience in St. Louis. And 11 other people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3405" target="_blank">00:56:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">one drawn each week from July 22nd to October 7th, are going to get 100,000 choice points. So there is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3411" target="_blank">00:56:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a reason to go enroll yourself earlier rather than later if you want a chance at those 100,000 points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3415" target="_blank">00:56:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously only one person is going to win a million, but it also only takes a couple seconds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3419" target="_blank">00:56:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">so no reason not to do it. Those are all these big challenges. I'm excited to see more of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3424" target="_blank">00:57:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd really love to do one someday. Normally in an episode like this, I talk about some timely promos</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3429" target="_blank">00:57:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that are coming out like I do in the newsletter. But honestly, there are not that many right now that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3a5Ynt9_M&t=3434" target="_blank">00:57:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I think will still be around by the time this publishes.
