apps,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the advice I have for other people building these apps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I lead developer relations for an AI and for a company called Together AI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but probably the most relevant part for this talk is the fact that I build a lot of these AI apps,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and I've probably averaged one a month for the last four years,</span></div><div

done pretty well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and have gotten a good amount of users and GitHub stars as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing I do also is open source, so I'm going to show off some demos, but also you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">check those out in your own time and you can dig into the code as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I said, I lead developer relations for an AI cloud platform called Together AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We're a platform for open source models. We give you an inference API to be able to query</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">really any open source models probably that are out there that are good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have chat models like QEN3. We have reasoning models like DeepSeq R1.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">We have image models like the flux context model that came out recently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have vision models, audio models, you know, almost all modalities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">We also let you run these models on dedicated instances or fine tune them on your own data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And we have a GPU cluster product as well if you want a training cluster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So before I get into the demos, I just want to talk about the fact that it's really a historic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">time right now for building. And I think this is because of two things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Like one, I think the barrier for building has lowered dramatically with a lot of these AI tools,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">right? You can use Cursor and Windsurf with your IDE to auto-complete stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You could use these AI builders like Bolt and V0 and Lovable to prototype</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">apps really quickly. You can use chat apps to kind of brainstorm ideas or go through the process of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">building an app. You know, you can go to a chat app and say, "I'm building a Swift app for the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">time. Can you guide me through how to do it?" Right? So I think like the the barrier has lowered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">on one side and on the other side we're having these like groundbreaking models come out every single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">week that are enabling completely, enabling builders to build completely new things. So it's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">these incredible AI models are coming out that you can build with and it's gotten a little bit easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just think it's an incredible time to be building apps right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to dig into a couple of demos. These are some of the apps I've built that I'll spend like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.560</a></span> | <span class="t">30 seconds on each one demoing really quickly. But one thing to note really quick is the fact that some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of these apps have a couple thousand people that have used them and then some of them have like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">million plus. And I think like at a certain point it is a numbers game and you kind of have to try out a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of different stuff. And I'll talk about kind of how I approach that. So we'll switch into some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">demos. So in the beginning when I was when I started a building kind of a few years ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I wouldn't know what to build. So I'd go on Twitter and I'd look up, you know, people that tweeted like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, I need an app to do this." And so here Samina said, "Can someone build an AI app to help me pick some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">glasses?" And I was like, "Sure, I got you." And, you know, built this little tool that takes a bunch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">different requirements, turns them into a query and then actually uses the Amazon API to find products</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that you can actually, you know, click on and buy. And another one of these was one of my friends Theo</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">tweeted out like, "You know, I just want an AI app that writes my commit messages for me." And my CTO at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">time was like, "I love that idea." And so I just decided to build it. And all it does is when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">do git add, it takes the git diff, it sends it to an AI model, and it writes a commit message for you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and it kind of shows it to you and you can kind of accept it. So this is one of my first apps that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I built that ended up doing really well and got, I think I got about 40,000 people that have installed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it and downloaded it. And it's also open source. And I had a bunch of people contribute, which has been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">great. Another app I built was a like text-to-app builder. There's a bunch of these where you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">type in an app that you want to build. Here I'm going to say like a quiz app about American history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way this works is it takes this prompt, it sends it to an AI model to come up with a project</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">plan, and then it sends it to another model to actually write React code that we can show. So in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">second this should populate, but obviously also open source. I've had about 5 million requests go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.520</a></span> | <span class="t">through this app and about a million apps built just through this. And I have a little over a million</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">people that have ended up using it. So this is an app that kind of just generates images as you go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.120</a></span> | <span class="t">through it. And also has about over a million people and has about 48 million images that were actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">generated with this app. I have an app called napkins where it takes a screenshot of, the idea is it takes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a screenshot of a napkin. The idea is like you draw a little web app on a napkin, it takes a screenshot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it and it can actually build it for you. So yeah, that's, that's another one of my apps. That one has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">about 40,000 users. I have another one that lets people kind of upload a resume and then builds them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.440</a></span> | <span class="t">like a personal site like this for people to check out. And you know, there's, there's a bunch of others,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">ones that visualize menus. I built like an AI chat app, like a tutor app where you can, you know, put in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">topic that you're interested in, like personal finance, and it can explain it in the level of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">like an elementary school, a person, and then some OCR stuff as well. So I'll get back to the slides.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of these apps have a very similar architecture that I end up using. And so this similar architecture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">starts with a user coming in and typing something or uploading an image usually. So it's some sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">user input, right? And I take that and I generally will send it to an AI model on Together AI. So it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">could be like an image to image app where I take an image and I send it to an AI model to make another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.560</a></span> | <span class="t">image and then show that to the user. So step two is I send it to an AI model. Step three, a lot of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">time is I store that image or that text in the database to be able to show it to the user. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">step four is I just show it to the user. So it's a very, very simple architecture. A lot of the time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">there's one single API call happening. The user does something, I send one API call to an AI model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I get the response back and I show it to the user. And I think it's this simplicity that is really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">really important, both for moving very quickly, but also for validating these ideas. The more simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you can drill down an idea, the faster you can kind of build. And then this is my tech stack that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.360</a></span> | <span class="t">usually use. I use Together AI for all of my AI models. I use Next.js and TypeScript as my full</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">stack framework for building things. I use Neon as my database. It's like a really good serverless</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Postgres host. I use Clark for authentication. I use Prisma as a way to talk to my database and TypeScript.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I use Shatzian and Tailwind for styling. S3 for uploading images. Plausible for website analytics. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of showed you guys this in a couple different places. So it's cool that I can see the number of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.840</a></span> | <span class="t">unique visitors. I can also see where they're coming from and what countries and what device they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">using it on. And one thing I always get very surprised by is the fact that a lot of people use most of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">apps on mobile. So it just goes to show that the mobile experience is really, really important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So plausible for website analytics. Helicone for LLM analytics so I can dig into my LLM requests and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like troubleshoot things. And then Vercel for hosting these apps. Cool. So I'm going to talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">about my process for building these apps. And a question I get a lot is like, how do you come up with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">these ideas? Uh, and, and I think like the, the biggest thing I did for ideas that, that helped</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">me out was just to keep a list of running ideas. Um, I think we all get great ideas at random times and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">most of us don't write them down. And I think like, uh, that makes a lot of the difference. And so I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">keeping this list of ideas, uh, trying to write down anytime you see an interesting idea or see an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting product and you say, oh wow, that's actually really cool. Maybe I can use a similar methodology</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to and apply it to something else. Um, so ideation is like, uh, a big thing. And, uh, the list of ideas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I have, I usually always have this short list of like the top five. And so I like, I know right now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of the top five apps I want to build next. Um, and then if anything kind of drops in between,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">then I'll, I'll build it. You know, if a new image model comes out next week, that's like really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">really incredible and open source. Um, I'm probably going to be scrambling to build an app with, with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, naming is another big one. You know, you want a short memorable name. I, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you can use AI tools like domains GPT to kind of, uh, check names that also have the domain name</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">available, uh, to, to use them. Uh, number three is design, you know, thinking through how the app</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">will work. Like, you know, I'm going to have a landing page and a user is going to click like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">enter and then enter and get this page where they upload something and then they see an image, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">know? And so it's like these two screens and, uh, you can either kind of sketch it out on a piece</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of paper or you can use Figma, uh, or you can use a lot of these prototyping tools, uh, to, to try to help you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">think through, uh, what, what the app is. Uh, and then I go about building the actual app.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So trying to make the simplest possible working version of a specific app. Um, and like I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I, I always try to shoot for like one API endpoint, you know, like one, like just very, very simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, step five is like, you know, I have a working prototype now. I, I start to think through, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">authentication and limits of like, okay, like how expensive, uh, is this? Like how many, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">how many uses uses do I want to give each person per day? Do I want to want to add authentication?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Do I want to add, bring your own API key? Uh, so it really just depends on, on the app and the AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">model that I'm using. Uh, and then step six is usually kind of prepping for the launch, getting a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">nice OG image, getting a domain, adding analytics, uh, writing a nice read me. Cause like I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">everything I kind of do is open source. So I also want to make sure the code is really easy to use and really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">easy to, uh, to clone. Um, and then the last step is actually launching. And so I usually use LinkedIn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">or X to, to launch and, uh, you know, kind of, uh, just see what people say at that point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. Final section. Uh, and then I think we'll get into some Q and A. We have a little bit more time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">because the demos didn't work. Um, so advice for building apps. I have these like seven tips that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to go through. Uh, one is thinking of an idea that excites you, but is very, very simple,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, that you should be able to describe to anyone in five words, right? Like blink shot,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">generate real time images, llama coder, go from some text to an app, right? Like, and I think this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is one of the biggest mistakes people use as they try to, they try to think like, okay, you know what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I like, I want to build this like personal CRM software that has this dashboard that will email</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">me every week and do this and that. And you know, they come up with this like grandiose version and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">spend like six months building it. And then they realize, oh wow, it's like, it's, it's, um, this isn't,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this wasn't the right thing to build or, um, this is just like really hard and nobody cares about it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">now. And so it's all about, uh, thinking of an idea that excites you, but it's also a really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">really simple number two. And this is very underrated is making sure the UI looks good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of the apps I showed you are AI apps, but I actually spend 80% of the time on the UI for most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of my apps. Um, and that should tell you like how, how important this thing is. I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I've like the first few apps I've built kind of looks really, really bad. And that was a big part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of why nobody kind of used them. And I've started learning that even if you take a really simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">idea or something that's like so simple, like summarizing a PDF, right? You can go to ChatGPT</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and summarize a PDF right now, but I built a PDF summary app and I spent a lot of time making it look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">really, really, really good. And then I had tens of thousands of people that ended up using it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so it's all about making it look really good, making it really easy to use, and making it really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">really straightforward. Um, the third tip is just keeping the app simple. I talked about this a bunch,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but most of my apps have only one or two API calls. Um, tip number four is trying to incorporate the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">latest AI models. A lot of these apps, um, that, that I showed you have like used some of the latest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">AI models like BlinkShot, the real-time image generation app, um, that used, uh, a model called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">FluxChannel. And I, and I launched this app, I think two days after this model came out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so it was one of the first apps that leveraged kind of this new technology or this new,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">really, really fast model that was good. Um, and so doing that kind of increases, uh, the potential</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">for, uh, virality. Uh, tip five is launching early and then iterating. Um, for a lot of these apps,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">like still to this day, you know, like 40 apps later, I still have no idea what will do really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">really well versus what won't. Um, and the only way to de-risk this is to simplify your project,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to launch early. And then if nobody really cares about it or not a lot of people use it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=810" target="_blank">00:13:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">then at least, you know, you didn't spend six months building, you spent a week building and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you can kind of move on to another idea. Cool. Uh, another tip that I, that I've kind of done is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to make it free and open source. Um, so folks can kind of learn from you and are also very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">incentivized to share it. Um, and so, uh, the, the, this is something that that's worked well, uh, for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the last tip I have is, uh, just keep shipping. Um, a lot of AI apps, like I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">don't do very well. It's a numbers game. You have to kind of keep building and building and building.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And the more you build, the more you realize, you know, kind of what resonates and what doesn't,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the faster you get at building, uh, and the better you get at like picking, picking ideas. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">um, a lot of it just comes down to, you know, putting in the hours, building a lot of stuff,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and then, uh, seeing what happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's all I have.

Uh, you have a lot of traction success more than many, most YC startups. Why don't,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">why don't you just start a company? It seems like the perfect formula. I'm just really curious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=900" target="_blank">00:15:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Um, that's a good question. I mean, a part of it is I, I really enjoy, um, I really enjoy teaching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and a lot of these apps, like I can, a lot of these apps, first of all, do well because they're free and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">open source. Right. And so, because I'm, I'm strictly not trying to monetize them. I'm, I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">strictly like trying to make them free and I get companies to kind of sponsor it and, and, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and, and keep it open source. Um, so I just kind of enjoy doing that and launching these apps. And I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I will also like make videos and blog posts about different things. Uh, but yeah, maybe eventually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll, I'll come out with an idea that I really, really love working on and, uh, and, and do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But, um, for now it's just been really fun getting to build a lot of the stuff and experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If you ever do start a startup, let me know, uh, how Andrew invest. Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. So what are some common trends with ideas that maybe you thought were good,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but didn't resonate with people and the reverse? What are the surprises been?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's a really good question. Um, where have the surprises been? It's, it's been a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">bit random, honestly. Um, I think, I think one insight I got is like building apps where people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">can very easily share what they create tend to do way, way better. Um, and so now I try to think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">about that, like building in that viral loop into my apps on like, if you can generate an image, I want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to make it really easy to share that image or and share it with like a really nice OG image. Um, and so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that's one insight I've had is like, you know, apps that have that viral loop of, of like, Oh, this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">really cool. And I can share this with a friend and they can go on it and try it out and they can go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.080</a></span> | <span class="t">on it. Um, and so that's something that I've incorporated a little bit more. Yeah. Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I love that you're making all of this, like, you know, it's all free so far. It's not monetized,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but how are you paying for like all the compute and the model calls yourself? Like, are you funding this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=1005" target="_blank">00:16:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, great question. So, um, first off, you know, I, I work at together AI, we sponsor all of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">compute in terms of the AI models, uh, but then I'll also partner with other AI companies like neon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">gives me a free database to use their database and, and like, you know, all like Clark gives me a free</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">account for authentication. And, uh, uh, and the reason for that is because it's, it's, it's all open</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">source. So it's, it's in their best interest to be in that open source project and, and for people to use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it.

Um, more often than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">not, if you launch something and you reach out to these companies and you say, hey, like I'm building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">this, this open source app, can you please give me some credits?

You can just build an app with an AI model and then a better AI model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcseUQJ6Gbg&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">comes out three months later and you can go.
