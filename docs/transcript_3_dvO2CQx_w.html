And so you can imagine a lot of the sources of dynamism in the world actually going away if we had enough technology.</p><p>You could imagine a government that was able to actually surveil everyone, which is not something you can do now, with a dictator who actually doesn't age or die, who knows everything going on, who's able to respond to everything, and then you could imagine that world just being completely stable.</p><p>I think this is a very scary thought, and it's something we have to be mindful of, that if the rate of technological progress speeds up a lot, we could quickly get to a world that doesn't have a lot more dynamism, and is a lot more. I think when you think about, if you imagine that we're going to get this explosion in scientific and technological advancement, I think you have to take pretty seriously the idea that could end by hitting a wall, that there could not be a lot of room for more dynamism, and that we could have these kind kind of very stable societies.</p></div></div></body></html>
