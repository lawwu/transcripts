the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKUMT6Bj4l8&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">so the thing we wanted to do was to make sure that the next time we start up our computer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKUMT6Bj4l8&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.320</a></span> |
