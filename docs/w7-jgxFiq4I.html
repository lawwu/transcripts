target="_blank">00:02:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a very telling phrase.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Their enthusiasm was so out of proportion with reality that they were giving the impression in some way that their teachers were starting to take the place of Christ, because Paul said, "Was Paul crucified for you?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that's just by way of preface.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A chastened enthusiasm for all human teachers and heroes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, here's my response to those two criticisms you raised.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One, yes, they are gloriously out of step with contemporary culture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That includes both secular American culture and the largely white evangelical culture with its love affair with human self-determination and so-called free will, its entertainment mentality, its downplaying of the importance of doctrine, its normalization of comfort and ease and wealth, and the neglect of holiness and sacrifice and justice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Its marginalization of the majesty and sovereignty of God, etc., etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, yes, they are gloriously out of step with contemporary church and secular culture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's my response, first, to number one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Number two, no, I don't think that 10,000 younger and older men who read Calvin and Owen and Edwards and Spurgeon are "boys with father wounds who are looking for spiritual fathers and pick dead guys who won't actually get to know them or correct them."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That is so off the charts, not the experience of reading these guys.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, in fact, I would say that to the degree that Father Hunger figures into our motives, and I'm saying our, I'm 73, I'm not a young restless reformed anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been reading these guys for 50 years, since I was 23 years old.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it generally works the other way around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Namely, we, or they, these people who are reading all these old dead white guys, we taste the greatness of what it means to be fathered by those who lovingly blow our cherished idols to smithereens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, let me expand on each of those two observations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Number one, with regard to the first, the fact that old dead writers from another century are out of step with our times is why you read them, not why you don't read them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, those of us who care about ethnic diversity and harmony and justice should see this especially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We should see this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Crossing the boundaries, say, of three centuries into the past is a greater cultural stretch than crossing the boundaries to other ethnicities in America in our time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, it's not as though reading men from the 18th or 17th or 16th centuries, let alone an African from the 5th century, like Augustine, are culturally or temperamentally or presuppositionally close to us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They aren't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They are more alien to us in all these ways than virtually all of our American contemporaries, whatever ethnicity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's one reason they are valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And remember, I'm saying this with a chastened enthusiasm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, here's what Lewis said.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">C.S. Lewis, very crucial on this issue about reading people outside your own century.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He said, "We may be sure that the characteristic blindness of the 20th century," we would now say the 21st century, "concerns something about which there is untroubled agreement between Hitler and Roosevelt."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we might say, "Something about which there is untroubled agreement between the Grandmaster of the KKK and Bernie Sanders."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">None of us can fully escape this blindness, but we shall certainly increase it and weaken our guard against it if we read only modern books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think, yes, keep on reading those outside your century.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Get back to 300 years and cross all those cultural barriers, and it will be good for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's my response in a fuller way to that second issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's grasping at straws to suggest that what's motivating 10,000 young men to read Calvin, Owen, Edwards, Spurgeon, it's grasping at straws to say that they are desiring to find a father figure who won't convict them of their sins and errors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was 22 years old when I met the real Jonathan Edwards—not just the sinners in the hands of the angry god Edwards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I read Edwards nonstop through seminary and grad school.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I recall reading Edwards' Freedom of the Will during seminary, and I remember my whole theological scaffolding—and I had a big personal investment in it, just like we all do—I recall my whole theological scaffolding collapsing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember weeping. I would go home to my desk. At my desk, put one elbow on each side of the Bible and weep, cry with confusion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I recall sitting in a rocking chair in Germany a few years later, in the evenings, reading for the first time Edwards' religious affections as my proud heart was laid bare, layer after layer, by his chapter on evangelical humiliation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that chapter—what, from 250 years ago?—that chapter did a deeper work of conviction in my heart than I can recall ever any other living or dead source doing on me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So believe me, I have not stayed with Edwards because he has been easy on me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

Edwards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-jgxFiq4I&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And for those that are hard on him today because of his failures, I just pray that they will have this same precious, painful experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
