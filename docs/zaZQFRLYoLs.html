That was until last week. A couple of things happened</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=23" target="_blank">00:00:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">at the same time. First, I got sick. So I was home sick for about a week. You might still hear it in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">my voice today. So I found myself without much to do. I was off and bored and my phone was there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And suddenly I was looking at that thing much more than I normally would.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Then, piling on, we had Hurricane Helene here in the States, which caused the disastrous flooding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in Asheville.

It punctuated everything that was going on in my life. And I'll tell you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">here's my review of that period. It was terrible. But the scary thing is, I think this is how a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of people live basically all the time, with that phone just sort of always there, never that far</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">away from their life. This concerns me based on my experience. So what I want to talk about today</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is what happens. Let's define and explore what happens when your phone plays a constant presence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in your life. And then let's get to some solutions, what you could do if you want to get away from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that. All right. So let's start with trying to explain what it is that happens when you use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">their phone that much. A statistic here I think is helpful. How often do we check our phones?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">According to one survey I found from reviews.org, which is roughly in line with other data I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">seen, Americans now check their phone an average of 144 times a day. We're also spending an average</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of four hours and 25 minutes total each day on our phone. That latter statistic is up 30% from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">last year. If you do the math on 144 minutes of checks, rather, of your phone per day and assume</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">roughly a 16-hour waking day, that's checking your phone roughly every 6.7 minutes is what that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">averages out to.

Let's call it continuous partial participation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in the networked digital. Most people, or at least a lot of people right now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">exist in a state of this continuous partial participation in the networked digital.

That's what I felt was terrible. Let's try to understand what goes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">wrong in this particular state.

I mean, I could see what was going on. I was having conversations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">with people.

It's more obvious. So if you're a math student, you have a problem set, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2225" target="_blank">00:37:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">10 problems. You wouldn't say, well, my problem is I keep having to switch my context because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2233" target="_blank">00:37:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">first I'm working on this problem. And then I have to work on this problem, which is a different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2237" target="_blank">00:37:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">problem. And then I'm working on this third problem and it's dealing with something different. And my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2242" target="_blank">00:37:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">context switch is like, no, no, working on the problem set is one context. You're in the world</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2247" target="_blank">00:37:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of doing math problems. It's like a radio host, like what I'm doing now. I see answering these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2253" target="_blank">00:37:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">five questions I'm answering as a deep work session, not five deep work sessions that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2257" target="_blank">00:37:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of unrelated. So in general, think about this. If you worry that your deep work is too fragmented,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2263" target="_blank">00:37:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but what's happening is you have one deep work requiring thing after another,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2269" target="_blank">00:37:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">start treating that whole thing as one big session. It changes your mindset.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2272" target="_blank">00:37:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You pace yourself, you maintain better concentration.

I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2290" target="_blank">00:38:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">feeling a bit of notebook overwhelmed.

So however many notebooks you have in your remarkable two, you're saving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2305" target="_blank">00:38:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">yourself having to carry or keep track of that many notebooks. I also don't have everything in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2311" target="_blank">00:38:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">my remarkable two. Mainly I do single purpose notebooks. I still do those. Almost everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2317" target="_blank">00:38:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">else. I guess I do have my remarkable two. I've got my planner, obviously time block planners</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2321" target="_blank">00:38:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">paper. I don't do that in my remarkable. I have single purpose notebooks. I don't have any going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2326" target="_blank">00:38:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">right now. But when I'm working on a new big project, I'll pull that out to really get into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2332" target="_blank">00:38:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Small field notebook just for working on a single project.

So I think it's okay if you have some other notebooks. If you have other sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2343" target="_blank">00:39:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">physical notebooks that aren't single purpose, you just sort of are using pages of some normal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2349" target="_blank">00:39:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">notebook or legal pad to work on something. You might want to bring that back to your remarkable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2354" target="_blank">00:39:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">two. I kind of like the discipline of like, this is just like my general purpose notebook for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2359" target="_blank">00:39:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">working out anything that needs to be worked out because now you have a nice copy of everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2362" target="_blank">00:39:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You only have to bring one thing with you. But I think a planner plus remarkable plus single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2367" target="_blank">00:39:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">purpose notebooks, that's a completely fine combination. To me, that makes a lot of sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2370" target="_blank">00:39:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Remarkable. All right, here we go. Next up is Natasha. Have you considered adding the category</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2379" target="_blank">00:39:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">creativity to the deep life buckets of craft contemplation community in celebration? I guess</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2384" target="_blank">00:39:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">this could fit into craft category, but I think it goes deeper than that. Well, when it comes to deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2390" target="_blank">00:39:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">life buckets, the key is having buckets. The particular collection of buckets you have is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2395" target="_blank">00:39:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">somewhat arbitrary, right? So like the whole idea here is just to make sure that when you are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2399" target="_blank">00:39:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">reflecting on what matters to your life, that you're not getting myopic, that you're not having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2405" target="_blank">00:40:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">all of your attention snap into just one aspect of your life, such as your career. And so having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2410" target="_blank">00:40:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the different areas broken out allows you to look at each of those areas separately and have a part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2417" target="_blank">00:40:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of your vision for the life well lived that touches on each of those areas, right? So when you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2422" target="_blank">00:40:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">creating that master narrative, your ideal lifestyle, these buckets are going to help you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2427" target="_blank">00:40:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">be sufficiently broad in that thinking. When you're trying to take action to get closer towards your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2433" target="_blank">00:40:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">ideal lifestyle, these buckets will help you divide those actions among different areas that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2437" target="_blank">00:40:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">are important, right? So having buckets is critical. The specific buckets you use, it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2443" target="_blank">00:40:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't really matter. You'll probably change them. So for example, I've been experimenting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2448" target="_blank">00:40:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">recently with a different set of bucket definitions that are based off of a body metaphor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2455" target="_blank">00:40:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll run this by quickly. I should do a whole episode on this, but just to give you a sense,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2459" target="_blank">00:40:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">like something I've been messing around with, because it actually works kind of well. It's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2463" target="_blank">00:41:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">alliterative, but it's based on the body. So think about this. You have, when thinking about your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2471" target="_blank">00:41:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">ideal life, the head, so this is where you're thinking about your mental life, your intellectual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2478" target="_blank">00:41:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">life. It's things like ideas and reading and what quiet and what role your phone plays in your life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2484" target="_blank">00:41:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and like the type of stuff we were playing in the deep dive. That's covered in your head in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2488" target="_blank">00:41:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">metaphor. You have the heart, that covers relationships, connection to community, to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2495" target="_blank">00:41:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">family, to other people, right? So that's where you deal with like the role of other people in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2499" target="_blank">00:41:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">your life. Hands, this is sort of corresponds to craft. Your work, like what it is that you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2507" target="_blank">00:41:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">actually creating, but also like skilled pursuits that may be non-professional, like hobby type</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2512" target="_blank">00:41:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">pursuits, but it's craft in general. We think about like what you're building things with your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2517" target="_blank">00:41:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">hands. So it's like producing new things of value in the world and enjoying the process of doing it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2522" target="_blank">00:42:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">yourself. This is kind of stretching the body a little bit, but we could say the soul, the deal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2527" target="_blank">00:42:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">with philosophical, theological type of issues that are critical to your conception of your life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2533" target="_blank">00:42:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to well live. And then here's a new one I added. So Jesse, this didn't fall under the alliterative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2538" target="_blank">00:42:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">buckets that had the C's in it. Feet, and I don't know if you can guess, but what I'm thinking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2545" target="_blank">00:42:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">for feet is the places you live in exist. So that's thinking about on the big scale, like where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2553" target="_blank">00:42:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I live, you know, what city do I live in? What type of house door in that city? Where do I live?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2560" target="_blank">00:42:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Like it could be those types of decisions, but it can also be the spaces in the place you already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2564" target="_blank">00:42:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">live. So like the renovation I'm doing on the maker lab of the HQ, that would also be something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2569" target="_blank">00:42:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that would fall under the feet, the feet component of this type of deep life decomposition. It's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2575" target="_blank">00:42:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">where you, the places you stand. That's one it's coming up and I'm working on my deep life book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2582" target="_blank">00:43:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It's coming up that we didn't deal enough with that probably in the show, but like the places</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2588" target="_blank">00:43:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">in which you exist play a big role in like your perception of a life, like where you live, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2593" target="_blank">00:43:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">type of place you live in, what your spaces are like. So like I'm messing around with that. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2597" target="_blank">00:43:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a body metaphor, you know, I don't know, maybe something else works as well. I, what I'm trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2602" target="_blank">00:43:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to emphasize there is you do need categories for understanding the parts of your life that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2606" target="_blank">00:43:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">are important to you, but my categories might be different than yours and your categories might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2611" target="_blank">00:43:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">change over time. Just like now I've moved on from the alliterative C's to trying out body metaphors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=2617" target="_blank">00:43:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.

But it's like Pete Rose and how he was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=4091" target="_blank">01:08:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">hitting or this or that.

This is a book on ethics, and it's like a reference book. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=4162" target="_blank">01:09:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it's 600 pages, doorstop, and it's like topic by topic, and then with each topic, it's broken down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=4170" target="_blank">01:09:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in the numbered subtopics.

Now, there's the sort of formal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=4199" target="_blank">01:09:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">study of ethics, like coming out of philosophy, and you can study Kant and all this sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=4203" target="_blank">01:10:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">normative thinking. But I was like, "I just need to brush up on what our ancient sources tell us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=4210" target="_blank">01:10:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">about what's good and what's bad in certain situations." So I figured, "Okay, if you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=4215" target="_blank">01:10:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to keep going back, you're eventually going to end up at Jewish sources." So much of the ideas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=4219" target="_blank">01:10:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of modern Western ethics originate in ideas that go all the way back to the oldest books of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=4226" target="_blank">01:10:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Hebrew Bible, which then influenced Christianity, influenced Islam, and then influenced Enlightenment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=4232" target="_blank">01:10:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">human right-based thinking.

So I said, "Great, I'm going to read a book. This is Jewish ethics." So it goes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=4245" target="_blank">01:10:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">through just super systematically, like, "Well, here's what we know about this from Torah," or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=4250" target="_blank">01:10:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">what Talmud says here, what a medieval commentary says here. It's just systematic. At some point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=4254" target="_blank">01:10:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I was like, "I'm just going to read this whole thing.

It's going to really break down in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=4281" target="_blank">01:11:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">subcategories. Like, okay, but what happens if, what about the situation in which you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=4288" target="_blank">01:11:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">gossiping about another person, but that gossip could prevent the person you're gossiping to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=4295" target="_blank">01:11:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">from being defrauded? So it's like the prohibition of gossip or the need to help your friend from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=4301" target="_blank">01:11:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">being defrauded, like, what takes precedence? Well, in that case, you should help your friend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=4306" target="_blank">01:11:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">from being defrauded, but minimize the information you give so that it's sufficient to avoid that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZQFRLYoLs&t=4314" target="_blank">01:11:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">but no more than that, because then you're reveling in the gossip.
