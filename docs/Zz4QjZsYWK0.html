I don't know. I yap a lot, so it's going to be hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=24" target="_blank">00:00:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I got 20. I got 20. That's plenty. Time's ticking. Time's ticking. Should I just stall so I don't have Q&A? Crowd's tough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So I wanted to talk about Huawei's chips, right? Because we never get to talk about them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=41" target="_blank">00:00:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Huawei is really, really cracked. They absolutely destroyed everyone in 5G and telecom by just engineering better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And now they've done something that's super interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So they have the Ascend 910B and C, which you may have heard of, which are chips that they make.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they've turned it into this really cool system architecture, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, NVIDIA talks a lot about Blackwell and VL72. It's one rack with 72 GPUs connected together in NVLink.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Huawei has done something similar. It's called the Cloud Matrix 384.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">384 of their chips, right, connected together in not one rack, but like 12.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a ton of optics and power connecting them all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">What's interesting is that their architecture is actually one that NVIDIA tried to deploy and they failed at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was called DGX-H100 Ranger, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Which was 256 NVIDIA GPUs connected together in one NVLink network with optics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.900</a></span> | <span class="t">They tried and it did not work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">They could not bring it to production because it was expensive, power hungry, and unreliable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And that sort of was the impetus for why Blackwell, they instead stopped going, you know, hey, 10, 20 kilowatts per server to 120 kilowatts in one server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That is effectively one whole rack because they wanted to keep it all in copper, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas DGX-H100 Ranger and also the Huawei system uses optics to connect all the GPUs at super high bandwidth in the high bandwidth, you know, NVLink or I can't remember what the Ascend Cloud Matrix pod is called, their scale-up network.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's quite interesting that Huawei was able to engineer something that NVIDIA effectively failed at, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, obviously, this is way more, you know, power hungry, of course, potentially unreliable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.260</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And it would be expensive except for the fact that, like, you know, China's really good at making things cheap, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's something interesting about the Huawei system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What's interesting about the geopolitics of this is that despite the fact that Huawei is a sanctioned entity, China is a sanctioned country,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">they're still able to actually access TSMC to manufacture these chips, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The chip is manufactured at TSMC through Sofco, which is a Bitcoin cryptocurrency mining company that pretended to not be attached to Huawei and just bought these chips.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's, you know, HBM, which is high bandwidth memory from Samsung and Hynix in Korea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And then all the equipment to package it together is from the U.S., Netherlands, and Japan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's funny that sanctions are completely useless because they're still able to access this stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's interesting is, you know, what I'm showing on the right is that they've made, you know, they have roughly 3 million chips worth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.140</a></span> | <span class="t">They have 2.9 million chips worth from TSMC.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.020</a></span> | <span class="t">That's allegedly stopped now, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The U.S. gave TSMC like a billion dollar fine for $500 million of revenue that they made, which seems like a slap on the wrist, honestly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, SMIC is also going to, which is China's TSMC, is going to start making it as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing I would say is what's funny is that HBM was also banned to China entirely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But instead of just like, hey, HBM's banned, there's cool ways to circumvent this, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is Samsung sells to this company called Coasia in Taiwan, and then Coasia sells to this company called Faraday, which packages it into a chip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, there's a fake chip, basically, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">A chip that does literally nothing, and it has HBM packaged on it, and they ship it to China, and then they take the HBM off of that chip, and then put it on the Ascend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And this actually circumvents all the rules and regulations, so this is completely legal, which I think is, like, very funny.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Huawei has stackpiled roughly 13 million HBM stacks, you know, already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're continuing to receive more shipments, which is fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Very, very interesting that, you know, that's kind of possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing is, you know, domestically, they have not been able to manufacture in the past, but now they're able to, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">China's SMIC, right there, TSMC, has enough tools for 50,000 wafers a month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Today, the only 7-nanometer chip that anyone's found from SMIC is their smartphone chip, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Smartphone chips are smaller, easier to make.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">They yield better than large AI chips.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you look at, like, hey, 5-nanometer, the first 5-nanometer chip was an iPhone chip in 2020, but NVIDIA didn't release a 5-nanometer GPU until 2022, 2023 with the H100, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so likewise, right, SMIC is making 7-nanometer for phones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.620</a></span> | <span class="t">They're going to get to the point where they can start making 7-nanometer for AI chips, likely in very high volumes this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And based on the yields, they can actually get, like, you know, millions and millions, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's, you know, the thought that China will not have equivalent compute is, like, kind of wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.820</a></span> | <span class="t">They will have a lot of compute, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Which will be interesting, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, you know, there's already, like, big announcements from DeepSeq that they're going to work and use Huawei chips to try and train their next generation models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that'll be really interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing that's interesting is, you know, recently, NVIDIA got banned from selling their H20.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">This is, like, a cut-down H100 or H200 to China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.500</a></span> | <span class="t">They wrote down $5 billion worth of inventory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And on the earnings call, Colette, the CFO, said, if we didn't have export restrictions, we would have sold $50 billion worth of GPUs to China this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Which I thought was, like, a very interesting comment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But the ban stopped about a million GPUs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you, yeah, it's quite interesting that, like, you know, that amount of compute was also blocked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the other sort of geopolitical thing that everyone's talking about, besides China, is the Middle East, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So recently there was a deal in the Middle East.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, Trump went to the Middle East.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">He didn't go to Israel.</span></div><div class="c"><span

interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, not to get political, but, you know, that's interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.400</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And the deal is basically that G42 can buy 500,000 GPUs a year, and they get to keep 20% of them to do whatever they want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.020</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And so G42 is building a 5-gigawatt data center campus.</span></div><div

| <span class="t">You know, OpenAI and all these other guys are 200 or less megawatts for the models they've released.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So these are absolutely ginormous, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Stargate, the first six parts of it in total is 1.2 gigawatts, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, this is a massive data

target="_blank">00:07:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But if everyone remembers back, like, in 2023, Sam was always like, hey, $7 trillion, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.940</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, he's throwing this crazy-ass number out, or everyone kept reporting about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The interesting thing is that part of this was that OpenAI wanted to build GPU clusters in the Middle East, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And so not, like, publicly stated, but it's like OpenAI is going to have a cluster in the Middle East, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's a big part of this deal as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And in concession, right, the U.S. gets a couple benefits, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">UAE is providing

target="_blank">00:08:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's already started, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">G42 has sites in, like, Kentucky and New York that they're spending in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

the goal of this data center?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I think,

<span class="t">People today now, in their inference clusters at night in the U.S., are just running reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">generating, you know, trajectories and then, you know, keeping the good tokens when there's low utilization, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So,

target="_blank">00:09:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that there's, like, the lines are blurring between what is an inference and training cluster.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">so they don't have a ton of sun, like, making the city way too hot and it's clean and whatever, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it's a really interesting thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.820</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is real.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">This is definitely happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They've already broke ground on, like, a two gigawatt data center.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, like, for context, XAI's entire training

class="t">And they've spent, like, $10-plus billion on it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you've got to rationalize these numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's, like, 10x more, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So DataVault is going to invest $20 billion in U.S. data centers in addition to building a bunch in the Middle East.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then a bunch of American companies are going to invest as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So the total investment number is, like, $80 billion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">DataVault is the data center company for Humane, which is sort of the neocloud for the data center company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Humane, they've signed deals to, like, get custom CPUs from Qualcomm and buy a bunch of AMD GPUs as well as NVIDIA GPUs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Humane is actually the Aramco folks, the Aramco, Aramco Digital folks, which is the vast majority of Grok's revenue as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's likely Grok stuff in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, like, 90-plus percent of Grok's revenue or they've got money from them is coming from the Aramco Digital folks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's also an AWS thing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So all these American companies are also, like, coming together with the Middle East.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question is, like, you know, why the heck are we sending all these GPUs to the Middle East is what, like, the EAs would say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the, like, capitalists will be like, fuck, yeah, GPUs and money, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, it depends on what side of the fence you're on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And I like to think, you know, I'm on one side of the fence, so I'll tell you which side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=710"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what if these GPUs get smuggled, right, to China?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it's not like Saudi Arabia and the UAE are allies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.380</a></span> | <span class="t">They are – they conveniently

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe they get rented to China, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there's the argument that these GPUs would have been used in the U.S.

sort of the arguments against it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the supporters are obviously, right, like, yes, more GPUs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=773"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, an easy example is OpenAI, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">They want a lot, lot more GPUs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="t">And OpenAI is like, but we can convince someone to build it for us, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Because OpenAI is really nice, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, they get to rent the GPUs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, like – but the thing is, their provider has to build the data center and buy all the GPUs, and then they don't get payback for two or three years, right, of renting GPUs, even though the contract is for, like, five years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, there's all this theoretical profit, but you don't actually get the money back on the cluster until year two or three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if Microsoft now builds a $100 billion data center for OpenAI, and then OpenAI doesn't raise $150 billion to pay for it, then, you know, Microsoft is just left holding the bag.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And who wants that big of a data center, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, unless you believe, like, AI's demand is, like, unlimited, then, you know, you kind of – there's a big risk here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And the nice thing is, like, you know, a fool is easily parted with their money, and SoftBank and the Middle East are the most stupid investors in the world, potentially.</span></div><div

fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they're

to have someone pay for the cluster, buy all these GPUs, build all the data centers, and then, like, with the promise, they're going to rent them, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And the same applies to all the other AI labs across the West,

I would make is that, you know, OpenAI, because of this, will have more compute in 2027 or 2028 than they would have had without it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It wouldn't have been built in the U.S.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, there's big problems with America in terms of being able to build GPUs, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is that there is a massive deficit of power, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there's no access on the chart on the left for a reason, all right, for people taking a picture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But on the right, you know, Middle East is building, you know, by 2030, like, four gigawatts, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=918" target="_blank">00:15:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's, like, so on the right is, like, sort of our data center data, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It's saying there is a 63

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're tracking every single one site by site, et cetera, building by building, with satellite photos, permits, regular providing, all this stuff, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=935"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you can have a lot of, like, strong assumptions about renewables, biobatteries, and then all of the single cycle and dual cycle gas reactors that are being installed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=947"

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And you still have this massive, massive, you have 44 gigawatts being added, but you have on the power side, and that's assuming, you know, with the fluctuations and all that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas you're adding 100 gigawatts of data center capacity.</span></div><div

argument sort of is, like, well, geopolitically, the U.S. can't build enough data centers, can't build enough power, whether it's for the lack of skilled labor,</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz4QjZsYWK0&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">They added an entire U.S. grid in seven years, right?</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:16:54.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the U.S. just doesn't know how to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
