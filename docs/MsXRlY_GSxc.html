I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">introduce the idea of slow distractions versus fast distractions. I'm then going to explain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">why slow distractions are a better way to spend your free time than their fast counterpart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I will talk about how to specifically rewire your brain to prefer slow distractions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's start by trying to be clear about what do we mean by a slow versus fast distraction,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a slow distract, a fast distraction, rather.

So I'm going to, with great trepidation, do some illustration here. So for those who are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">watching, instead of just listening, I'm going to load up on the screen. You'll see two columns,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">fast and slow, so we can sort of illustrate what we're talking about. All right, so here's an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">example of a fast distraction. This is my, now I would say world famous, Jesse, at this point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">illustration of the Twitter T.

Twitter scrolling is a great example of a fast distraction because it plays on our human</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">attraction to ideas, and in particular, ideas that tend to support our group or tribe against</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">perceived enemies. But when you're encountering these ideas on Twitter, they're cursory,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">they're short, they're devoid of contact. So they don't really require you to load up or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">interrogate your understanding of any part of the world in any detail. They surf by on a shallow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">wave of emotions. You get the simulacrum of being exposed to ideas and intellectual combat,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but you don't actually have to do much cognition. Now let's compare this, I'll draw on the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">side here. Compare this to reading a polemical nonfiction book written by someone who knows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">what they're talking about. Expert illustration over here of a book. There we go. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Compare these two things. So when you're reading a book on, and I'm saying polemical books,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, I'm making an argument here. Here's a my take on something. I'm an expert author,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm reading, I'm writing this book. This also plays on the same basic human instinct that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Twitter draws upon. We're interested in ideas and ideas that support our group perhaps against</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">others, but it's doing so in the book form in a slower way. We get into the book and the chapters,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the ideas are being developed more slowly. Over time, we load up in our mind, our mental structure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">on which our understanding of those topics currently rest. We interrogate it, we update it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a slower, more deeper intellectual process. It's instigated by the same human interest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">ideas, tribes, but the intellectual engagement is much deeper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, let's do another example here so we can get better at this distinction. I'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">erase my beautiful artwork from before.

All right. So what I'm going to draw here as a example of a fast distraction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is clearly a phone, right?

So it's like, OK, this person is dancing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">demonstrably.

That's kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">what it's like to connect with someone.

As a stay-at-home parent of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1634" target="_blank">00:27:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">young child, I have the opportunity to get some work done, some deep work done in the afternoon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1638" target="_blank">00:27:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">when my child sleeps. But afternoons are when I'm usually groggy despite having gotten a good night's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1643" target="_blank">00:27:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">sleep, and so I fail to get much done. I'd love to be more productive during those valuable hours</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1648" target="_blank">00:27:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">without resorting to caffeine. Thoughts? So Jesse, it's not going to seem apparent at first,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1655" target="_blank">00:27:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but this is going to end up being our stealth slow productivity corner question of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1660" target="_blank">00:27:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the one question of each episode where the answer will have something to do with my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1671" target="_blank">00:27:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">upcoming book, Slow Productivity, which comes out March 5th.

All right. So at first, this question seems to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1683" target="_blank">00:28:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">unrelated to slow productivity, but I'm going to drive it there by the end of my answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1689" target="_blank">00:28:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So I'm going to start by doing my sort of pedantic semantic policing here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1696" target="_blank">00:28:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you're probably using the word deep work incorrectly. So again, deep work is very narrow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1704" target="_blank">00:28:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It refers to professional activities that are cognitively demanding,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1709" target="_blank">00:28:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and it refers to approaching those activities without context switching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1714" target="_blank">00:28:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So instead of switching back and forth between that activity and other things like email and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1719" target="_blank">00:28:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Slack, I'll give it my full attention. By giving cognitive demanding professional tasks your full</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1724" target="_blank">00:28:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">attention, you're able to accomplish it faster and a higher level of quality than to approach it with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1728" target="_blank">00:28:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">divided attention. Now, I'm assuming because you use the terminology stay at home parent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1734" target="_blank">00:28:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you're not also working a job. So it's not like you're trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1737" target="_blank">00:28:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">balance an unrelated knowledge work job with deep work requirements with being at home and caring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1745" target="_blank">00:29:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">for a child. So probably what I'm assuming you're referring to is just important work. You have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1750" target="_blank">00:29:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">things that need to get done. And when you get to the afternoon, which seems like the right time to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1755" target="_blank">00:29:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of get things done and make a real push through your task list, you find that you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1760" target="_blank">00:29:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">tired, which, by the way, I'm not surprised by young children are incredibly tiring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1765" target="_blank">00:29:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So what can we do about that? Let me start with a couple of practical suggestions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1771" target="_blank">00:29:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and then I'm going to give you a slow answer as well. Find more ways to get things done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1775" target="_blank">00:29:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in the morning when your energy is higher, even though your kid is around. So especially with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1781" target="_blank">00:29:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">first kids, there's this idea that, look, they need to be constantly entertained.

By the time you have two or three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1792" target="_blank">00:29:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">kids like I do, your standards there really start to go down. There's probably certain types of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1798" target="_blank">00:29:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">things at certain times in the morning when you can get that done. OK, so we have breakfast and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1802" target="_blank">00:30:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">after breakfast, he or she watches some Bluey. And that's when I, you know, check up on email</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1808" target="_blank">00:30:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">or that's when I build the, you know, the grocery list or whatever it is. So there's there's ways</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1814" target="_blank">00:30:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you can integrate more work.

All right, here's something kind of simple I can do. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1849" target="_blank">00:30:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of automated.

It doesn't require a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">concentration. So you don't leave the more complicated stuff for the afternoon. And finally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">arrange for more time off.

Slower in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2781" target="_blank">00:46:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">case was probably better. So you don't always want things to explode. You want it to last,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2787" target="_blank">00:46:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and that can be different. All right. Let's do one more question. What do we got?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2793" target="_blank">00:46:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Next question is from Deep Mountains. I abandoned social media, but now I feel left out and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2798" target="_blank">00:46:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">forgotten. Since I now barely have an online existence, people tend to make plans that don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2803" target="_blank">00:46:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">include me. And when I do send somebody a message to arrange a meetup, my energy gets sapped waiting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2808" target="_blank">00:46:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">for the replies. Most of my friends communicate through social media. So my old way of communicating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2814" target="_blank">00:46:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">gets lost. How can I still live a meaningful social life with this quandary? So what do you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2821" target="_blank">00:47:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">think, I don't know if it's a he or she, let's say he, what do you think he means by his friends</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2829" target="_blank">00:47:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">make plans mainly using social media? What tool is he talking about? Because he separates out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2836" target="_blank">00:47:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">messaging, which he does do. Well, you can message on Instagram. I think a lot of people do that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2840" target="_blank">00:47:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">especially young people. So like using Instagram instead of like iMessage or WhatsApp. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2848" target="_blank">00:47:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Using the communication within those apps. I know that like with our guys, my coach,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2854" target="_blank">00:47:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like in high school, they use instant Instagram messaging a lot. Okay. And this, is this different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2862" target="_blank">00:47:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">than it is DM Twitter? That's DM. Or it's Instagram DM as well. DMing is... Direct messaging. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2870" target="_blank">00:47:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Instagram. Right. Okay. So it's like a main way. It's why like a lot of people... And I could see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2877" target="_blank">00:47:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">parties and stuff like that being announced there, especially on Facebook. Like they,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2881" target="_blank">00:48:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">people would invite people more our age, but I bet you people use a lot Facebook to make plans and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2888" target="_blank">00:48:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">invitations, stuff like that. So Instagram does this. TikTok is not a social network, right? So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2894" target="_blank">00:48:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not TikTok. There you're seeing stuff the algorithm shows, but Facebook, Instagram,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2899" target="_blank">00:48:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe Twitter, or probably not as much anymore like Instagram. Okay. So I think my thought here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2907" target="_blank">00:48:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is okay. Perfectly fine use for social media. I mean, if your friends are using a messaging feature</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2914" target="_blank">00:48:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of let's say Instagram to meet up, then use the messaging feature on Instagram to meet up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=2921" target="_blank">00:48:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Just don't use Instagram in other ways.

It has over 1.5 million views. And so I thought we would take a look. For those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3853" target="_blank">01:04:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">who are watching instead of just listening, I have it loaded up on the screen here in the corner with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3861" target="_blank">01:04:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the closed captioning. So the title of this YouTube video is I'm a 33-year-old woman with no life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3869" target="_blank">01:04:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">My advice to young women. So we have a young woman talking straight to camera. Here I'll read the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3874" target="_blank">01:04:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">closed caption of the beginning. I want to give you some advice on how to deal with this and cope</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3881" target="_blank">01:04:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">with no sense of direction. But for now, I kind of want to just tell you my story of how I got here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3886" target="_blank">01:04:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not long and it's not that sad. All right. So then we get a story from this person talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3893" target="_blank">01:04:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">straight to camera about why she is now 33 years old and feels like she has no life. So let me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3900" target="_blank">01:05:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">summarize. I took some notes here. Let me summarize the story that she tells. Coming out of college,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3906" target="_blank">01:05:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">she was interested in digital media, got a good internship in digital media. But then when she</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3913" target="_blank">01:05:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">applied for what she described as fun media department jobs, she didn't get them. They kept</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3920" target="_blank">01:05:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">saying, no, you don't have enough experience. And so not able to get those jobs she desired,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3925" target="_blank">01:05:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">she fell back and said, I'll just do retail. So she fell back for retail jobs. Some time passed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3933" target="_blank">01:05:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">an opportunity came up for her to get a quote, good project manager job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3938" target="_blank">01:05:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a job with benefits, normal salary. I think this was out west.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3944" target="_blank">01:05:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But then after a little while, she got fired and has no jobs. As she says, it was so devastating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3950" target="_blank">01:05:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It's back like she was when she was looking for her original jobs after her internship. She's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3956" target="_blank">01:05:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">having a hard time finding a solid job. She did some contract work for about eight months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3960" target="_blank">01:06:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But now she says, no, it feels like no one wants to hire me. No one wants anything to do with me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3964" target="_blank">01:06:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">because they feel like she doesn't have the right experience. It seems like her new plan,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3971" target="_blank">01:06:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">based on what she says in this video, is to make content for YouTube and hope maybe that works out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3976" target="_blank">01:06:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So this is a couple of things I want to talk about here. First of all, I want to say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3982" target="_blank">01:06:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">this is a useful type of video to exist. I think having people actually talk about the realities</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3990" target="_blank">01:06:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of their engagement with the world of work is really useful because we don't really get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=3995" target="_blank">01:06:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">a clear picture, especially young people. They don't get a really clear picture about how this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4001" target="_blank">01:06:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">works. You have sort of abstract books, maybe. And then you have this the typical YouTube, TikTok</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4008" target="_blank">01:06:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">presentation of work, where it's usually a lot of people who make a living on YouTube and TikTok</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4013" target="_blank">01:06:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of talk about how they make a living on YouTube and TikTok. And then maybe you get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4017" target="_blank">01:06:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">exposed to some sort of celebrity workers, you know, famous writers and artists and sports stars,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4026" target="_blank">01:07:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this type of thing. That's kind of it. So we don't really get exposed to a lot of the reality</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4031" target="_blank">01:07:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of how the world of work works and what to expect and how hard it can be and how emotionally hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4038" target="_blank">01:07:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it can be. And so to see that and have someone just say it straight to camera, no holds barred,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4044" target="_blank">01:07:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I think is really important. Oh, this is how the world of work can work for most people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4049" target="_blank">01:07:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's really hard. And if you're feeling emotionally drained by your difficulty in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4053" target="_blank">01:07:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">world of work, instead of feeling like you're an outlier, you watch a video like this, you say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4057" target="_blank">01:07:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, this is I'm not alone. Work is hard. We just don't hear those stories. Those stories</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4062" target="_blank">01:07:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">don't get amplified. Second, however, I think this video is a good reason to revisit some ideas from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4070" target="_blank">01:07:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">my 2012 book, So Good They Can't Ignore You. I think in addition to being a useful window into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4077" target="_blank">01:07:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the reality of the world of work, this video also gives a reality, a window into the reality of how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4084" target="_blank">01:08:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of people, she's a young millennial, but Gen Z probably feels the same way, but especially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4089" target="_blank">01:08:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">millennials, just when we were raised, it gives a window into some of the issues with how we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4094" target="_blank">01:08:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">think about work. So the model that comes out of this video, at least this was my impression,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4099" target="_blank">01:08:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">was a model of work in which you figured out what you want to do, digital media, whatever it is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4108" target="_blank">01:08:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you wait to get chosen to do it. So then someone chooses you, say, okay, I will let you come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4114" target="_blank">01:08:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and do this for my company. They choose you to do it. So it's like getting into college,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4118" target="_blank">01:08:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Getting accepted into graduate school. And then you're good. I got chosen. I put out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4124" target="_blank">01:08:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">my applications and someone said, I choose you. You get to come into this world now and be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4128" target="_blank">01:08:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">digital media, whatever. And if that doesn't happen, then you're kind of lost. So you figure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4134" target="_blank">01:08:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">out what you want to do. You put yourself out there, hey, can I come do this for you? And either</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4139" target="_blank">01:08:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">they say yes, and you're happy, or they say no. And then you really can end up in a hard situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4146" target="_blank">01:09:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What's the alternative model to think about this? Well, it's the model from my book, So Good They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4151" target="_blank">01:09:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Can't Ignore You, which is based on career capital. It says the whole job industry, the whole job</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4157" target="_blank">01:09:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">market, it's all about what do you have to offer specifically that's valuable. And the collection</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4163" target="_blank">01:09:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of your rare and valuable skills, your skills that are rare and valuable to the market in general is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4168" target="_blank">01:09:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">what we call career capital.

And therefore, the whole game, especially right out of college, is building career capital</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRlY_GSxc&t=4176" target="_blank">01:09:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">as quickly as possible.
