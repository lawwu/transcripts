They go to the website often.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY71PSPJfOc&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But they've never thought about the fact that, yeah, it takes a lot of money to do big scale ministry like what we do at Desiring God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY71PSPJfOc&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So what would you say to somebody who has been a consumer of the content and now maybe they have the means to give a recurring gift,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY71PSPJfOc&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe a small gift, $20 a month or whatever it is, whatever the coffee budget is, what would you say to them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY71PSPJfOc&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Totally. I think that Desiring God is an amazing resource.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY71PSPJfOc&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We live in a very special time in which the Internet has afforded us the ability to connect to a resource of this type,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY71PSPJfOc&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of its quality, but also its breadth and depth. We should be doing everything we can as people who enjoy it to extend it and spread it to as many other people as possible while we can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY71PSPJfOc&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, you know, no technology is guaranteed forever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY71PSPJfOc&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And this window of access, we should be doing the most to, you know, kind of reach the ends of the earth, as you will, with this opportunity and these resources.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY71PSPJfOc&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So I would say support, not just for the opportunity of supporting, but also like the blessing of knowing that dollars are going to something that is 100 percent of positive value to the world and to others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY71PSPJfOc&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way DG is managed and how funds are used are like incredibly above board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY71PSPJfOc&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Like as far as ministries go, the ethics and the stewardship is off the charts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY71PSPJfOc&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Good.

complete lack of friction to those resources is very special and very unique.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY71PSPJfOc&t=867"

encouraging one another to take the most of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY71PSPJfOc&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.320</a></span> | <span
