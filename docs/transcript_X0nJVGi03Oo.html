It's just if you're paying that rent, you might as well be earning points and Built points are fantastic. They have amazing transfer partners. Like I would trade my Amex points for Built points if that was an option. But you don't actually need the Built card to use Built points program.</p><p>In fact, you can join Built Rewards for free and start earning points through all the various other things they do. They partner with tons of restaurants. So there's a bunch of great restaurants in the Bay Area and I'm sure in almost every city where when you dine out at that restaurant, using any credit card you have, you can end up earning any plus 2, plus 3, plus 4 Built points on top of that.</p><p>They have a bunch of partnerships with places like SoulCycle. They have a partnership with Lyft. If you refer someone who opens up a Built card, you get Built points. So there are a lot of reasons to join the Built Rewards program. And I think it's pretty reasonable to rack up Built points without even having the Built</p></div></div></body></html>
