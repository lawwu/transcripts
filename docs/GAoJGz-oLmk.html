which I enjoy but haven't been doing recently,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:04:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where for well over a decade now I've solicited my readers and listeners to send me interesting links or articles or pointers they thought I might enjoy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to open up the

go over some of the cooler things that people have sent me from around the Internet all about the quest to live deeper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, that's our plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's get started now with our deep dive, which I am calling work versus meaning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is something I've been thinking about a lot recently is the history of our, let's call it tumultuous maybe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">relationship between work and finding meaning in our lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been thinking through this history mainly in the American context going back to about the post-war period,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so starting in the 1950s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What I've done is I've put together a timeline of what I think are the major milestones in our culture's evolving thinking about work and meaning starting in the 1950s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're watching this episode on YouTube, so at youtube.com/calnewportmedia,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to see this timeline on the screen right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're just listening, don't worry, I'll walk you through what's on here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first element of this timeline is the 1950s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the 1950s, I call this the "organization man" period,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which I describe as the period in which work is a substitute for civic life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we look at this immediate post-war period, what you see is a move away post-war from urban living,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">as well as let's say rural countryside, agriculture-related living, much more of the rise of suburban living.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So as that occurred, people began looking towards their employers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which at this point were typically very large.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We had the rise of the very large corporation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The US had emerged as a superpower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Our country and economy had not been destroyed by war,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so we had this 20-year period of just basically dominating every sector.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have these giant companies rising, these giant headquarters,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and people moving to the suburbs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the meaning they might have found before being involved in, let's say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">civic leadership of the small town where they had a farm got transferred over to "my work is my family,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"I'm very loyal to the company that I work for,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"I will be there for my entire career."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I see this period as an expression of civic identity through work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the way we were thinking about work then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we move to the 1960s, and we get the first backlash.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we did the 1950s, so now we get to the 1960s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We get the first backlash, which I call the counterculture backlash.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is what we see in the beat movement followed by the hippie movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way I describe this is work is now conceived as an obstacle to meaning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the younger generation, the children of World War II,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the children of the greatest generation, so what's known as the baby boom generation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of had enough of this idea of the man in the flannel suit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or organization man concept of, "I go and work at IBM my whole life,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and this is where I get a big sense of my civic meaning."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we get in the 1960s a backlash in which work is seen as an obstacle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to really figuring out meaningful lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we had a lot more individualistic, utopian lifestyle experimentation happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is where we had radical changes, let's say, in dress and attire,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.000</a></span> | <span

class="t">We had communes, the back to nature movement, the voluntary simplicity movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So everything we associate with that Woodstock generation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm conceiving now my sort of simplified trajectory here</span></div><div

period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so we're moving right along.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now we get to the 1990s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is when the older millennials like me or Jesse are in elementary school</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and junior high and high school, so sort of a formidable period</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=523"

I don't know, not really 30 years. I see the counterculture backlash picked up steam in the mid 60s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=1553" target="_blank">00:25:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you had the beat movement emerging in the late 50s. That doesn't really start to catch on wider until the 60s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=1559" target="_blank">00:25:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Mid 60s, you get the bigger countercultural backlash. Vietnam, of course, like explodes the whole thing because now you have this huge sort of generational divide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=1568" target="_blank">00:26:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and protests going on. But I think by the disco era that had kind of flamed out. I mean, a few things happened, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, sexually transmitted diseases, drugs, like the people started having LSD freak outs, like the things were happening with the drugs that weren't happening before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=1588" target="_blank">00:26:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that was that became a big part of it. Like people were burning out and frying out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=1592" target="_blank">00:26:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so by the disco era, by the late 70s, that was really dying out. And in the 80s, you got this sort of rise of let's all go make money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=1602" target="_blank">00:26:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was going on. And then, but it was the same. It was the same generation. The yuppies were the same people who were part of the counterculture backlash.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=1610" target="_blank">00:26:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they kind of ended up going and making money. And I think they were guilty about this. So for us, they taught us, well, don't be a hippie, but get a job you love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I really think that was just the compromise. And I wrote a whole book. So if you're new to the show or new to me, my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You is a takedown of the passion culture idea,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=1628" target="_blank">00:27:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">why it doesn't work, why just telling someone to follow your passion is not a sound bit of career advice. It sounded good, but it doesn't work in practice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=1638" target="_blank">00:27:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there could be something else new, but I think there's a lot of power to this work as a means to an end model. And I haven't really seen a major alternative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=1648" target="_blank">00:27:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of the stuff I'm seeing that's gaining traction, people resonating with people is really still in this framework. I think people are just refining it, trying to understand how do we get away from, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=1658" target="_blank">00:27:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">computer engineers doing spreadsheets about their admiral shares in Vanguard and what their overhead fees are and get towards something that the rest of us might actually see as viable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=1670" target="_blank">00:27:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, well, yes, we got a big block of questions coming up, including we're going to right off the bat have a question that's going to get technical about some of these issues we just talked about in the deep dive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=1680" target="_blank">00:28:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">First, I want to mention one of the sponsors, though, that makes this show possible.

So now what this allows you to do is if you're interested in a book, listen or read the blink first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=1758" target="_blank">00:29:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Get the lay of the land, figure out what this thing is about, what are the main ideas, and then you can make your decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, this is not what I thought it was, or it is what I thought it is.

And then you buy that book and the book that arrives is one that you are actually going to get through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=1777" target="_blank">00:29:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's really how I pitch Blinkist as a way to navigate yourself through the reading life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=1785" target="_blank">00:29:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So a couple of interesting things that have happened with Blinkist, they now have shortcasts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=1790" target="_blank">00:29:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So summaries of long form podcast as podcasts get longer, this makes a lot of sense.

What should I call these three properties? Three properties of a job income.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=2207" target="_blank">00:36:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How much income it generates location, so you're thinking about where you're where you're living and work type.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=2215" target="_blank">00:36:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Which can include both the content, the specifics of what you're doing, but also the parameters under which you're doing this work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=2222" target="_blank">00:37:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So flexibility, number of hours you're actually working. So for each of these three properties, income, location and work type, you want to answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=2230" target="_blank">00:37:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What would I need for each of these three properties in my job to support this big vision I had?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=2237" target="_blank">00:37:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have this big vision.

What type and how much work would I be doing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=2246" target="_blank">00:37:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you answered those three questions. Now you have the specificity you need to go search for a job because now you're thinking about, OK, now I need to find a job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=2256" target="_blank">00:37:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That is going to get me those three properties or perhaps more realistically, if you're just coming out of school, will get me to those three properties.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=2265" target="_blank">00:37:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If over the first five years or 10 years I get after it becomes so good, it can't be ignored. Build up career capital.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=2272" target="_blank">00:37:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The answers to those three questions I'm going to propose is the bridge from a broad vision to a specific choice of job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=2279" target="_blank">00:37:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me give an example. I was working on my my slow productivity book this morning as I do every morning, six days a week I work on my book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=2287" target="_blank">00:38:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But today I was working on a chapter and I was talking about in that chapter, the entrepreneur Paul Jarvis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=2296" target="_blank">00:38:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I went on a Paul Jarvis deep dive, a sort of rabbit hole this morning.

that does not pull from your prefrontal cortex,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=2925" target="_blank">00:48:45.000</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=2933" target="_blank">00:48:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">planning that that smarter part of your brain has an easier job concentrating or has

target="_blank">00:49:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a repetitive physical activity that's not heavily pulling apart on that sort of inner dialogue,</span></div><div class="c"><span

very difficult not to be focused on all these things that are developing or potentially coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=3513" target="_blank">00:58:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've noted, like, I kind of miss the just extended, gracious enjoyment of the moment that I've had at other parts of my

target="_blank">00:58:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, I'm enjoying the spring sun, you know, by the Charles and reading a copy of Thoreau.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=3536" target="_blank">00:58:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think also there's probably more anxiety in that period.</span></div><div

now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=3558" target="_blank">00:59:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they have their

not planning, even if it's exciting, I'm not going to do any more planning thoughts about a new segment for the show or what's going to happen with this new book challenge.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=3632" target="_blank">01:00:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's like a muscle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

cross country ski to the hospital.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=3709" target="_blank">01:01:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you would see them, not like tons of them, but there's at least one or two doctors we knew that would cross country ski down to the hospital.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=3716" target="_blank">01:01:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyways, he was living there and then he hit it big with his whatever his first

So you can just endlessly create new documents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=4852" target="_blank">01:20:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">put whatever you want in them, organize them in folders over on the over on the sidebar and just pull up whatever you need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=4857" target="_blank">01:20:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and edit whatever you need on one side of your screen while you write on the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=4861" target="_blank">01:21:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you think of something off topic while you're writing, you put it in there and then you bring it over to the working memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=4867" target="_blank">01:21:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, oh, yeah.

We have one more segment in the show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=5024" target="_blank">01:23:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is the mailbag segment is going to be a segment where I open up my interesting CalNewport.com mailbag and go through a few things that have come in from you, my listeners recently that I think are interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=5035" target="_blank">01:23:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Before we do, let me just briefly mention another one of the sponsors that makes this show possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=5040" target="_blank">01:24:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is Wren. W-R-E-N. Wren is a startup that's making it easy for everyone to make a meaningful difference in the climate crisis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=5051" target="_blank">01:24:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of different efforts required to try to understand and improve our relationship with the environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=5058" target="_blank">01:24:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's big legal efforts and political efforts and systemic efforts and international treaties and all that's important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=5064" target="_blank">01:24:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's also the question of what can I do right now while all of that is being fought out at above my pay grade in the halls of legislatures and international committees?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=5074" target="_blank">01:24:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, you can go to Wren.

There's a humanist core to this beyond just isn't that crazy?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=5987" target="_blank">01:39:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Someone skipped the stone, whatever it was like one hundred twenty eight meters or something crazy like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=5993" target="_blank">01:39:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a long form article and I recommend it.

It was still the focal point of someone escaping the fog of mental health issues and finding some peace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=6054" target="_blank">01:40:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think there is a general point there. You don't have to retreat into rural Pennsylvania, become a professional stone skipper,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=6060" target="_blank">01:41:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but don't sleep on the importance of having an organizing target for your energies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=6065" target="_blank">01:41:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think this article, which is beautifully written and beautifully photographed. So well done, Sean Williams, is a great case study of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoJGz-oLmk&t=6073" target="_blank">01:41:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, again, thank you, listeners, for sending that in.
