My name is Josh Ruchite and today on the show I am thrilled to welcome back my friend and business partner, he of the Watchman Privacy Platform, Gabriel Custodiate.</p><p>Gabriel, welcome back to the show for the bazillionth time. Hey Josh, how's it going? Very well, sir, very well. So we are here to do a little bit of promotion. You and I have collaborated now on, I guess it's been about three different projects, three different courses that we have done.</p><p>We've had a lot of students go through them, a lot of great feedback, and we're updating them and we are putting them on sale today. So we didn't do a ton of planning before this episode. Where do you want to begin? Yeah, so let's just give them the lay of the land here.</p><p>It seems like three courses. It's been two. We have the BitcoinPrivacyCourse.com and the HackProofCourse.com. These were going to be 50% off basically for the rest of November. So 50% off for both of those courses. You should definitely go pick up both of those. We'll have links in the show notes, in the description.</p><p>You can also, from one of them, click on the profile and get to the other. But that's kind of the main thing. All of November, they're going to be 50% off. And I want to say something to the audience, and I love your audience. I love my audience. I want to say this.</p><p>So we see these statistics and we know that not everyone who follows radical personal finance has purchased, in this case, let's talk about the Bitcoin Privacy Course. That's one of our favorites. And to me, that's not an acceptable statistic, especially if you care about your finances and your future.</p><p>So we're trying to help you. And I was trying to think, what would be the turnoffs for people? And so I understand if some people think that, let's say, Bitcoin and crypto are beyond their abilities. But in the course, we explain Bitcoin at a step-by-step level. We don't miss the forest for the trees.</p><p>We don't get overly complicated. There's an introductory element to the course, and I'm showing you on screen everything I'm doing. And of course, lack of knowledge is not an excuse to avoid the greatest monetary freedom tool ever created. And that's a conclusion that I've arrived at for Bitcoin in the last couple of years of studying this and writing a book on it that's coming out soon.</p><p>So others of you, and I'm speaking again to you, audience, I'm speaking to you, John and Natalie and Robert, who's driving in the car right now. If you think that you already have it figured out, probably there's a few of you, right? But I want to tell you that owning Bitcoin and Coinbase is not owning Bitcoin.</p><p>You don't own Bitcoin if you have it through Coinbase or Swan or any other exchange. In fact, you're more in danger if you own Bitcoin and Coinbase than if you didn't own any Bitcoin. You're KYC, that stands for know your customer. You've been slapped with the mark of the beast, even though you thought you were avoiding it.</p><p>You've been deceived about what Bitcoin ownership actually is. So we talked about in this course about how to get actual Bitcoin, private Bitcoin, and privately that you yourself can possess without any intermediary. So finally, I would say there's probably two other groups of people who are kind of hesitant to get into Bitcoin.</p><p>And the first one is maybe you're just not interested for some reason, and I think you should be. And the other is people who think Bitcoin is a scam because they listen to Peter Schiff and they told him so. He told him so. And what I'll say is Bitcoin has been going on for 14 years now.</p><p>14 years ago, it was set into motion and it has been going ever since. And it has had at certain times a $1 trillion bounty to hack Bitcoin. And of course, it has not been hacked, not even close. It is not going to be hacked. It's a fabulous tool.</p><p>So it's not going anywhere. It works today. I'm not talking about investment or speculation. Of course, if you want to do that, you can. I'm talking about as a freedom tool. I can use Bitcoin today to buy pretty much most essential things I want in the world. I can send Bitcoin to someone else anywhere in the world, any amount, and it's going to get to them in a reasonable amount of time with no possibility of censorship.</p><p>That is amazing. That is astounding. That is the strongest property, as some people have noted, that you can have in the world today. So Bitcoin is digital money and it's widely accepted now and it simply works. So I respect Peter Schiff's economics and I understand his critique of blind speculation in Bitcoin, like products, but nothing he says about actual Bitcoin should be a reason to discourage you.</p><p>So maybe you're a gold bug, right? And I'll say, try transporting gold around the world in the case of an emergency. I took a domestic flight with some pieces of silver a few months ago, and just that, they took me inside for interrogation, right? If you think that gold is going to help you during an emergency situation where you have to escape the country or something, it's not going to happen.</p><p>Bitcoin is going to happen, right? When you have a Bitcoin seed phrase, which is 12 words, you have that in your head, you walk anywhere on earth, you type it into a computer on the other side and you have access to that. So I need you to understand how powerful of a privacy tool this is.</p><p>Everyone listening right now needs to be in this course. It's 50% off right now. There's nothing like it on the internet. I listened and I read for hundreds of hours in preparation of this. Nobody explained it in the basic pared down way that I did. I think it's fabulous.</p><p>And I think all of you should definitely be in the Bitcoin course. We also have a hack proof course, which I won't explain in too much detail, but it helps you to avoid being part of the $10 trillion cybercrime statistic, which you will inevitably be in if you don't take the necessary steps to do so.</p><p>So those are our two courses. And I think everyone should be in both of them. Yeah, 100% agree. On the on our Bitcoin course right now, we have a 96% five star rating and a 4% four star rating and no ones, twos and threes. And I don't think we've had a single unhappy customer.</p><p>Do you remember anyone? I don't I don't think we've had a single request for refund or anything like that. Or like that. Correct? No. Yeah, no, we don't. And we're checking email and I'm taking the feedback all the time. So people send me questions sometimes and I just answer them.</p><p>So that's kind of who we are. We're not some weird corporate giant. We're not we're going to send you in a loop. We're here to sell you something if you don't want it, we refund it. And if you need some help, I'm often willing to help you. So that's how it goes.</p><p>Yeah, it's fantastic. And we take people from a zero knowledge base to everything you need to know how to clean up your devices, how to get proper wallets, how to own it, how to buy it, how to use it, etc. It's fantastic. So BitcoinPrivacyCourse.com use coupon code BlackFriday50. Black Friday 50 in order to save 50% here during the month of November.</p><p>I don't want to skip over HackProof course, though. What do you want to say about that, Gabriel? Yeah, so the HackProof course, for whatever reason, wasn't as interesting to people as the Bitcoin course. And I understand that. But look, I talk to people all the time. And I talk to friends and family who have been scammed.</p><p>I have great operational security. I still get all these scam emails all the time. And all it takes is one click and one type in of your login credentials and boom, you're out $50 or $100. We're selling this course for around $50 after the discount. And this is knowledge that will help you lock down dozens, if not hundreds of aspects of your life, teach you how to recognize scams, avoid them by email, by phone call, how to protect yourself against identity theft, protect you against getting your accounts hacked.</p><p>This is, again, a four hour course that is essential. Like anybody who uses the internet needs to understand this stuff. And just like the Bitcoin course, I tried to pare it down as best I can in a way that a lot of people, to be honest, don't talk about.</p><p>They don't understand that these things at the kind of fundamental level that I tried to explain it up. So that's hackproofcourse.com also 50% off. And if you want to be part of the $10 trillion cybercrime industry statistics, keep doing what you're doing. If you don't want to, then go buy this course and listen to it and learn from it.</p><p>Yeah. One of my new year's resolutions, I've done okay, better than most people, not as good as you, but one of my new year's resolutions for this next year, one of my plans. Throughout the year is I'm going to systematically fix a few of the holes in my own, in my own structure.</p><p>I let a few holes open up just due to neglect on a couple of different things. And I'm going to be going through systematically this next year and fixing that. Like I said, the course, when it's 50% off, we normally sell the course for $97. When it's 50% off, it's less than 50 bucks.</p><p>Bitcoin course, we normally sell it right now for $139, 50% off. It's 70 bucks. So buy those right now. Bitcoin privacy course.com, hackproof course.com. Anything else you want to add Gabriel? I think your point about new year's resolutions is great. These are excellent new year's resolutions. Do you want to own something, a monetary tool that is more resilient than any other monetary tool out there?</p><p>You can learn how to do that. Or if you want to learn how to become a better cyber citizen and protected from all this craziness out in the world that I see all the time, and I'm sure you do too, if you would just pay a little bit of attention and take some preemptive steps to fight against it.</p><p>So these are great new year's resolutions. This is the time to buy them at a discounted rate and prepare for the new year so you can implement some of these things to change your life in a monetary and a hack proofing way. Absolutely. Anything else? That's it for me.</p><p>Hope to see you guys in the course. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. the course.</p></div></div></body></html>
