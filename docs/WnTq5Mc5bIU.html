target="_blank">00:02:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">dealing with the fact that you have to kind of retrain an operator</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to kind of take these calls, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, um, the, the kind of, the big challenge here is that-</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I had a nice slide to show you, uh,</span></div><div

call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what you can do right now is imagine the worst,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">most complicated, uh, enterprise UI screen that you have ever seen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, just the worst, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, uh, it's, it's like, it's got like 15 tabs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and so as you're filling data here on the call,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">you've got to switch a tab, go to the next tab,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">then fill up another screen, uh, fill up some more data there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, so it's, it's a, it's a, it's a pretty kind of nightmarish situation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">for the operator who's trying to fill this data up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the, the big kind of challenge is, is that it's, it's not just kind of navigating this UI and filling up this data,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.100</a></span> | <span class="t">but what it kind of comes down to is you have to figure out what the right procedure code is for that patient</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">before you schedule them in, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And different kinds of, uh, situations will require different kinds of medical procedure codes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, you might have, like, uh, mammogram with ultrasound urinal, or bilateral, or with, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">with an ultrasound also, uh, baked in, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, but maybe they need wheelchair assistance, and so that code becomes a different, like, it becomes M-M-1-2-3-W-A, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it, it changes, and the number of codes change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not just dependent on the patient that, when they come in, and the patient's kind of symptoms, and age, and gender, and stuff like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">but also whether the patient had already come to the clinic before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, it also depends on state regulation, federal regulation, and local regulation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It also depends on if the clinic decides that they don't like to work after 3 p.m.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, then you can't, you can't schedule an appointment for that particular clinic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, the number of permutations and combinations that are required, uh, is, is kind of explosive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, the last bit of it that makes it really shitty, even, is that nobody even agrees on the same set of procedure codes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=279"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, and then let's figure out how, uh, what, you know, what the right kind of time for them to, uh, schedule the appointment is and stuff like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, in this kind of situation, um, in these kind of three players, right, uh, you, you have this, this administrator, right, for every clinic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.300</a></span> | <span class="t">who's a non-technical person,

<span class="t">So they know, they know everything, but the problem is they can't really build it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So, so you have kind of this config explosion problem, or you have a, and you have a training burden, which is that every time you increase configuration,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.380</a></span> | <span class="t">you've got to train the, uh, you've got to train the operators to do more with that configuration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">You have a lot of uncoded rules and business logic that people don't want to code up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, nobody wants to code up a situation of, like, this clinic in Chicago doesn't like to work on a Friday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it's not a thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, um, well, I, it's probably, like, the Bay Area, I guess, but not, not Chicago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, um, and then, of course, the, the, what this nets out to saying is that every time you encode a new rule, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">it's, it's, it's more expensive than the benefit that you get, so, you know, we just, we just kind of offload this training to operators, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and this leads to what I call kind of the automation paradox, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So the automation paradox is the people who understand the rules can't code the automation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and the people who can code the automation, uh, can't understand the rules.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, can't, don't, won't, whatever, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, they, they, developers, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.220</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't, they don't want to go out into the field and do real work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">They're like, oh, let me, let me, by code something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so the AI idea, unsurprisingly, this is going to be a shocker for you guys, is what if the non-tech people could write and update, uh, these algorithms in natural language, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what does it take to make that happen, so that we can kind of cut the developer out of the loop and just have admins,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Vibe code, in production, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.700</a></span> | <span class="t">What does it take for us to get there, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's kind of what we've been working on, uh, for the last, uh, for the last few months, uh, and I kind of want to share with you what, uh, what we've done, uh, uh, and I have, I have a live demo as well, but the internet is janky, so I'm gonna play a recorded thing that I was just doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">in the corner, quickly recording it first, so that, so that you can then see it, okay, cool, all right, so the challenges, the first challenge is what I call the language problem, and the language problem is essentially, the business user has a language that seems very obvious to them, and if you give this to, like, a stock LLM, um, it will result in, you know, maybe MRI machines catching fire when it is deployed, no, it won't actually happen, thankfully, thankfully we're not doing that work yet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.380</a></span> | <span class="t">yet, we're just starting another project where we're getting into that, but we're staying away from the actual scanning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.700</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, so, so won't actually catch, catch fire, but the problem is that the LLM does not speak your business language, it speaks your programming language, so you can meta,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">you can say do react-y things, or do rusty things, or do JavaScript-y things, uh, or TypeScript things, but, but you can't, um, but it's kind of hard to, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.700</a></span> | <span class="t">that specific terminology of what you want to do, and how it should work and translate your environment to intent is challenging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.900</a></span> | <span class="t">There are two other problems that I would say are kind of non-AI problems, but just, like, uh, very important things to set up, one is the DevOps problem, what even is the SDLC for a non-technical user, right, like, what is a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.020</a></span> | <span class="t">what is review, staging, production, uh, fixing, uh, troubleshooting when you're a non-technical user, right, like, that's kind of weird.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and the second is a security problem, which is so, uh, cool, we gave these non-technical users a way to, uh, write whatever business logic on the fly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.220</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, what if it causes a massive, uh, data breach, or a security leak, um, then, you know, might as well, might as well shut down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, so, so that's, that's kind of the stuff that needs to be opinionatedly, opinionatedly solved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool, alright, so, the solution. Now, um, the idea is, suppose you're a company called Acme, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">what, what people are kind of, what developers are doing today in this company called Acme, or for this, for this healthcare company,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.460</a></span> | <span class="t">is, um, developers have tribal knowledge and know-how, and they use that to talk to a foundation model, uh, with assisted tooling, etc.,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">depending on your tool of choice, and they generate, you know, uh, programs, and programs do things, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead of that, what if the non-technical user spoke to a model that was taught the language of your domain instead,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and that would generate, let's call, let's call it Acme QL, uh, surprise, prompt QL, which is then coming,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Acme, whatever, company QL, but, um, uh, let's say it generates a language in, it generates this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">it generates a plan in a language called company QL, and this company QL plan is a program, is like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">deterministic artifact that can actually be executed, so that's kind of the bridge between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.220</a></span> | <span class="t">the business user, the AI, and what actually gets executed, uh, deterministically, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">this is, uh, run, right?

And says, "Hey, so we identified, uh, analytics pipeline.py,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">this is the GitHub issue, uh, this is the, uh, sorry, that's not the repo, uh, yeah, that's the, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.940</a></span> | <span class="t">repo I'd set up for this is sample repo, right? So it has a bunch of files, uh, and now from this bunch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">of files, I want you to kind of go in and say, "Hey, uh, find the right issue, find the right file,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and from that file, find the top contributor," right? And so, uh, that top contributor gets found,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and I actually have confidence that, "Okay, this is sort of working. I've actually done this work myself."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">The next thing we do is introduce a primitive called automations. So automations is now primitive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">in this, uh, ACME QL, right? So I say, "Convert this to an automation." Um, and this is the only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">technical thing I deal with ever as a business user. I say, "Input has a field name called description,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and output should have a field called, uh, name. That's it. I kind of don't care. There's an input and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">there's an output, and I'm gonna stop thinking about what my business logic does." It then goes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.140</a></span> | <span class="t">ahead, converts it into an automation, runs a bunch of tests. If it sees the test, it fixes it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">does a whole bunch of things in the background, um, and then kind of gets to a place, uh, where it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.740</a></span> | <span class="t">returns, uh, a suggested user and what that user should be. And then I can go ahead and say, "Test this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.260</a></span> | <span class="t">with more input and output," right? So test this with these kinds of issues, like, "Oh, the database</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">is down," or "Data is down," or whatever users say, right? "Pods are not scaling down." This whenever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">traffic, whenever the traffic spike ends, uh, whatever kind of situation you have, right? And, and what this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">then does is, uh, it runs a bunch more tests, does that, and as soon as, uh, you're kind of satisfied with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">the result of that test, um, or not, uh, you decide to continue. In this case, I'm not satisfied because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I looked at Tom, and this is again the kind of stuff I'm not, I don't want to look at code, right? But I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">look at Tom, I'm like, "Tom doesn't sound like the right guy. Show me all the users and their emails."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I go in and see, uh, "Oh, Tom is from a different company. Uh, Tom is from a different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.460</a></span> | <span class="t">company, so I, I can't, I can't assign this to Tom, even though Tom is on our GitHub and is an external</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">contributor," right? And so then I kind of add in another rule saying, "Hey, uh, remove this somebody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=913" target="_blank">00:15:13.340</a></span> | <span class="t">else from an external company," right? And I keep modifying this automation, keep testing it, whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">As soon as that is done, as soon as that is done, I hit, uh, deploy. Uh, I hit, uh, deploy button here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">That's all I do as a non-technical person. Um, this is our stock UI, the UI that, uh, is, the UI is there for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">those field, uh, for the field folks, the risk admins, uh, is more specialized for them. Um, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">they go and deploy this code, and, uh, in the live demo that I would have showed you, I would have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.260</a></span> | <span class="t">showed you that if you, uh, have these kinds of, lots of different issues that I was doing, uh, things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.820</a></span> | <span class="t">like, uh, "Oh, data pipelines are corrupting data, uh, users get assigned," uh, and then when I say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=953" target="_blank">00:15:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">nonsense things like, "Give me a new feature real fast, real cheap," uh, I want to start assigning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to have a different, more complicated business rule, right? So I want to go in and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">"Hmm, in case," let me just skip to the end and say, uh, "In case there is a generic request,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, just change that to assign that to a default person," right? So I do this exclusion rule, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and after I check the exclusion rule, I say, "In case no relevant files are found, assigned to this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.460</a></span> | <span class="t">person," right? So I can keep adding these more and more business, I can add more business rules,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I can test, and I can deploy, and the whole system kind of works, because for me as a business user,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.940</a></span> | <span class="t">there's really no difference in working with data and shipping business logic on data,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">because if I can be confident that the business logic is working here, all I need is a guarantee</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.220</a></span> | <span class="t">that this works, uh, beyond, right? So, um, that's kind of roughly, uh, that's kind of roughly what this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">what this looks like. Um, from a security point of view, uh, the important thing is that the data layer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.700</a></span> | <span class="t">is the part which keeps it real, so you can have as much vibe coding as you want on the layers above</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.020</a></span> | <span class="t">that, so that there's no multi-tenant authorization rules, etc. So this AcmeQL plan is running strictly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=1022" target="_blank">00:17:02.620</a></span> | <span class="t">in user space, it's not actually running, uh, in data space. Um, the impact that we do this with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">procedure code selection and appointment selection, and that has a hundred million dollar impact plus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.220</a></span> | <span class="t">upwards for them that they're going to realize, uh, over the course of this year that they've already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnTq5Mc5bIU&t=1036" target="_blank">00:17:16.140</a></span> | <span class="t">started to.
