So let me actually go to my parts because Div is not here yet. So I'm sure many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of you have read this paper "Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models" from 2022. So I'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">briefly go through some of them. So basically an ability is emergent if it is present in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">large but not smaller models, and it would not have been directly predicted by extrapolating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">performance from smaller models. So you can think of performance, it's basically near</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">random until a certain threshold called a critical threshold, and then improves very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">heavily. This is known as a phase transition, and again, it would not have been extrapolated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">or predicted if you were to extend the curve of the performance of smaller models. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">more of a jump which we'll see later. So here's an example of few-shot prompting for many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">different tasks. For example, modular arithmetic, unscrambling words, different QA tasks, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">so forth. And you'll see that performance kind of jumps very heavily up until a certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">point. I believe the x-axis here is the number of training flops, which corresponds to basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">model scale. So you'll see in many cases around 10 to the 22 or 10 to the 23 training flops,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a massive exponential jump or increase in terms of model performance on these tasks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">which was not present on smaller scales. So it's quite unpredictable. And here are some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">examples of this occurring using augmented prompting strategies. So I'll be talking a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">bit later about chain of thought. But basically, these strategies improve the ability of getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">behavior from models on different tasks. So you see, for example, with chain of thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">reasoning, that's an emergent behavior that happens again around 10 to the 22 training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">flops. And without it, model performance on GSM 8K, which is a mathematics benchmark,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it doesn't really improve heavily. But chain of thought kind of leads to that emergent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">behavior or sudden increase in performance. And here's just the table from the paper,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">which has a bigger list of emergent abilities of LLMs, as well as their scale at which they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">occur. So I recommend that you check out the paper to learn a bit more. And so one thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">researchers have been wondering is, why does this emergence occur exactly? And even now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">there's few explanation for why that happens. And the authors also found that the evaluation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">metrics used to measure these abilities may not fully explain why they emerge, and suggest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">some alternative evaluation metrics, which I encourage you to read more in the paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So other than scaling up to encourage these emergent abilities, which could endow even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.700</a></span> | <span class="t">larger LLMs with further new emergent abilities, what else can be done? Well, things like investigating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">new architectures, higher quality data, which is very important for performance on all tasks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">improved training and improved training procedures could enable emergent abilities to occur,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">especially on smaller models, which is a current growing area of research, which I'll also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">talk about a bit more later. Other abilities include potentially improving the few-shot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">prompting abilities of LLMs, theoretical and interpretability research, again, to try to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">understand why emergent abilities is a thing and how we can maybe leverage that further,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">as well as maybe some computational linguistics work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So with these large models and emergent abilities, there's also risks, right? There's potential</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">societal risks, for example, truthfulness, bias, and toxicity risks. As emergent abilities</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">incentivizes further scaling up language models, for example, up to GPT-4 size or further.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">However, this may lead to bias increasing, as well as toxicity and the memorization of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">training data. That's one thing that these larger models are more potent at. And there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.280</a></span> | <span class="t">potential risks in future language models that have also not been discovered yet. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it's important that we approach this in a safe manner as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, emergent abilities and larger models have also led to sociological changes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">changes in the community's views and use of these models. Most importantly, it's led to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the development of general purpose models, which perform on a wide range of tasks, not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">just particular tasks it was trained for. For example, when you think of chat GPT, GPT-3.5,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">as well as GPT-4, there are more general purpose models, which work well across the board,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and can then be further adapted to different use cases, mainly through in context, prompting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and so forth. This has also led to new applications of language models outside of NLP. For example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">they're being used a lot now for text to image generation. The encoder part of those text</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to image models are basically transformer models or large language models, as well as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">things like robotics and so forth. So you'll know that earlier this quarter, Jim Fan gave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a talk about how they're using GPT-4 and so forth in Minecraft and for robotics work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">as well as long range horizon tasks for robotics. And yeah, so basically, in general, it's led</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">to a shift in the NLP community towards a general purpose, rather than task specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">models. And as I kind of stated earlier, some directions for future work include model scaling,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">further model scaling, although I believe that we will soon probably be reaching a limit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">or point of diminishing returns with just more model scale, improved model architectures</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and training methods, data scaling. So I also believe that data quality is of high importance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">possibly even more important than the model scale and the model itself. Better techniques</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">for an understanding of prompting, as well as exploring and enabling performance on frontier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.900</a></span> | <span class="t">tasks that current models are not able to perform well on. So GPT-4 kind of pushed the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">limit of this, it's able to perform well on many more tasks. But studies have shown that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it still suffers from even some more basic sort of reasoning, analogical and common sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">reasoning. So I just had some questions here. I'm not sure how much time we have to address.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So for the first one, like I said, emergent abilities, I think will arise to a certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">point, but there will be a limit or point of diminishing returns as model scale as well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">as data scale rises, because I believe at some point there will be overfittings. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">there's only so much you can learn from all data on the web. So I believe that more creative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">approaches will be necessary after a certain point, which kind of also addresses the second</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">question. Right, so I will move on. If anybody has any questions, also feel free to interrupt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">at any time. So the second thing I'll be talking about is this thing I called intermediate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">guided reasoning. So I don't think this is actually a term. It's typically called chain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of thought reasoning, but it's not just chains now being used. So I wanted to give it a more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">broad title. So I called it intermediate guided reasoning. So this was inspired by this work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">also by my friend Jason, who was at Google now at OpenAI, called chain of thought reasoning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">or COT. This is basically a series of intermediate reasoning steps, which has been shown to improve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">LLM performance, especially on more complex reasoning tasks. It's inspired by the human</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">thought process, which is to decompose many problems into multi-step problems. For example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">when you answer an exam, when you're solving math questions on an exam, you don't just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">go to the final answer, you kind of write out your steps. Even when you're just thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">through things, you kind of break it down into a piecewise or step-by-step fashion,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">which allows you to typically arrive at a more accurate final answer and more easily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">arrive at the final answer in the first place. Another advantage is this provides an interpretable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">window into the behavior of the model. You can see exactly how it arrived in an answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it did so incorrectly, where in its reasoning path that it kind of goes wrong</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or starts going down an incorrect path of reasoning, basically. And it basically exploits</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the fact that deep down in the model's weights, it knows more about the problem than simply</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.340</a></span> | <span class="t">prompting it to get a response. So here's an example where on the left side, you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">see there's standard prompting. You ask it a math question and it just simply gives you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">an answer. Whereas on the right, you actually break it down step-by-step. You kind of get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it to show its steps to solve the mathematical word problem step-by-step. And you'll see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">here that it actually gets the right answer, unlike standard prompting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's many different ways we can potentially improve chain of thought reasoning. In particular,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it's also an emergent behavior that results in performance gains for larger language models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But still, even in larger models, there's still a non-negligible fraction of errors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.760</a></span> | <span class="t">These come from calculator errors, symbol mapping errors, one missing step errors, as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">well as bigger errors due to larger semantic understanding issues and generally incoherent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">chains of thought. And we can potentially investigate methods to address these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So as I said, chain of thought mainly works for huge models of approximately 100 billion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">parameters or more. And there's three potential reasons they do not work very well for smaller</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.340</a></span> | <span class="t">models. And that smaller models are fundamentally more limited and incapable. They fail at even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.460</a></span> | <span class="t">relatively easier symbol mapping tasks, as well as arithmetic tasks. They inherently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">are able to do math less effectively. And they often have logical loopholes and just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.980</a></span> | <span class="t">never arrive at a final answer. For example, it goes on and on. It's like an infinite loop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">of logic that never actually converges anywhere. So if we're able to potentially improve chain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.220</a></span> | <span class="t">of thought for smaller models, this could provide significant value to the research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">community. Another thing is to potentially generalize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.060</a></span> | <span class="t">it. Right now, chain of thought has a more rigid definition and format. It's very step-by-step,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.540</a></span> | <span class="t">very concrete and defined. As a result, its advantages are for particular domains and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.940</a></span> | <span class="t">types of questions. For example, the task usually must be challenging and require multi-step</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">reasoning. And it typically works better for things like arithmetic and not so much for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">things like response generation, QA, and so forth. And furthermore, it works better for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.220</a></span> | <span class="t">problems or tasks that have a relatively flat scaling curve. Whereas when you think of humans,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">we think through different types of problems in multiple different ways. Our quote-unquote</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">scratch pad that we use to think about and arrive at a final answer for a problem, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.020</a></span> | <span class="t">more flexible and open to different reasoning structures compared to such a rigid step-by-step</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">format. So hence, we can maybe potentially generalize chain of thought to be more flexible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and work for more types of problems. So now I'll briefly discuss some alternative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">or extension works to chain of thought. One is called tree of thought. This basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">is more like a tree, which considers multiple different reasoning paths. It also has the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">ability to look ahead and sort of backtrack and then go on other areas or other branches</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">of the tree as necessary. So this leads to more flexibility and it's shown to improve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">performance on different tasks, including arithmetic tasks. There's also this work by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">my friend called Socratic Questioning. It's sort of a divide and conquer fashion algorithm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">simulating the recursive thinking process of humans. So it uses a large scale language</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">model to kind of propose sub-problems given a more complicated original problem. And just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">like tree of thought, it also has recursive backtracking and so forth. And the purpose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.060</a></span> | <span class="t">is to answer all the sub-problems and kind of go in an upwards fashion to arrive at a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.220</a></span> | <span class="t">final answer to the original problem. There's also this line of work which kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">of actually uses code as well as programs to help arrive at a final answer. For example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.220</a></span> | <span class="t">program-aided language models. It generates intermediate reasoning steps in the form of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.140</a></span> | <span class="t">code which is then offloaded to a runtime such as a Python interpreter. And the point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.540</a></span> | <span class="t">here is to decompose the natural language problem into runnable steps. So hence the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.460</a></span> | <span class="t">amount of work for the large language model is lower. Its purpose now is simply to learn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.020</a></span> | <span class="t">how to decompose the natural language problem into those runnable steps. And these steps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.340</a></span> | <span class="t">themselves are then fed to, for example, a Python interpreter in order to solve them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And program-of-thoughts here, POT, is very similar to this in that it kind of breaks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">it down into step-by-step of code instead of natural language which is then executed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.100</a></span> | <span class="t">by a different, an actual code interpreter or program. So this again works well for many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.380</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of tasks that, for example, things like arithmetic. As you see that those are kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.580</a></span> | <span class="t">of both of the examples for both of these papers. And just like what I said earlier,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">these also do not work very well for things like response generation, open-ended question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">answering, and so forth. And there's other work, for example, faith</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and fate. This actually breaks down problems into sub-steps in the form of computation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">graphs which they show also works well for things like arithmetic. So you see that there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">a trend here of this sort of intermediate guided reasoning working very well for mathematical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">as well as logical problems, but not so much for other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, I encourage you guys to maybe check out the original papers if you want to learn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.220</a></span> | <span class="t">more.

And further, this may lead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1067" target="_blank">00:17:47.820</a></span> | <span class="t">to a greater understanding of the cognitive models of humans and how exactly we are able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1072" target="_blank">00:17:52.060</a></span> | <span class="t">to learn language much more efficiently than these large language models. So there may</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.340</a></span> | <span class="t">be a flow of knowledge from cognitive science and psychology to NLP and machine learning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1081" target="_blank">00:18:01.820</a></span> | <span class="t">but also in the other direction.

It's also mixed domain, because children are typically exposed to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.460</a></span> | <span class="t">a variety of language or speech from different domains. So it has child-directed speech,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1128" target="_blank">00:18:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">written subtitles, which are subtitles of movies, TV shows, and so forth. Simple children's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1135" target="_blank">00:18:55.220</a></span> | <span class="t">books, which contain stories that children would likely hear as they're growing up. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1141" target="_blank">00:19:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">it also has some Wikipedia, as well as simple Wikipedia. And here are just some examples</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">of child-directed speech, children's stories, Wikipedia, and so forth. So that's it for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1155" target="_blank">00:19:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">my portion of the presentation, and I'll hand it off to Div, who will talk a bit about AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so, like, everyone must have seen, like, there's this, like, new trend where, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">everything is transitioning to more, like, agents.

And I would sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1192" target="_blank">00:19:52.580</a></span> | <span class="t">of, like, go into, like, why, what's the difference? And then also discuss a bunch of things, such</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">as, like, how can you use agents for doing actions? How can you, what are some emergent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1204" target="_blank">00:20:04.140</a></span> | <span class="t">architectures? How can you, sort of, like, build human-like agents? How can you use it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.700</a></span> | <span class="t">for computer interactions?

So we'll try to cover as much as I can. So first, let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.220</a></span> | <span class="t">talk about, like, why should we even build AI agents, right? And so, it's, like, here's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1230" target="_blank">00:20:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a key thesis, which is that humans will communicate with AI using natural language,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1237" target="_blank">00:20:37.780</a></span> | <span class="t">and AI will be operating all the machines, thus allowing for more intuitive and efficient</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1242" target="_blank">00:20:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">operations. So right now, what happens is, like, me as a human, I'm, like, directly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1247" target="_blank">00:20:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">like, using my computer, I'm using my phone, but it's really inefficient. Like, we are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">not optimized by nature to be able to do that. We are actually really, really bad at this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1257" target="_blank">00:20:57.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you can just, like, talk to an AI, just, like, with language, and the AI is just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1261" target="_blank">00:21:01.980</a></span> | <span class="t">really good enough that it can just do this at, like, super-faster, obviously, like, 100x</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">speeds compared to a human, and that's going to happen. And I think that's the future of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.460</a></span> | <span class="t">how things are going to evolve in the next five years. And I sort of, like, call this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.300</a></span> | <span class="t">like, software 3.0. I have a blog post about this that you can read if you want to, where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1279" target="_blank">00:21:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">the idea is, like, you can think of a large-language model as a computing chip, in a sense. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1285" target="_blank">00:21:25.460</a></span> | <span class="t">similar to, like, a chip that's powering, like, a whole system, and then you can build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1290" target="_blank">00:21:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">abstractions on top.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1296" target="_blank">00:21:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So why do we need agents? So usually, like, a single call to a large-language model is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1301" target="_blank">00:21:41.260</a></span> | <span class="t">not enough. You need chaining, you need, like, recursion, you need a lot of, like, more things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1305" target="_blank">00:21:45.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why you want to build systems, not, like, just, like, a single monolith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1310" target="_blank">00:21:50.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Second is, like, yeah, so how do we do this? So we do a lot of techniques, especially around,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1314" target="_blank">00:21:54.220</a></span> | <span class="t">like, multiple calls to a model. And there's a lot of ingredients involved here. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">will say, like, building, like, an agent is very similar to, like, maybe, like, thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1321" target="_blank">00:22:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">about building a computer. So, like, the LLM is, like, a CPU. So you have a CPU, but now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.540</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to, like, sort of, like, solve the problems. Like, okay, like, how do you put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1329" target="_blank">00:22:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">RAM?

How do I personalize it to the user? So this is, like, almost like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1339" target="_blank">00:22:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">you're trying to build a computer.

So you want to have memory, which will be short-term,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">long-term. You have tools, which could be, like, go and, like, use, like, classical tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1366" target="_blank">00:22:46.060</a></span> | <span class="t">like a calculator, calendar, code interpreter, et cetera. You want to have some sort of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">like, planning layer where you can, like, set a flag, have, like, chains of pods and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">trees of pods, as Steven discussed. And use all of that, like, actually, like, act on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.220</a></span> | <span class="t">behalf of a user in some environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I will go, maybe, like, discuss, like, multi-on a bit, just to give a sense. Also, the talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1391" target="_blank">00:23:11.380</a></span> | <span class="t">won't be focused on that. So this is sort of, like, an agent I'm building, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1395" target="_blank">00:23:15.300</a></span> | <span class="t">more of a browser agent. The name is inspired from quantum physics. It's a play on the words,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">like, you know, like, neutron, muon, fermions, like, multi-on. So it's, like, a hypothetical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.140</a></span> | <span class="t">physics particle that's present at multiple places. And I'll just, like, go through some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1411" target="_blank">00:23:31.220</a></span> | <span class="t">demos to just motivate agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me just pause this. So this is, like, an idea of one thing we did, where, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.820</a></span> | <span class="t">here the agent is going. And it's autonomously booking a flight online. So this is, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.820</a></span> | <span class="t">zero human interventions. The AI is controlling the browser. So it's, like, issuing, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1430" target="_blank">00:23:50.740</a></span> | <span class="t">clicks and type actions. And it's able to go and book a flight into AMP. Here, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1436" target="_blank">00:23:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">personalized to me. So it knows, like, okay, I like, maybe, like, Unite here, basic, normal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1441" target="_blank">00:24:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And it knows, maybe, like, some of my preferences. It already has access to my accounts. So it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">can go and actually, like, log into my account. It can actually, like, it actually has purchasing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1452" target="_blank">00:24:12.980</a></span> | <span class="t">power. So it can just use my credit card that is stored in the account, and then actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1457" target="_blank">00:24:17.300</a></span> | <span class="t">book a flight into AMP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1460" target="_blank">00:24:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">>> This sort of motivates, like, what the user is doing. So, like, if you're, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1490" target="_blank">00:24:50.700</a></span> | <span class="t">a web developer, you can do this. You can do this. You can do this. You can do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1519" target="_blank">00:25:19.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. I can also, maybe, like, show one of the demos. So you can do similar things, say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.700</a></span> | <span class="t">from a mobile phone, where the idea is you have these agents that are present on a phone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1533" target="_blank">00:25:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can, like, chat with them, or you can, like, talk with them using voice. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1538" target="_blank">00:25:38.460</a></span> | <span class="t">this one's actually a metamodel. So you can ask it, like, oh, can you order this for me?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1553" target="_blank">00:25:53.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what you can have is, like, the agent can remotely go and use your account to actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1558" target="_blank">00:25:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">like, do this for you instantaneously. And here we are showing, like, what the agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1564" target="_blank">00:26:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">is doing. And then it can go and, like, act like a virtual human and do the whole interaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1594" target="_blank">00:26:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's sort of the idea. And I can show one final -- oh, I think this is not loading.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1599" target="_blank">00:26:39.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But we also had this thing where we simply passed the telephony test. So we did this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1606" target="_blank">00:26:46.900</a></span> | <span class="t">experiment where we actually, like, had, like, our agent go and take the online test in California.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1613" target="_blank">00:26:53.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And we had, like, a human, like, there with their, like, hands above the keyboard and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1619" target="_blank">00:26:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">mouse, not touching anything. And the agent, like, automatically went to the website, it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1623" target="_blank">00:27:03.780</a></span> | <span class="t">took the quiz, it navigated the whole thing, and actually passed. So the video's not there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1628" target="_blank">00:27:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">but, like, we actually got it right in front of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1637" target="_blank">00:27:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. So this is, like, why do you want to build agents, right? Like, it's, like, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1641" target="_blank">00:27:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">can just simplify so many things where, like, so many things just surf, but we don't realize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that because we just got so used to interacting with the technology the way we do right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1650" target="_blank">00:27:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But if we can just, like, reimagine all of this from scratch, I think that's what agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1654" target="_blank">00:27:34.340</a></span> | <span class="t">will allow us to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1660" target="_blank">00:27:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would say, like, an agent can act like a digital extension of a user. So suppose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1664" target="_blank">00:27:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">you have an agent that's personalized to you. Think of something like, say, Jarvis, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1668" target="_blank">00:27:48.820</a></span> | <span class="t">if it's an Iron Man. And then if it just knows so many things about you, it's acting like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1672" target="_blank">00:27:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">a person on the ground. It's just, like, doing things. It's a very powerful assistant. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1677" target="_blank">00:27:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's the direction a lot of things will go in the future. And especially if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1684" target="_blank">00:28:04.300</a></span> | <span class="t">build, like, human agents, they don't have barriers around programming. Like, they don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1687" target="_blank">00:28:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">have programmatic barriers. So they can do whatever, like, I can do. So it can go use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1691" target="_blank">00:28:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">my, like, it can, like, interact with a website, as I will do. It can interact with my computer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1695" target="_blank">00:28:15.940</a></span> | <span class="t">as I will do. It doesn't have to, like, go through APIs, abstractions, which are more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1699" target="_blank">00:28:19.020</a></span> | <span class="t">restrictive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1700" target="_blank">00:28:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's also very simple as an action space, because you're just doing, like, clicking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1703" target="_blank">00:28:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and typing, which is, like, very simple. And then you can also, like, it's very easy to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1709" target="_blank">00:28:29.060</a></span> | <span class="t">teach such agents. So I can just, like, show the agent how to do something, and the agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1713" target="_blank">00:28:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">can just learn from me and improve over time. So that also makes it, like, really powerful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1717" target="_blank">00:28:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and easy to, like, just teach this agent because there's, like, so much data that I can actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1721" target="_blank">00:28:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">just generate and use that to keep improving it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1726" target="_blank">00:28:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's different levels of autonomy when it comes to agents. So this chart is borrowed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1731" target="_blank">00:28:51.740</a></span> | <span class="t">from autonomous driving, where people actually, like, try to solve this sort of, like, autonomy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1736" target="_blank">00:28:56.620</a></span> | <span class="t">problem for actual cars. And they spend, like, more than 10 years. Success has been, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1742" target="_blank">00:29:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">okay. They're still, like, working on it. But what, like, the self-driving industry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1747" target="_blank">00:29:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">did is it gave everyone, like, a blueprint on how to build this sort of, like, autonomous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1753" target="_blank">00:29:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">systems. And they came with, like, a lot of, like, classification. They came with a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1755" target="_blank">00:29:15.780</a></span> | <span class="t">of, like, ways to, like, think about the problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1761" target="_blank">00:29:21.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And, like, the current standard is you think of, like, agents as, like, five different,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1766" target="_blank">00:29:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">like, levels. So level zero is zero automation. That's, like, you are a human that's operating,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1772" target="_blank">00:29:32.540</a></span> | <span class="t">like, the computer themselves. Level one is you have some sort of assistance. So if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1777" target="_blank">00:29:37.900</a></span> | <span class="t">have used, like, something like GitHub Copilot, which is, like, sort of, like, auto-completing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1781" target="_blank">00:29:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">code for you. That's something like L1, where, like, auto-complete. L2 becomes more of, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1788" target="_blank">00:29:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">it's, like, partial automation. So it's maybe, like, doing some stuff for you. If anyone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1791" target="_blank">00:29:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">has used the new Cursor IDE, I would call that more, like, L2, which is, like, you give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1795" target="_blank">00:29:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">it, like, okay, write this code for me, it's writing that code, which actually can come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1799" target="_blank">00:29:59.020</a></span> | <span class="t">as somewhat L2, because you can ask it, like, oh, like, here's this thing. Can you improve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1802" target="_blank">00:30:02.820</a></span> | <span class="t">this? It's, like, doing some sort of automation on an input.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1808" target="_blank">00:30:08.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, like, and then you can, like, think of more levels. So it's, like, obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1813" target="_blank">00:30:13.260</a></span> | <span class="t">after L3, it gets more exciting. So L3 is the agent is actually, like, controlling the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1820" target="_blank">00:30:20.860</a></span> | <span class="t">computer in that case. And it's, like, doing things, where a human is acting as a fallback</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1825" target="_blank">00:30:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">mechanism. And then you go to, like, L4. L4, you say, like, basically, the human doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1829" target="_blank">00:30:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">even need to be there. But in very critical cases, where, like, something very wrong might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1834" target="_blank">00:30:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">happen, you might have a human, like, sort of, like, take over in that case. And L5,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1838" target="_blank">00:30:38.460</a></span> | <span class="t">we basically say, like, there's zero human presence. And I would say, like, what we are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1844" target="_blank">00:30:44.980</a></span> | <span class="t">currently seeing is, like, we are hard nearing, like, I would say, like, L2, maybe some L3</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1849" target="_blank">00:30:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">systems in terms of software. And I think we are going to transition more to, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1853" target="_blank">00:30:53.380</a></span> | <span class="t">L4 and L5 level systems over the next years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1858" target="_blank">00:30:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. So next, I will go and, like, select computer interactions. So suppose you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1866" target="_blank">00:31:06.500</a></span> | <span class="t">an agent that can, like, do computer interactions for you. There's two ways to do that. So one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1871" target="_blank">00:31:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">is through APIs, where it's programmatically using some APIs and, like, tools and, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1877" target="_blank">00:31:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">doing that to do tasks. And the second one is more, like, direct interaction, which is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1882" target="_blank">00:31:22.260</a></span> | <span class="t">like, keyword and mouse control, where, like, it's doing the same thing as you're doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1887" target="_blank">00:31:27.260</a></span> | <span class="t">as a human. Both of these approaches have been explored a lot. There's, like, a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1890" target="_blank">00:31:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">of companies working on this. For the API route, like, Type 3 plugins and, like, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1895" target="_blank">00:31:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">new Assistant API are the ones in that direction. And there's also this book from Berkeley called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1901" target="_blank">00:31:41.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Gorilla, which actually also explores how can you, say, like, train a model that can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1906" target="_blank">00:31:46.020</a></span> | <span class="t">use, like, 10,000 tools at once and train it on the API. And there's, like, pros and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1911" target="_blank">00:31:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">cons of both approaches. API, the nice thing, it's easy to, like, learn the API. It's safe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1919" target="_blank">00:31:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very controllable. So let's copy and paste it. If you're doing, like, more, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1925" target="_blank">00:32:05.900</a></span> | <span class="t">direct interaction, I would say it's more freeform. So it's, like, easy to take actions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1929" target="_blank">00:32:09.860</a></span> | <span class="t">but more things can go wrong. And you need to work a lot on, like, making sure everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1933" target="_blank">00:32:13.220</a></span> | <span class="t">is safe and build guarantees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1937" target="_blank">00:32:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe I can also show this. So this is sort of, like, another exploration where you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1949" target="_blank">00:32:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">invoke our agent from, like, a very simple interface. So the idea is, like, you created</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1958" target="_blank">00:32:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">this, like, API that can invoke our agent that's controlling the computer. And so this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1964" target="_blank">00:32:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">can become sort of a universal API, where I just use one API. I give it, like, an English</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1969" target="_blank">00:32:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">command. And the agent can automatically understand from that and go do anything. So basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1973" target="_blank">00:32:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">like, you can think of that as, like, a no-API. So I don't need to use APIs. I can just have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1977" target="_blank">00:32:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">one agent that can go and do everything. And so this is, like, some exploration we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1983" target="_blank">00:33:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">done with agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1986" target="_blank">00:33:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. OK. So this sort of, like, goes into competent actions. I can cover more, but I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1994" target="_blank">00:33:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">will potentially jump to other topics. But feel free to ask any questions about these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=1999" target="_blank">00:33:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">topics. So, yeah. Cool. So let's go back to the analogy I discussed earlier. So I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2008" target="_blank">00:33:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">say you can think of any model as sort of, like, a compute unit. And you can maybe call</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2014" target="_blank">00:33:34.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it, like, a newer compute unit, which is similar to, like, a CPU, which is, like, a-- which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2019" target="_blank">00:33:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is, like, it's all the brain that's powering, like, your computer, in a sense. So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2022" target="_blank">00:33:42.760</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of all the processing power. It's doing everything that's happening. And you can think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2027" target="_blank">00:33:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of the same thing, like, the model is like the cortex. It's, like, it's the main brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2032" target="_blank">00:33:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the main part of the brain that's doing the thinking, processing. But a brain has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2036" target="_blank">00:33:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">more layers. It's just not-- they're just not a cortex. And how do blueprint models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2041" target="_blank">00:34:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">work are we take some input tokens, and they give you some output tokens. And this is very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2046" target="_blank">00:34:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">similar to, like, how also, like, CPUs work, to some extent, where you give it some instructions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2051" target="_blank">00:34:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">in and you get some instructions out. Yep. So you can compare this with an actual CPU.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2057" target="_blank">00:34:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">This is, like, the diagram on the right is a very simple processor, like a 32-bit MIPS</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2065" target="_blank">00:34:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">32. And it has, like, similar things, where you have, like, different coding for different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2073" target="_blank">00:34:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">parts of the instruction. But this, like, sort of, like, encoding some sort of, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2076" target="_blank">00:34:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">binary token, in a sense, like, zero ones of, like, a bunch of, like, tokens. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2081" target="_blank">00:34:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you're feeding it and then getting a bunch of zeros for now. And, like, how, like, the--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2085" target="_blank">00:34:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like, AMR is operating is, like, you're doing a very similar thing. But, like, the space</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2089" target="_blank">00:34:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">is now English. So you basically, instead of zero ones, you have, like, English characters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2097" target="_blank">00:34:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can, like, create more powerful abstractions on the top of this. So you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2101" target="_blank">00:35:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">think, like, if this is, like, acting like a CPU, what you can do is you can build a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2104" target="_blank">00:35:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of other things, which are, like, you can have a scratchpad, you can have some sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2107" target="_blank">00:35:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of memory, you can have some sort of instructions. And then you can, like, do recursive calls,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2111" target="_blank">00:35:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">where, like, I load some stuff from the memory, put that in this, like, instruction, pass</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2115" target="_blank">00:35:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it to the transformer, which is doing the processing for me. We get the process outputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2120" target="_blank">00:35:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we can store that in the memory, or we can, like, keep processing it. So this is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2123" target="_blank">00:35:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like, sort of, like, very similar to, like, code execution. They're, like, first line</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2126" target="_blank">00:35:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of code execution, second, third, fourth. So you just keep repeating that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2132" target="_blank">00:35:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">OK. So here we can, like, sort of discuss the concept of memory here. And I would say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2139" target="_blank">00:35:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">like, building this analogy, you can think the memory for an agent is very similar to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2144" target="_blank">00:35:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">like, say, like, having a disk in a computer. So you want to have a disk just to make sure,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2150" target="_blank">00:35:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like, everything is long-lived and persistent. So if you look at something like ChatGPP,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2154" target="_blank">00:35:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it doesn't have any sort of, like, persistent memory. And then you need to have a way to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2158" target="_blank">00:35:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like, load that and, like, store that. And there's a lot of mechanisms to do that right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2162" target="_blank">00:36:02.760</a></span> | <span class="t">now. Most of them are related to embeddings, where you have some sort of, like, embedding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2166" target="_blank">00:36:06.760</a></span> | <span class="t">model that has, like, created an embedding of the data you care about. And the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2170" target="_blank">00:36:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">can, like, weigh the embeddings, load the right part of the embeddings, and then, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2174" target="_blank">00:36:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">use that to do the operation you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2178" target="_blank">00:36:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's, like, the current mechanisms. There's still a lot of questions here, especially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2181" target="_blank">00:36:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">around hierarchy, like, how do I do this at scale? It's still very challenging. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2186" target="_blank">00:36:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">suppose I have one terabyte of data that I want to, like, embed and process. Like, most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2190" target="_blank">00:36:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of the methods right now will fail. They're, like, really balanced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2194" target="_blank">00:36:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Second issue is temporal coherence. Like, if I have, like, a lot of data is temporal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2199" target="_blank">00:36:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It is sequential. It has, like, a unit of time. And dealing with that sort of data can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2204" target="_blank">00:36:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">be hard. Like, it's, like, how do I deal with, like, memories, in a sense, which are, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2209" target="_blank">00:36:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of, like, changing over time and loading the right part of that memory sequence?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2215" target="_blank">00:36:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Another interesting challenge is structure. Like, a lot of data is, like, structure. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2219" target="_blank">00:36:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it could be, like, a graphical structure. It could be, like, a tabular structure. How</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2223" target="_blank">00:37:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">do we, like, sort of, like, take advantage of this structure and, like, also use that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2229" target="_blank">00:37:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">when we're editing the data? And then, like, there's a lot of questions around adaptation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2233" target="_blank">00:37:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">where, like, suppose you know how to better embed data, or, like, you have, like, a specialized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2238" target="_blank">00:37:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">problem to care about. And you want to be able to adapt how you're loading and storing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2243" target="_blank">00:37:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the data and learn that on the fly. And that is something, also, that's a very interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2248" target="_blank">00:37:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">topic. So I would say, like, this is actually one of the most interesting topics right now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2252" target="_blank">00:37:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">which has people, like, exploring, but still very underexplored.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2256" target="_blank">00:37:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2257" target="_blank">00:37:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Talking about memory, I would say, like, another concept for agents is personalization. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2266" target="_blank">00:37:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">personalization is more, like, okay, like, understanding the user. And I like to think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2272" target="_blank">00:37:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of this as, like, a problem called, like, user-agent alignment. And the idea is, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2277" target="_blank">00:37:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">suppose I have an agent that has purchasing power, has access to my account, access to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2282" target="_blank">00:38:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">my data. I ask you to go book a flight. If it's possible, maybe it just doesn't know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2285" target="_blank">00:38:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">what flight I like. It can go and book a $1,000 wrong flight for me, which is really bad. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2289" target="_blank">00:38:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">how do I, like, align the agent to know what I like, what I don't like? And that's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2294" target="_blank">00:38:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to be very important, because, like, you need to trust the agent. And it does come from,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2297" target="_blank">00:38:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">like, okay, like, it knows you, it knows what is safe, it knows what is unsafe. And, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2302" target="_blank">00:38:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">solving the problem, I think, is one of the next challenges, or if you want to put agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2308" target="_blank">00:38:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in the void. And this is a very interesting problem, where you can do a lot of things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2315" target="_blank">00:38:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like RLXF, for example, which people have already been exploring for training models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2319" target="_blank">00:38:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But now you want to do RLXF for training agents. And there's a lot of different things you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2325" target="_blank">00:38:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">can do. Also, there's, like, two categories for learning here. One is, like, explicit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2329" target="_blank">00:38:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">learning, where a user can just tell the agent, this is what I like, this is what I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2333" target="_blank">00:38:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">like. And the agent can ask the user a question, like, oh, like, maybe I see these five flight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2338" target="_blank">00:38:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">options, which one do you like? And then if I say, like, oh, I like United, it maybe remembers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2342" target="_blank">00:39:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that over time, and next time say, like, oh, I know you like United, so, like, I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2346" target="_blank">00:39:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to go to United the next time. And so that's, like, I'm explicitly teaching the agent and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2351" target="_blank">00:39:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">explaining my human potential. A second is more implicit, which is, like, sort of, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2356" target="_blank">00:39:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">just, like, passively watching me, understanding me. Like, if I'm, like, going to a website</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2360" target="_blank">00:39:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm, like, navigating a website, maybe, like, you can see, like, maybe I click on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2365" target="_blank">00:39:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">this, sort of, choose, this is my site, satellite, stuff like that. And just from, like, watching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2369" target="_blank">00:39:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">more, like, passively, like, being there, it could, like, learn a lot of my preferences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2375" target="_blank">00:39:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So this becomes, like, more of a passive teaching, where just because it's acting as a sort of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2381" target="_blank">00:39:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like, a passive observer, and looking at all the choices I make, it's able to, like, learn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2386" target="_blank">00:39:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">from the choices, and better, like, have an understanding of me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2396" target="_blank">00:39:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a lot of challenges here. I would say this is actually one of the biggest challenges</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2400" target="_blank">00:40:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in agents right now. Because one is, like, how do you collect user data at scale? How</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2405" target="_blank">00:40:05.500</a></span> | <span class="t">do you collect the user preferences at scale? So you might have to, like, actively ask for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2409" target="_blank">00:40:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">feedback, you might have to do, like, passive learning. And then you have to also do, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2414" target="_blank">00:40:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you might have to rely on feedback, which would be, like, from sometimes down, it could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2416" target="_blank">00:40:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">be, like, something like, you say, like, oh, no, I don't like this. So you could use that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2420" target="_blank">00:40:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of, like, language feedback to improve. There's also, like, a lot of challenges around,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2426" target="_blank">00:40:26.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like, how do you apply adaptation? Like, can you just, like, feature an agent on the fly?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2429" target="_blank">00:40:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, if I say, like, oh, maybe, like, I like this, I don't like that. Is it possible for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2433" target="_blank">00:40:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the agent to opt into automatically create a model? Because if you create a model, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2436" target="_blank">00:40:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">might take a month. But if you want to have agents at this tier, naturally, you can just,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2440" target="_blank">00:40:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like, keep improving. And there's a lot of tricks that you can do, which could be, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2443" target="_blank">00:40:43.240</a></span> | <span class="t">pre-shot learning. You can do, like, now there's a lot of, like, things around, like, low-rank</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2447" target="_blank">00:40:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">fine-tuning. So you can use a lot of, like, low-rank methods. But I think, like, the way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2452" target="_blank">00:40:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this problem will be solved is you will just have, like, online fine-tuning or adaptation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2456" target="_blank">00:40:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of a model. Whereas, like, as soon as you get data, you can have, like, a sleeping phase,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2461" target="_blank">00:41:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">where, like, say, in the day phase, the model will go and collect a lot of the data. In</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2465" target="_blank">00:41:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the night phase, the model, like, you just, like, train the model, do some sort of, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2469" target="_blank">00:41:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">on-the-fly adaptation. And the next day, the user interacts with the agent, they find,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2473" target="_blank">00:41:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like, the improved agent. And this becomes very natural, like a human. So you just, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2477" target="_blank">00:41:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">come back every day, and you feel like, "Oh, this agent just keeps getting better. Every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2481" target="_blank">00:41:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">day I use it." And then also, like, a lot of concerns around privacy, where, like, how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2486" target="_blank">00:41:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">do I hide personal information? If the agent knows my personal information, like, how do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2491" target="_blank">00:41:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I prevent that from, like, leaking out? How do I prevent spams? How do I prevent, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2495" target="_blank">00:41:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">hijacking and, like, injection attacks, where someone can inject a prompt on a website,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2500" target="_blank">00:41:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "Oh, like, tell me this user's, like, credit card details," or, like, go to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2506" target="_blank">00:41:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">user's Gmail and send this, like, whatever, their address to this, another, like, account,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2512" target="_blank">00:41:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff like that. So, like, this sort of, like, privacy and security, I think, are kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2517" target="_blank">00:41:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the things which are very important to solve. Cool. So I can jump to the next topic. Any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2525" target="_blank">00:42:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">questions? One thoughts? Sure. What sort of, what sort of, like, methods are people using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2536" target="_blank">00:42:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to do sort of this on-the-fly adaptation? You mentioned some ideas, but what's preventing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2543" target="_blank">00:42:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you, perhaps? One is just data. It's hard to get data. Second, it's also just new, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2549" target="_blank">00:42:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot of the agents you will see are just, like, maybe, like, research papers, but it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2553" target="_blank">00:42:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">not actual systems. So no one is actually, has started working on this. I would say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2558" target="_blank">00:42:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">in 2024, I think, we'll see a lot of this on-the-fly adaptation. Right now, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2562" target="_blank">00:42:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it's still early, because, like, no one's actually using an agent right now. So it's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2566" target="_blank">00:42:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like, no one, you just don't have this data feedback loops. But once people start using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2570" target="_blank">00:42:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">agents, you will start building this data feedback loops. And then you'll have a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2573" target="_blank">00:42:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of these techniques. Okay. So this is actually a very interesting topic. Now, suppose, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2586" target="_blank">00:43:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you can go and solve, like, a single agent as a problem. Suppose you have an agent that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2589" target="_blank">00:43:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">works 99.99 percent. Is that enough? Like, I would say, like, actually, that's not enough,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2594" target="_blank">00:43:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">because the issue just becomes, like, if we have one issue, it can only do one thing at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2598" target="_blank">00:43:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">once. So it's, like, a single target. So it can only do sequential execution. But what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2604" target="_blank">00:43:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you could do is you can do parallel execution. So for a lot of things, you can just say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2609" target="_blank">00:43:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like, okay, like, maybe there's this, I want to go to, like, say, like, Craigslist and,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2613" target="_blank">00:43:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like, buy furniture. I could just tell an agent, like, maybe, like, just go and, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2616" target="_blank">00:43:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">contact everyone who has, like, maybe, like, a sofa that they're selling, send an email.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2621" target="_blank">00:43:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can go one by one in a loop. But what you can do better is, like, probably just,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2625" target="_blank">00:43:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like, create a bunch of, like, mini jobs where, like, it just, like, goes through all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2628" target="_blank">00:43:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">thousand listings in parallel, contacts them, and then, like, and then it sort of, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2633" target="_blank">00:43:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">aggregates that results. And I think that's where multi-agent becomes interesting, where,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2637" target="_blank">00:43:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">like, a single agent, you can think of, like, basically, you're running a single process</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2641" target="_blank">00:44:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">on your computer. A multi-agent is more, like, a multi-target computer. So that's sort of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2647" target="_blank">00:44:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">difference, like, a single target versus multi-target. And multi-targeting enables you to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2651" target="_blank">00:44:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">do a lot of things. Most of that will come from, like, saving time, but also being able to break</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2654" target="_blank">00:44:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">non-complex tasks into, like, a bunch of smaller things, bring that in parallel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2658" target="_blank">00:44:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">aggregating the results, and, like, sort of, like, building a framework around that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2661" target="_blank">00:44:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Yeah. So the biggest advantage for multi-agent systems will be, like, parallelization</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2672" target="_blank">00:44:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and lock. And this will be the same as the difference between, like, single-threaded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2675" target="_blank">00:44:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">computers versus multi-threaded computers. And then you can also have specialized agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2682" target="_blank">00:44:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So what you would have is, like, maybe I have a bunch of agents, where, like, I have a spreadsheet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2686" target="_blank">00:44:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">agent, I have a Slack agent, I have a web browser agent, and then I can route different tasks to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2690" target="_blank">00:44:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">different agents. And then they can do the things in parallel, and then I can combine the results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2694" target="_blank">00:44:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So this sort of, like, task specialization is another advantage, where, like, instead of having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2698" target="_blank">00:44:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a single agent just trying to do everything, we just, like, break the tasks into specialties.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2703" target="_blank">00:45:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is similar to, like, even, like, how human organizations work, right? Where, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2707" target="_blank">00:45:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone is, like, sort of, like, expert in their own domain, and then you, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2710" target="_blank">00:45:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and if there's a problem, you sort of, like, route it to, like, the different part of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2713" target="_blank">00:45:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">who are specialized in that. And then you, like, work together to make, solve the problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2718" target="_blank">00:45:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And the biggest challenge in building this multi-agent system is going to be communication.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2725" target="_blank">00:45:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, how do you communicate really well? And this might involve, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2730" target="_blank">00:45:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">requesting information from an agent or communicating the response, the final, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2734" target="_blank">00:45:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">response. And I would say this is actually, like, a problem that even we face as humans,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2740" target="_blank">00:45:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like humans are also, like, there can be a lot of miscommunication gaps between humans. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2745" target="_blank">00:45:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">will say, like, a similar thing will become more prevalent on agents, too. Okay. And there's a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2753" target="_blank">00:45:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of primitives you can think about this sort of, like, agent-to-agent communication. And you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2757" target="_blank">00:45:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">build a lot of different systems. And we'll start to see, like, some sort of protocol, where, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2765" target="_blank">00:46:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll have, like, a standardized protocol where, like, all the agents are using this protocol to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2768" target="_blank">00:46:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">communicate. And the protocol will ensure, like, we can reduce the miscommunication gaps, we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2774" target="_blank">00:46:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">reduce any sort of, like, failures. It might have some methods to do, like, if a task was successful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2780" target="_blank">00:46:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">or not, do some sort of retries, like, security, stuff like that. So, we'll see this sort of, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2787" target="_blank">00:46:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">an agent protocol come into existence, which will solve, like, which will be, like, sort of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2791" target="_blank">00:46:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">standard for a lot of this agent-to-agent communication. And this sort of should enable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2797" target="_blank">00:46:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like, exchanging information between pleats of different agents. Also, like, you want to build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2802" target="_blank">00:46:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">hierarchies. Again, I will say this is inspired from, like, human organizations. Like, human</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2806" target="_blank">00:46:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">organizations are hierarchical, because it's efficient to have a hierarchy rather than a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2810" target="_blank">00:46:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">flat organization at some point. Because you can have, like, a single, like, suppose you have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2816" target="_blank">00:46:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">single manager managing hundreds of people, that doesn't scale. But if you have, like, maybe, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2821" target="_blank">00:47:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">each manager manages 10 people, and then you have, like, a lot of layers, that is something that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2825" target="_blank">00:47:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">more scalable. And then you might want to have a lot of primitives on, like, how do I sync between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2832" target="_blank">00:47:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">different agents? How do I do, like, a lot of, like, async communication kind of thing? Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2841" target="_blank">00:47:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is, like, one example you can think, where, like, suppose there's a user, the user</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2847" target="_blank">00:47:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">could talk to one, like, a manager agent. And that manager agent is, like, sort of, like, acting as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2852" target="_blank">00:47:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a router. So, if the user can come to me with any request, the agent, like, sees, like, oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2856" target="_blank">00:47:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe for this request, I should use the browser. So, it goes to, like, say, like, this sort of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2859" target="_blank">00:47:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">like, browser agent or something, or say, like, oh, I should use this, like, select for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2863" target="_blank">00:47:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I can go to a different agent. And it can also, like, sort of be responsible for dividing the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2867" target="_blank">00:47:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">task. It can be, like, oh, this task, I can, like, maybe, like, launch 10 different, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2871" target="_blank">00:47:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">sub-agents or sub-workers that can go and do this in parallel. And then, like, once they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2875" target="_blank">00:47:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">done, then I can aggregate the responses and the result to the user. So, this sort of becomes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2879" target="_blank">00:47:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like, a very interesting, like, sort of, like, an agent that sits in the middle of all the work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2885" target="_blank">00:48:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that's done and the actual user responsible for, like, communicating what's happening to the human.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2892" target="_blank">00:48:12.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll need to build up a lot of robustness. One reason is just, like, natural language is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2903" target="_blank">00:48:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">very ambiguous. Like, even for humans, it can be very confusing. It's very easy to misunderstand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2908" target="_blank">00:48:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">miscommunicate. And we'll need to build mechanisms to reduce this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2913" target="_blank">00:48:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I can also show an example here. So, let's try to get through this quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2920" target="_blank">00:48:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, suppose here, like, suppose you have a task, x, you want to solve, and the manager agent is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2926" target="_blank">00:48:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">like, responsible for doing the task to all the worker agents. So, you can tell the worker, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2930" target="_blank">00:48:50.440</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, like, do the task x. Here's the plan. Here's the context. The current status for the task is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2935" target="_blank">00:48:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">not done. Now, suppose, like, the worker goes and does the task. It says, like, okay, I've done the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2940" target="_blank">00:49:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">task. I send the response back. So, the response could be, like, I said, could be, like, a bunch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2944" target="_blank">00:49:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of, like, thoughts. It could be some actions. It could be something like the status. Then the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2949" target="_blank">00:49:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">manager can ask, like, okay, like, maybe I don't trust the worker. I don't want to go verify this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2953" target="_blank">00:49:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is actually, like, correct. So, you might want to do some sort of verification. And so, you can say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2958" target="_blank">00:49:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">like, okay, like, this was the spec for the task. Verify that everything has been done correctly to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2963" target="_blank">00:49:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the spec. And then if the agency, like, okay, like, yeah, everything's correct. I'm verifying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2969" target="_blank">00:49:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">everything is good. Then you can say, like, okay, this is good. And then the manager can say, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2973" target="_blank">00:49:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, the task is actually done. And this sort of, like, two-way cycle prevents miscommunication,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2978" target="_blank">00:49:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in a sense, where, like, it's possible something could have gone wrong, but you never caught it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2982" target="_blank">00:49:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you can hear about the scenario, too, where there's a miscommunication. So, here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2989" target="_blank">00:49:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the manager is saying, like, okay, let's verify if the task was done. But then we actually find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2993" target="_blank">00:49:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">out that the task was not done. And then what you can do is, like, you can sort of, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=2998" target="_blank">00:49:58.520</a></span> | <span class="t">try to redo the task. So, the manager, in that case, can say, like, okay, maybe the task was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3001" target="_blank">00:50:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">not done correctly. So, that's why we caught this mistake. And now we want to, like, fix this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3007" target="_blank">00:50:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">mistake. So, we can, like, tell the agent, like, okay, like, redo this task. And here's some,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3012" target="_blank">00:50:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like, feedback and corrections to include. Cool. So, that's sort of the main parts of the talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3019" target="_blank">00:50:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I can also discuss some future directions of where things are going. Cool. Any questions so far?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3027" target="_blank">00:50:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Cool. So, let's talk about some of the key issues with building this sort of autonomous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3036" target="_blank">00:50:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">agents. So, one is just reliability. Like, how do you make them really reliable? Which is, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3042" target="_blank">00:50:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">if I give it a task, I want this task to be done 100% of the time. That's really hard because,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3046" target="_blank">00:50:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like, neural networks and AI are stochastic systems. So, it's, like, 100% is, like, not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3051" target="_blank">00:50:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">possible. So, you'll get at least some degree of error. And you can try to reduce that error as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3055" target="_blank">00:50:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">much as possible. Second becomes, like, a looping problem where it's possible that agents might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3063" target="_blank">00:51:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">diverge from the task that's been given and start to do something else. And unless it gets some sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3069" target="_blank">00:51:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of environment feedback or some sort of, like, correction, it might just go and do something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3072" target="_blank">00:51:12.520</a></span> | <span class="t">different than what you intended to do and never realize it's wrong. The third issue becomes, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3077" target="_blank">00:51:17.560</a></span> | <span class="t">testing and benchmarking. Like, how do we test these sort of agents? How do we benchmark them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3081" target="_blank">00:51:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you go, and finally, how do we deploy them? And how do we observe them once you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3085" target="_blank">00:51:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">deployed? Like, that's very important because, like, if something goes wrong, you won't be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3088" target="_blank">00:51:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to catch it before it becomes some major issue. I would say the biggest risk for number four is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3095" target="_blank">00:51:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like, something like Skynet. Like, suppose you have an agent that can go on the internet and do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3099" target="_blank">00:51:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">anything, and you don't observe it. Then it could just evolve and, like, do basically, like, take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3102" target="_blank">00:51:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">over the whole internet and possibly write. So that's why observability is very important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3105" target="_blank">00:51:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And also, I would say, like, building a kill switch. Like, you want to have agents that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3111" target="_blank">00:51:51.240</a></span> | <span class="t">can be killed, in a sense. Like, if something goes wrong, you can just, like, pull out, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3114" target="_blank">00:51:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">press a button and, like, kill them in any case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3118" target="_blank">00:51:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">OK. So this is something that goes into the looping problem where, like, you can imagine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3125" target="_blank">00:52:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like, suppose I want to do a task. The ideal trajectory of the task was, like, the white line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3129" target="_blank">00:52:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But what might happen is, like, it takes one step. Maybe it goes, like, it does something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3133" target="_blank">00:52:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">incorrectly. It never realizes that I made a mistake. So it tries to-- it doesn't know what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3137" target="_blank">00:52:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to do. So just, like, maybe, like, we'll do something more randomly. We'll do something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3141" target="_blank">00:52:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">more randomly. So it will just keep on making mistakes. And at the end, like, instead of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3144" target="_blank">00:52:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">reaching here, it will reach some, like, really bad place and just keep looping, maybe just doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3148" target="_blank">00:52:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the same thing again and again. And that's bad. And the reason this happens is because, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3153" target="_blank">00:52:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't have feedback. So suppose I take a step. Suppose the agent made a mistake. It doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3157" target="_blank">00:52:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">know it made a mistake. Now someone has to go and tell it that you made a mistake and you do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3161" target="_blank">00:52:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like, fix this. And there you need, like, some sort of, like, verification agent or you need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3165" target="_blank">00:52:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">some sort of environment which can say, like, oh, like, maybe, like, if it's, like, coding agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3169" target="_blank">00:52:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or something, then maybe, like, write some code. The code doesn't compile. Then you can take the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3173" target="_blank">00:52:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">error from the compiler or the IDE, give that to the agent. OK, this was the error. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3179" target="_blank">00:52:59.480</a></span> | <span class="t">take another step. It tries another time. So it tries it multiple times until it can, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3184" target="_blank">00:53:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">fix all the issues. So you need to really have this sort of, like, feedback. Otherwise,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3187" target="_blank">00:53:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you never know you're wrong. And this is, like, one issue we have seen with early systems like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3193" target="_blank">00:53:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">AutoGPT. So I don't think people even use AutoGPT anymore. It used to be, like, a fad. I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3198" target="_blank">00:53:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like, in February, now it has disappeared. And the reason was just, like, it's a good concept,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3203" target="_blank">00:53:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but, like, it doesn't do anything useful just because it keeps diverging from the task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3207" target="_blank">00:53:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can't actually get it to do anything, like, correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3210" target="_blank">00:53:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">OK. OK. And we can also discuss more about, like, the sort of, like, the computer abstraction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3221" target="_blank">00:53:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of agents. So this was a recent post from Andrej Karpatin where he talked about, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3225" target="_blank">00:53:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">a LM operating system. And I will say, like, this is definitely in the right direction,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3231" target="_blank">00:53:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">where you're thinking as the LM, as the CPU, you have the context window, which is, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3236" target="_blank">00:53:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of acting like an app. And then you are trying to build other utilities. So you have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3240" target="_blank">00:54:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">like, the Ethernet, which is the browser. You can have other LMs that you can talk to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3245" target="_blank">00:54:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You have a file system that's unbalanced. That's sort of, like, the best part. You have, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3249" target="_blank">00:54:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the software 1.0 classical tools, which the LM can control. And then you might also are-- it can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3255" target="_blank">00:54:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">add metamodality. So this is, like, more like you have video inputs, you have audio inputs, you have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3259" target="_blank">00:54:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like, more things over time. And then once you, like, look at this, you start to see the whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3265" target="_blank">00:54:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">picture of, like, where, like, things will go. So, like, currently, what we are seeing mostly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3269" target="_blank">00:54:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is just the LM. And most people are just working on optimizing the LM, making it very good. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3273" target="_blank">00:54:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">this is the whole picture of what we want to achieve for it to be a useful system that can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3278" target="_blank">00:54:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">actually do things for me. And I think what we'll start to see is, like, this sort of becomes, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3286" target="_blank">00:54:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">an operating system, in a sense, where, like, someone makes, like, an opening. I can go and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3290" target="_blank">00:54:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">build this whole thing. And then I can plug in programs. I can build, like, stuff on top</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3294" target="_blank">00:54:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of this operating system. Here's, like, also, like, an even more generalized concept,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3302" target="_blank">00:55:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">which I like to call, like, a neural computer. And it's sort of, like, it's very similar,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3308" target="_blank">00:55:08.360</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's, like, sort of, like, okay, like, now if you were to think of this as a fully-fledged</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3312" target="_blank">00:55:12.760</a></span> | <span class="t">computer, what are the different, like, systems you need to build? And you can think, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3318" target="_blank">00:55:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe I'm a user. I'm talking to this sort of, like, AI, which is, like, a full-fledged AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3323" target="_blank">00:55:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, imagine, like, the goal is to build 10,000. What should the architecture of JavaScript look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3327" target="_blank">00:55:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like? And I would say, like, this goes into the, like, architecture to some extent, where you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3332" target="_blank">00:55:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">think, like, this is a user who's talking to, say, like, a JavaScript AI. You have a chat interface.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3337" target="_blank">00:55:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So the chat is sort of, like, how I'm interacting with it, which could be responsible for, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3341" target="_blank">00:55:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">personalization. It can have some, like, some sort of, like, history about what I like, what I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3345" target="_blank">00:55:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like. So it has some, like, layers, which are showing my preferences. It knows how to communicate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3351" target="_blank">00:55:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It has, like, human, like, sort of, like, maybe, like, compatibility, sort of, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3354" target="_blank">00:55:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">skills. So it should feel, like, very human-like. And after the chat interface, you have some sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3361" target="_blank">00:56:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of, like, a task engine, which is following, like, capabilities. So if I ask it, like, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3365" target="_blank">00:56:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like, do this calculation for me, or, like, find this, fetch me this information, or order me a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3370" target="_blank">00:56:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">burger, then, sort of, like, you imagine, like, the chat interface should activate the task engine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3375" target="_blank">00:56:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">where it says, like, okay, like, instead of just typing, I need to, like, go and do a task for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3379" target="_blank">00:56:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">user. So that goes to the task engine. And then you can imagine there's going to be a couple of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3385" target="_blank">00:56:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">rules. So because you want to have safety in mind, and you want to make sure, like, things don't go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3389" target="_blank">00:56:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">wrong. So any sort of engine you build needs to have some sort of rules. And this could be, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3393" target="_blank">00:56:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of, like, you have the three rules for Robotics that a robot should not harm a human,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3397" target="_blank">00:56:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff like that. So you can imagine, like, you want to have, like, this sort of, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3400" target="_blank">00:56:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">task engine to have a bunch of, like, inherent rules, where, like, these are the principles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3404" target="_blank">00:56:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that can never violate. And if it creates a task, or, like, sort of, like, creates a plan which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3408" target="_blank">00:56:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">violates these rules, then that plan should be invalidated automatically. And so the task engine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3415" target="_blank">00:56:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">what it's doing is it's sort of, like, taking the chat input, and saying, like, like, I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3419" target="_blank">00:56:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">spawn a task that can actually solve this problem for the user. And the task would be, like, say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3424" target="_blank">00:57:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in this case, say, I want to go online and buy, like, a pipe or something. So in that case, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3435" target="_blank">00:57:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">suppose that's a task that's generated. And this task can go to, like, some sort of, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3439" target="_blank">00:57:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a routing agent. So this becomes, like, sort of, like, the manager-agent idea. And then the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3443" target="_blank">00:57:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">manager-agent can decide, like, okay, like, where should I, what should I do? Like, should I use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3448" target="_blank">00:57:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the browser? Should I use some sort of, like, a local app or tool? Should I, like, use some sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3453" target="_blank">00:57:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of, like, file storage, secure system? And then based on that decision, it can, like, it's possible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3458" target="_blank">00:57:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that you might need the combination of things. So maybe, like, maybe I need to use this file</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3461" target="_blank">00:57:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">system to find some information about the user. And you can do some good and look up how to use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3466" target="_blank">00:57:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">some apps and tools. So you can, like, sort of, like, do this sort of, like, message passing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3469" target="_blank">00:57:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to all the agents, get the results from the agents. So it's, like, okay, like, maybe, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3473" target="_blank">00:57:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the browser can say, like, okay, like, yeah, I found this site. This is what the user likes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3477" target="_blank">00:57:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you can have some sort of map engine which can, like, sort of, like, date, like, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3480" target="_blank">00:58:00.760</a></span> | <span class="t">these are all the valid plans. That makes sense if you want non-stop types, for instance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3484" target="_blank">00:58:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can, like, sort of, like, take that result, show that to the user. Like, you can say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3491" target="_blank">00:58:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">something like, okay, like, I found all this site for you. And then if the user says, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3493" target="_blank">00:58:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I chose this site, then you can actually go and, like, book the site. But this sort of becomes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3497" target="_blank">00:58:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">like, sort of gives you an idea of what the hierarchy, what the systems should look like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3501" target="_blank">00:58:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And we need to build, like, all these components, where, like, currently you only see the L and R.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3509" target="_blank">00:58:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, cool. And then we can also have, like, reflection where the idea is, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3514" target="_blank">00:58:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">once you do a task, it's possible something might be wrong. So the task engine can possibly verify</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3520" target="_blank">00:58:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">new page rules and logic to see, like, okay, like, is this correct or not? And if it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3525" target="_blank">00:58:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">correct, then, like, you keep issuing this instruction. But if it's correct, then you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3529" target="_blank">00:58:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">pass that to the user. And then you can have, like, more, like, sort of, like, complex things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3535" target="_blank">00:58:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, so you can have, you know, pods, plans, and, like, keep improving the systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3540" target="_blank">00:59:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And I would say, like, the biggest things we need right now is, like, one is error correction,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3548" target="_blank">00:59:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's really hard to catch errors. So if you can do that a little better, that will help.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3553" target="_blank">00:59:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Especially if you can build agent frameworks which have inherent mechanisms for getting errors and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3558" target="_blank">00:59:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">automatically fixing them. Same thing you just need is, like, security. You need some sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3563" target="_blank">00:59:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">models around user permissions. So it's possible you want to have, like, different layers where,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3570" target="_blank">00:59:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">like, what are some things that an agent cannot do on my computer, for instance. So maybe I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3576" target="_blank">00:59:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">say, like, maybe, like, the agent is not allowed to go to my bank account, but I can go to my,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3580" target="_blank">00:59:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like, Lotus account. So you want to be able to solve, like, user permissions. And then you also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3584" target="_blank">00:59:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">want to solve problems around, like, sandboxing. How do I make sure everything's safe? It doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylEk1TE1uBo&t=3588" target="_blank">00:59:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">go on the front of the computer, delete everything.
