And also, thank you to our sponsors, DoorDash, Dollar Shave Club, and Cash App. Click the links in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p><p>Here we go. I don't know if I actually know what the goal of a meme review is, but I'll just give it to you. All right, so on Calm Down Calm Down, A+. Just what do you make of the absurd fact that when you divide by zero, that's not allowed, that breaks the universe?</p><p>And my review is that the devils in the upper right quadrant aren't nearly appreciative enough of projective geometry. So that's my review of them. It's been this. Oh, yeah. OK. This is a machine. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results. Yeah. Well, machine learning is doing it over and over again, but bigger.</p><p>Yeah. So sometimes, you know, quantity has a quality all of its own. Yeah, scale. Just like with GPT-3, there's some magic that happens. Yeah. Einstein didn't have 175 billion parameters. That's my review of that meme. This one, whatever numbers you think, whenever you think you know numbers, my review is it's not sufficiently mindful of diversity concerns and how the peodics are consistently underrepresented in people's conception of what the different number systems are.</p><p>So I think it's, I'm going to say narrow-minded. That's my review of that one. All right, you study college-level math. Yes, I am almost done with my bachelor's degree, so you know a lot of math. This one is uncomfortably true. This is to our point, is when you get your degree in math.</p><p>There's a lot left to know. That's not even, it's hard to, oh my god. I think there's, so what is that? I think that's a fish eating a cat. Yeah, no, so it's a cat eating a fish, and then the fish eating the cat. So I just have to say A+.</p><p>This should be in every algebra textbook. That's my meme review. I poured root beer into a squared glass. Now I just have beer. Tired. Not impressed. Not impressed. Engineering. Got Mythbusters and such. Physics. Oh, this is a prior discussion. This is a prior discussion. No one thinks that you could popularize math.</p><p>That's interesting. So it ends with, that is insightful. Poignant. So do you think there could be a cosmos for mathematics? Yeah, I actually, I think there's huge appetite for it. I think Numberphile proves this fact. And your channel, I mean that's true, but there's not, for some reason, do you think there'll be a Netflix show one day with theâ€¦ Anyone at Netflix is watching this, I will host it for you.</p><p>You just call me. But do you think you could have a general public kind of show like Cosmos and do mathematics? 100%. I think it wouldn't be easy because you've got this tight line between are you doing it substantively or are you just waving your hands? I think there's enough really interesting math that you can substantively get across.</p><p>And I do think there's a pretty big appetite for it. The reason I say Numberphile isn't just that Numberphile is great, but that Brady has like 10 projects of very similarly styled channels, and Numberphile is the biggest among them by far. But they're all successful. They're all successful, but I would have guessed if you were just pitching these products, you know, like 10 years ago, like, oh, the channel on physics will be very popular, the chemistry one will be pretty popular, the numbers one, I don't know, some people, that might be like third or something.</p><p>But the idea that the one about math is the most popular of his channels by far, even though they're similar styles, it does, I do think speaks to the fact that there is a unsatiated appetite for real, a real understanding of what gets mathematicians going. And I think a Netflix type entity might recognize that.</p><p>You heard it here, Netflix. Half-off haircuts. Oh, it's getting shaved. It's every time it's shaving half of the remaining hair. This is going to take a... That's... Great, I love it. It's kind of brilliant. That's my review. No substantive descriptions, just I love it. Oh, I actually saw this one for a print.</p><p>Yeah, "Cotechin, Seacant, and Kosyngin, you deserve to be quiet over there. Who needs you?" Oh, you don't give them the love? You think sine, cosine, tangent, these are all... So you make the calculus of like tangent look a little bit more compact, while kind of be confusing to every single calculus student there that's like, wait, what was Seacant again?</p><p>Just write it as one over cosine squared. It's not that many more symbols. Oh, you're contributing to the problem. Well, thank you for doing the most absurd thing I probably have ever done. You probably have ever done. I appreciate it. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.</p><p>Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.</p></div></div></body></html>
