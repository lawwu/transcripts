As we saw on Monday, looking at stimulants like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=9" target="_blank">00:00:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">caffeine, sugar, nicotine, amphetamines, and cannabis, and THC, for some, it's a complex</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=15" target="_blank">00:00:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">world, and it's getting more complex by the day, and it's a world that we have to navigate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=20" target="_blank">00:00:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">with wisdom. We have to. And for guidance, Psalm 19.7 is one of my favorite texts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Psalm 19.7, the psalmist tells us, "The teaching of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple."

And so Monday, we apply biblical wisdom when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it comes to stimulants. And on this pursuit of wisdom recently arrived this clip from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a listener who sent it in. It's from a 1981 sermon from Pastor John in Proverbs 4, verses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">1-13, talking about where to find wisdom. I had not listened to this message, but I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">did recently. I love it, because Pastor John opens by talking about our pursuit of joy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which is what drives all of our lives and the substances that we consume. Pastor John</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">said this, "I believe that all men have this in common, namely, that we all want to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">happy." Now, not all of us agree on how to find that happiness or where it comes from,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but we do agree that we want it. I think that's common ground for all humankind. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">not a bad thing. That's a good thing. That's the way God made us. Evil is not wanting to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">be happy. Evil is seeking and finding that happiness in the wrong places. And goodness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is seeking and finding that happiness in places that please and honor God. I can conceive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of a world in which we might be called upon to sacrifice our happiness for God's glory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But that is not the kind of world in which we live.

Evil is not wanting to be happy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Evil is seeking and finding that happiness in the wrong places. Such a great intro to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this search for wisdom. Okay, so how do we find wisdom? Here's Pastor John later in that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">very same message. And now finally, I want to give you five brief instructions as to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">how to get this wisdom. These have been really helpful for me to think about again. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">think they all come from Scripture. I'll try to show that they do. Step number one, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">must desire it, hunger for it, long for it. Proverbs 4, 8, "Prize her highly and she will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">exalt you. She will honor you for your embrace." Those are not cheap words. When you prize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">something and you embrace something, you love it intensely. And therefore, wisdom has to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">be valuable to us. We have to want it and crave it. Otherwise, we will not get it. Second,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">since wisdom is found in the word of God, we have to apply ourselves to meditate upon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the word and study the word of God. And I want to add to that this, not only applying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">yourselves to the scriptures firsthand, but also giving yourself to read the finest wisdom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of the best students of the word for the past 1900 years. Read great theological books,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">books that distill the wisdom of God down and help us gain a sense of the sweep of God's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">revelation and insight into the true meaning of Scripture. It would be folly for us all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to start from scratch when there's so much help to be had in great books. And now I want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to give you something really encouraging, because I know what goes through many of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">minds when I say that. I don't have the time nor the ability to get anywhere with that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of literature. If you're talking about great books of theology, I don't believe that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">true. Great books are always great because they're readable, not because they're obscure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Obscure books are not great books. Now, here's the most encouraging thing I can think to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">say to you this morning. My pastor told me four years ago it changed my life. Here it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is. Suppose that you can read about 250 words a minute. Now, that's not real fast. Most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of us can do that. Two hundred fifty words a minute. OK, and suppose that you set aside</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">15 minutes a day to read a great book, a classic or some book that you've been longing to read</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that would help you grow in your wisdom, your understanding. Now, 15 minutes a day for 365</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">days is five thousand four hundred and seventy five minutes a year. Now you multiply five</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">thousand four hundred and seventy five times 250 and you get one million three hundred</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and sixty eight thousand seven hundred and fifty words that you could read in a year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">at 15 minutes a day. Now, an average book has about three hundred and fifty to four</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">hundred words on a page. So we take three or three hundred to four. So we'll take three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">hundred and fifty, which is kind of in the middle and divide that into one million three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">hundred and sixty eight thousand seven hundred and fifty.

An average book has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">about 200 pages. You see the implication of that? You could read 20 books by this time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">next year, setting aside 15 minutes a day. I tell you, when I heard that, I ran home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I sat down. I got out my calendar. I looked for that 15 minutes slot and I found it just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">before supper at five fifteen because I diddle away that that time every night and I set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">myself to do it. And I read Jonathan Edwards original sin, which is a fat book in two months</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">at 15 minutes a day. And then I went on to see us, Lewis and George McDonald, lots of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">other things I've been wanting to read and read. God's all that reading that I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there's no hope.

Was now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">getting done because there was a 15 minute slot that I was using that had formerly been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">thrown away. There is hope. You people who think that there's no hope there is. You have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">15 minutes. You have 15 minutes. Say the 15 minutes just before you go to bed at night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Go to bed. Pick out a great classic like John Calvin's Institutes or Martin Luther's bondage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of the will or commentary on Galatians or John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress or Jonathan</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Edwards, religious affections or some great book you just been itching to read and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, there's no way and read it at 15 minutes a day. A big tree can be chopped down with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">lots of little chops. That's a great incentive, I think, to get wisdom. And then third, we'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUt356IZrBY&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">just briefly cover these last three.
