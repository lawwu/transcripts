I think there were other people around and SpaceX is also running out of money and so we put money to SpaceX operation we were just basically over the years but it was never as existential in terms of the operations it was a Tesla.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSKEz_8FDIk&t=248">00:04:08.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean Tesla was truly I think truly existential and because we were operating guys and I myself had been a factory manager I worked in all the parts and all parts factory I'd run industrial facilities myself we could kind of uniquely add value there in the rocket factory you know we were just less valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

business the business we are all in is that we get to back amazing people that are trying to change the world and in these dark dark dark deep moments we get to go to war for them and in those moments I call them these moments of fellowship where you just care deeply about someone and passionate about the mission.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
