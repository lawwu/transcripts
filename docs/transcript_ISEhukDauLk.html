And back in January of 2010, he was asked to respond to this question, "I believe in the doctrine of election, but I don't like it.</p><p>Is it a sin for me to not like the doctrine of election?" Here's what Pastor John had to say. It's sin not to like the true doctrine of election. It's sin not to like what God likes. Now, I would want to say it like that because many people have conceptions of doctrines, all kinds of doctrines, that are inaccurate and therefore their good hearts dislike them.</p><p>So you could say, "I dislike election," and be a good person because you don't see election clearly. And what you're disliking should be disliked. Or you may be a person who is starting to see it clearly and your old self, which is bad, is rising up and not liking what ought to be liked.</p><p>So I don't know whether this person should be chastised or not. So the principle would be, to the degree that you see biblical truth clearly, you should like it. Now, hell is a biblical truth. So when I say you should like hell, what I mean is the way God does.</p><p>God says He's not willing that any should perish. God does not delight in the death of the wicked. God afflicts us, but not from His heart, Lamentations 3. So there is in God Himself a willing that hell be, and liking that it exists in that big picture, and yet grieving over sending anybody there.</p><p>And so the word "like" is just a little bit difficult here, because you're going to have to do double perspectives again. If God ordains that Jerusalem be destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar, should we like that? And my answer is a yes and no. We should not like women boiling their children, but we should approve of God's decision that it happen.</p><p>And so there's a double perspective in which the things that you see in the small lens should be disliked, and in the bigger lens, liking that God would run the world this way. That was Pastor John Piper. And speaking of the doctrine of election, Pastor John's latest book is now out.</p><p>It's titled "Five Points Towards a Deeper Experience of God's Grace," and it was published by Christian Focus. Chapter 6 is all about election, and you can download it right now by downloading the entire book as a PDF, free of charge, at DesiringGod.org. There, if you click on "Resource Library" and then "Books," you'll find it.</p><p>"Five Points Towards a Deeper Experience of God's Grace." I'm your host, Tony Ranke. Thanks for listening.</p></div></div></body></html>
