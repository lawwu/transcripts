Should we work harder? Should we rest? Should we spend more money? Should we save more money? For everyone listening, I don't know what your life looks like. I don't know who you are, what your dreams are. What's important is to recognize that there's a balance between these two things.</p><p>And being honest with yourself and intentional is the only way to do this and create peace in your life. There's no way that I can tell someone, hey, you're 25, you need to grind, you need to bear it out for the next five years. Or, hey, you're grinding it out, but you hate your job, you need to quit.</p><p>This is a delicate balance here where you need to make the decisions for your own life. I just think it's important to set up these questions because within these questions, within this paradox, is everything that it means to be alive. We have to balance all of these forces. The more intentional that we are, the more time that we give to thinking about this, naturally we learn to do what we know we should do.</p><p>And I think that's an important thing.</p></div></div></body></html>
