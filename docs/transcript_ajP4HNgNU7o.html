But you have to really listen to how you feel and how your body's responding to something.</p><p>And this is one of those perennial, timeless debates within philosophy and spirituality where it's like, do I try to think my way through this or do I trust my intuition? The longer that I've been an entrepreneur, the longer I've been financially independent, the more I recognize that your intuition is actually the strongest gift that you have.</p><p>And most of us just silence it. We just keep doing the thing that we've always done because we feel like that's what we are supposed to do. And it's often the easiest thing to do. And so you end up in a place in your life where all these limits have been set by someone else.</p><p>And you're like, geez, how did I get here? How can I change this up a little bit?</p></div></div></body></html>
