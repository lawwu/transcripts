I think there are people for whom always trying to have a brand new card open so they can put all their expenses on that card so they can always be working towards a welcome bonus.</p><p>I think if that is the scenario that's most high yield for you, I think that makes so much sense. I very rarely open new cards now. And part of it is I've been doing this for a long time. So I have all of the cards I consider to be actual foundational points earning cards that I want to use on a regular basis.</p><p>But also because it no longer makes sense for me to constantly be trying to open cards. And so I think the first step is really looking at, again, what, where am I going to get kind of no pun intended, the biggest bang for my buck. And so for me right now, it's things like having credit cards that give me really, really great bonus points earning for my everyday spend when I'm not actually working on a welcome bonus.</p></div></div></body></html>
