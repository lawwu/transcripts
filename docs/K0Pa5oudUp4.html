That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the way we get to the classic liberal market-based system we want for the ESIs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

Maybe I'll start a bit about actually looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">at what the private world would look like. And I think this is part of where the "there's no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">alternative" comes from. And then let's look at what the government project looks like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">what checks and balances look like, and so on. All right. Private world. First of all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of people right now talk about open source. And I think there's this misconception that AGI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">development is going to be like, "Oh, it's going to be some beautiful decentralized thing and some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">giddy community of coders who gets to collaborate on it." That's not how it's going to look like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">A hundred-billion-dollar, trillion-dollar cluster, it's not going to be that many people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that have it. The algorithms, it's like right now, open source is kind of good because people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">just use the stuff that was published. And so basically, the algorithms were published.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Or as Mistral, they just kind of leave DeepMind and take all the secrets with them and they just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of replicate it. But that's not going to continue to be in the case. And so, the open</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">source alternative... Also, people say stuff like, "1026 flops, it'll be in my phone." No, it won't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like Moore's Law is really slow. AI chips are getting better. But the hundred-billion-dollar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">computer will not cost a thousand dollars within your lifetime or whatever, aside from AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So anyway, it's going to be two or three big players on the private world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so look, a few things. So first of all, you talk about the enormous power that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">superintelligence will have and that the government will have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's pretty plausible that the alternative world is that one AI company has that power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And specifically, if we're talking about lead, it's like, "What? No, no, no. OpenAI has a six-month</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">lead." So then you're talking about basically the most powerful weapon ever, and you're kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">making this radical bet on a private company CEO as the benevolent dictator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">No, no. Not necessarily. Any other thing that's privatized, we don't count on that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">being benevolent. Look, think of, for example, somebody who manufactures industrial fertilizer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The person with this factory, if they went back to an ancient civilization,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">they could blow up Rome.

There's a lot of people who control the water supply or whatever, and we can count on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">cooperation and market-based incentives to basically keep a balance of power.

I mean, what do we do with nukes, right? The way we keep the nukes in check</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is not like a sort of beefed-up Second Amendment, where each state has their own little nuclear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">arsenal, and Dario and Sam have their own little nuclear arsenal.

In fact, the government having the biggest guns was sort of an enormous civilizational</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">achievement, like Landfrieden in the Holy Roman Empire. If somebody from the town over committed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a crime on you, you didn't start a big battle between the two towns.

It's a big achievement. Now, the thing about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">industrial fertilizer, I think the key difference is speed and offense-defense balance issues,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">right?

That is an incredibly scary period,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and it is incredibly scary because you're going through just this enormous array of destructive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Pa5oudUp4&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">technology and this enormous amount of basically military advance.
