I think we can see this happening. For example, you can go these days from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">English, English to code, by asking AI to, for example, rewrite a readme file.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">We can also do code to English, for example, asking AI to document functions in our code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is not all.

And sometimes we only have like a fraction of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of the time, maybe 30%, that we're spending on actually what, you know, creates joy in kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the creative tasks in software development. And this is what led us at AWS, this inspired us to create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Amazon Q.

And this is much more than just a coding assistant. Q developer actually uses agents to perform</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">much more complex tasks and help you automate those. For example, feature development and also code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.240</a></span> | <span class="t">transformation. Think about working with old Java based code bases that you need to migrate maybe to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.440</a></span> | <span class="t">your newer Java version. And to show you how this works, I asked my colleague, Mike Chambers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to put together a quick demo. Let's have a look.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Mike Chambers: With Amazon Q installed inside of my IDE, I can go to new tab and I can start a conversation with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Amazon Q developer and I can do the kinds of things that maybe you'd expect, such as how can I create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a serverless application? And how do I get started? And the chat session brings back a list of instructions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of what I should do, starting off by installing AWS SAM CLI, how to do that, where to get that from,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and how to step through the creation of a project. Now, if I've done that, then serverless SAM, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">might actually come back with some generated code. And here is that code. Maybe I don't quite know what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this code does. So I can right click on the code and send it to Amazon Q asking Amazon Q to explain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And the code then will go into a prompt along with explain and generate an answer. And this is great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">for code that's been generated for us. But also imagine code for legacy systems, something that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">worked on years ago by somebody else, where you can get Amazon Q to help explain it. We can also get Amazon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Q to generate code. Now, this is, again, probably the kind of thing you'd expect. I can put in a comment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">line inside of my code. In this case, I want to create an input checking function. I'm going to give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it some more definition here that I actually want it to trim any string that's being sent into this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">function. And yes, Amazon Q can generate this small function. Well, that's great. But what about if I've got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">more code that I need to have generated? Well, I can go to the chat and put in /dev. And I can put in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">much more comprehensive description of something that I would like. In this particular case, I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to ask for it to write a function to search by category in DynamoDB with a bunch of details about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the way that I want the output to be formatted. So this is much more than just a single or a few lines</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of code. And in this particular case, what's going to happen is it will come back again with a step-by-step</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">list of what's required. So I need to add in template.yaml. It's recommending that I create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">search by category.mjs and many more things.

This is actually a plan. And it's a plan that Amazon Q can actually follow for us. So it generates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">some code as a change set something that we can look at the difference between our current code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and what it suggests.

And it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">will add all of that code into our project way more than just a couple of lines. So Amazon Q developer is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.840</a></span> | <span class="t">much more than just code completion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.

So make sure you're checking those expo sessions. And we also do have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">session at our AWS booth here.

Start prototyping and building with AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And the fun includes a couple of steps, right?

And this is really an important topic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">When you're evaluating models, you have to really evaluate them thoroughly, because most likely,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">there's not just going to be one size fits all for you. In fact, if you look at all your use cases</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to implement, there's likely no one model to rule them all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is why we developed Amazon Bedrock.

Last week, together with Entropic's launch,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we integrated Cloud 3.5 Sonnet on Amazon Bedrock as well, so you can also, since last week, use this model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Super exciting.

And we continuously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">innovate and trying to make it easier for you to build applications across the different model types.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And just a few weeks ago, we introduced a new unified Converse API on Amazon Bedrock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And what does this do? The unified Converse API helps you with a new unified method structured invocation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">meaning you can use the same parameters and bodies regardless of which model you choose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And we are on the platform side. We're handling this translation if parameters are called different for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the different models, handling the system user assistant prompts for you, and also giving you a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">consistent output format. And as well, having native function calling support in here. But let me show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you how this looks in code. So here's the Python example that shows how you can use the new API.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">This is Python, so we're starting by just integrating the Python SDK client here. And then you can define</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this list of messages. And here's, for example, where you put in your user message prompts. You can put in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">system prompts as well. And then this message list, you can just pass in this single API call using the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Converse API here. In the model ID, you can choose which model you want to test. Here I'm using an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">entropic model. And then pass the messages and also the inference parameters. And again, in this API,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.240</a></span> | <span class="t">all those parameters are standardized, and we're going to make the work behind the covers to convert this to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=778" target="_blank">00:12:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the specific format that the model is expecting. So you have an easy way to work across different models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Similarly, here for function calling, we do have the support built in that with the models that support it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So how we implement this is by defining a tool list. So tool here equivalent to the functions you want to give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">access to. And then when you're doing the Converse API call, you can pass this list of tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.

All right. Now let's integrate AI into our applications. And this can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">be a whole session in its own, but I want to focus on one of the hottest topics right now that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.360</a></span> | <span class="t">discussing during the conference, which is, of course, agents. And I have one more demo here, and I asked my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">colleague Mike last time to put together an exciting demo to show you what you can do with agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Mike. And we need sound.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">To be able to create agentic workflows right inside of the AWS console and inside of the service. It works</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">fully serverless, and I've used it to create an agent that plays Minecraft. Let me show you how I did it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">If we jump into the AWS console, go down the menu on the left-hand side to agents, you can see the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">agent screen here, and I can open up my agent, my Minecraft agent. Now, if I just go into agent builder</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and just expand the screen out a little bit, you get to see some of the parameters that I used to create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this agent. So you can see the large language model I used, in this case, Claude3 Haiku. And you can also see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this, the instructions for the agent. Now, this is not some notes for myself. This is actually prompt engineering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that we're doing to explain how we want the agent, in this case, the Minecraft bot, to play the game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we also have to add some tools in, right, some Minecraft tools. So we do that through actions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and inside of action groups. So I've got a couple of different action groups. We've got Minecraft actions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and Minecraft experimental. Let's have a look at actions. And inside of here, we can see some really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.520</a></span> | <span class="t">simple things, some actions that the bot will be able to do. And these are all linked up to code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've got the action to jump. We've got the action to dig. And you can see the description here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">for action to dig. It's got some instructions. Again, this is prompt engineering. And then we've got some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">parameters that we can select, collect. In fact, we require these parameters. So the bot needs to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">these for us. If I scroll down a little further, there's a couple of really simple actions in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Action to get a player location, and action to move to a location. I want to show you those in action,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">because the bot can actually problem solve and reason its way to be able to use these tools to solve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.560</a></span> | <span class="t">simple problems. Let's jump into the game. And so it is nighttime. So let's set it to be the daytime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So that we can see what's going on. So set time to day. Okay. And there in the middle of the screen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you can see Rocky. Rocky is the bedrock agent running inside of the game. And we can talk to it. We can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">have a chat session. But what about if we want it to come to us? Now, there is no tool to come to us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm just going to back up a little bit further, make it a little bit more of a challenge. And I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">going to say, come to me in chat. And what's going to happen now is that the agent's going to reason</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">through a whole set of actions. It's going to look to see who requested that. It's then going to take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that name, and that's my name. And it's going to find the location of that player. And then it's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">map a path from where it currently was to me.

This is super exciting. I'm discovering new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Ir4TMMbS0&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">things that this bot can do every day.
