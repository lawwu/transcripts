It's very important for the vibes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.700</a></span> | <span class="t">that are run. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Let's go. All right. So I'm here to talk about Quadplay's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Pokemon because there's some new stuff that our models can do that is really exciting and makes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the models better at Pokemon, makes the models better at a lot of things, makes the models better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">at being agents. What this is actually going to practically look like, and I'll show some examples</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">later in some slides I have after we're done, is that our models will learn and adapt and think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">differently. So in a minute, we're going to get to the name entry screen. One of my favorite examples I show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">later is that. The name entry screen, a notoriously challenging place for Quad. Quad does not quite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">understand how cursors move around, and it gets a little bit lost. It's a grid. It gets confused.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the things that it's really good at with this extended thinking mode is building a full plan of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.620</a></span> | <span class="t">where it needs to move, what it needs to do, that thing between tool calls. So in the past, it might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">not use that extended thinking, reconsider its assumptions, question itself, figure out the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">answer. In Quad 4, you will see that happen. Another feature we added in this new version of Quad that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have been asked for a lot is the ability to call multiple tool calls at once. So parallel tool calling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is the other name. In Quad 3.7, it was like frustratingly bad at this. It would only call one tool at any given time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And what that means for you is practically when you're building an agent, it'll call one tool and then it will wait.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You'll have to make a whole new generation. You'll get a whole time to first token hit between generations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.580</a></span> | <span class="t">With the new models, they are much more keen to call multiple tools. We actually saw it right at the beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I haven't seen it since. But it will do things in Pokemon, like take an action and update its memory at the same time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">which essentially just saves us tokens when we're building agents. The model is going to take more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">actions more quickly and not need to go through the plan act loop as often. Tool use has evolved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">rapidly in the last year. When I first started helping customers with tool use last year, a lot of it was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">let's use a calculator, give the model a calculator tool so it can do math because the model is bad at math,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">so it has this ability to spill over. These days, that is not what tool use gets used for. Tool use is the driver of agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">When people build with tools, they give models full suites of tools that enable models to take long,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">agentic actions and move forward. And so in that the agentic tool or loop, it really revolves around tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">In an agentic loop, the model will plan an action, act on whatever that plan was, learn something from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">what it saw, and then repeat that until it's accomplished its goals. In Pokemon, it might say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to try to talk to my mom right now. The way it would do that is I'm going to press A,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and then it will reflect, see the dialog box come up, and see it worked, and keep going with its job</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to play Pokemon. So let's talk about those two big improvements we talked about with tool calling in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Quad 4. The first is improved planning. By being able to use extended thinking mode between tool calls,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you are now able to see the model actually break down, build plans, step back, reflect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">question its assumptions between tool calls. And by calling multiple tools at once, the models will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">be more efficient when acting as agents. This has a practical impact in Pokemon that we also didn't get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to see. So I want to talk a little bit about this interleaved thinking, thinking between tool calls,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">because there's some clear examples in Pokemon of how this works out. In the past, when you launched</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it, we actually saw -- this is the one thing we actually did saw -- is when you hit run on a model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it would build the whole plan for how it was going to be Pokemon in its first message.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">This was a terrible plan it would write. It would say, I'm going to write my name down as Claude,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm going to give my Pokemon nicknames, and I'm going to go beat Pokemon, and that's the extent of its</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">planning. And then it would hit a really big, horrible challenge, which is the name entry screen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and everything would fall apart. It would occasionally hit left to move the cursor to a new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">letter and accidentally wrap around to the other side of the screen and think, how the heck did my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">cursor end up on the right side of the screen? The game must be bugged. Everything is terrible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And now with the ability to do extended thinking between tool calls, you'll see the model actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of catch these errors more often, adjust, adapt its thinking, and come up with a better plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this example, this is an actual trace from Quad 4 Opus where it says, I'm really stumped. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">cursor went right instead of left when I hit left. What happened? And then it will actually say, wait,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">let's step through. What actually happened? Where did the cursor go? It was at this letter, this letter,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this letter. Actually, what I think happened is the cursor spilled over and wrapped around to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">other edge. Everything's okay. I understand how this works now. Let's keep going with name entry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and it can sort of pick that up and learn it. And that ability to adapt on the fly is really meaningful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">as you build agents that are kind of expected to take in tons of new information as they're building.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Similarly, we have parallel tool calling. Parallel tool calling, more of an efficiency game. In the past,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">when you're sitting there waiting to talk to mom, the model would press A, talk. And then if it wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to update its knowledge base to keep track of where it found mom in the past, it would have to take a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">whole nother action, call out to quad again, wait for the time to first token hit, make that change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">With parallel tool calling, it can do both things at once, basically. It can say, I'm going to talk to mom. I'm going to update my knowledge base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to advance the dialogue six times by pressing A six times because I'm bored talking to mom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">This saves you time. It saves your customers time. It speeds up how agents work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And it will make agents work more effectively for your customers that won't have to wait around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">for sort of redundant tool calling and calls to the cloud.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what this means, and what's next, is that models are getting better at being agents.

We find ways to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">make models smarter when they're acting over long time horizons and solving complex problems.

It's something we've seen make a real impact on how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">effective agents are in the real world. But I also want to talk about like Quad</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is being trained to be a useful agent and an easier one to build with. When we build our models,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we try to listen to developers. We understand what it means to give Quad the capabilities that make it work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">more easily, more seamlessly, better for users. And we train those into our models too. Things like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">parallel tool calling that we want to hear feedback and improve our models on model over model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I will let some people ask questions. We can chat about this a little bit. Yeah. Over here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey. Hi. Thanks. Cloud-based Pokemon is awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So one question I had was, so you have many low level actions, right, which is like click button A,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">click button B. And then you also have some high level actions like go to this point that you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">previously visited. That's one of the high level actions. Are all these in the same hierarchy of tools?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Or how do you think of, because when you're building any agent, like, you know, you have some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of zoomed out view action that you want to take and then some zoomed in click a button action.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep. How do you think of this? And should it be flat? Should it be like a hierarchy? How do you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">think of this? Thanks. I think like designing any agent, designing tools tends to be the thing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">actually matters the most. And this is like the most simple set of tools. In fact, like I've A in for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">simplicity with Pokemon. It's somewhat a bad example in this sense. But what really matters is being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">clear, like separating the concerns of what tool should be used when, giving good examples of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">what tools should be used when, and how to do that. And so in the case of Pokemon, I have this tool that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">allows the model to navigate to a specific place. And then you have to just be very clear to it that it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">should use that when it's trying to move around in the overworld. It's like I have, I watched Claude play a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">bunch and I found out that the model was quite bad at moving around in the overworld zone. And so just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">basically telling it, hey, you're not good at this. When you're trying to do this set of tasks, this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the right tool to use. You'll have a better outcome. Versus if you're in a battle, just pressing buttons</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">directly. You're perfectly capable of it's easier for you. That's a good way to do it. And so I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">about sort of like the loop of building these, learn, like watch the model, see where it struggles,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">try to design and build tools that will help some of the places it struggles, and then write clear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">descriptions that help the model understand what you have seen, like what its shortcomings are, what it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">why it might need this tool, what scenarios, and equip it with that knowledge. I think there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">microphone here. Yes. There's a pattern in which if you have like a bunch of tool functions and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">don't want to necessarily like clutter your current context with like a whole huge list, you adopt a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">helper, which kind of acts like a proxy where the model can say, hey, I want to accomplish this. And then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, so you know what I'm talking about. Have the dynamics of that particular pattern use changed at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">all with the new model? I don't think we, like I have not studied and I don't think we really know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">how that will break down with the new model. My expectation is that like telling, the smarter a model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">gets, the more I trust it with the full context and to make complex decisions. So my gut with building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">with Opus would be, or Sonnet really, like the Cloud 4 models, is giving it the full list. And again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe you're guessing about like context clutter and just like avoiding if the tools are too long or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe don't click. Yeah, and a quick follow-up, like how many, how many has that at least gotten in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">experience, like how many tools have done? I think we've pretty confidently seen the model be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">navigate order of like 50 to 100 tools. It's just a question of definition though. Like the more as a human who writes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">prompts and writes tools out, the more that you, more tools you write, the less likely it is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to be precise enough and where and how you can actually define those tools to the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and sort of like divide the lines between them. And so from my perspective, it's a little bit like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">well-designed that that's possible. If it gets complicated or nuanced or the too much overlap,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's where you need to start figuring out like patterns to delegate larger chunks of work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or things like that. So when you say that we should give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">clear descriptions of what tools should be used when, does that belong in the prompt or does that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">belong in the tool description? I ask because I've been working on agentic features myself and I find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that if I pass in a JSON schema where I tell it about every field and description in a way that's opinionated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">about what it's going to do, like that's generally worked better for me. But on the other hand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I see these architecture advancements with remote MCP servers where tools can be defined once and used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in many other use cases. So I'm not really sure what to do. Yeah, it's a great question. My lean is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">often to put things in a tool description, but honestly, I think you can do both. I mean, when you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the way that our prompt gets rendered when you provide tools in a tool description is it just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">renders the tools in the system prompt. And so mechanically, the gap in text between if you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">write it in the tool description and just below it in the system prompt is not that much. And I think it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">matters more to just have clear descriptions and to be clear about what it is. I think the thing that's nice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">about putting in a tool description is you're sort of like separating what tool you're talking about when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">more like the way that we've trained it, we're sort of like guaranteeing that the syntax that is used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">for the model to like read and understand a tool description is something it's seen before. Whereas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">if you venture off that path, there's a risk that you're going to do something that's not as easy for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">them all to understand. But I think like if you write a really strong prompt, it should work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">similarly well in both situations, I'd expect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So 3.5 Sonic got stuck in Mount Moon for a while.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Can it make it out?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It will make it out.

But the ways</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that it's better are not the most satisfying ways if you want to see Pokemon get beat. It's like roughly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">as enabled to see the Pokemon, the Game Boy screen as it was before.

That's not what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">our customers are asking for.

And it's like this ability to sort of plan and execute, like build a plan,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and then like actually track and execute against that over, in this case, like 100 million tokens worth of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">information was like by far the best I've ever seen from a model. So in this playthrough, as you watch at home,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">as you watch on the demo thing, I think you'll see it gets stuck in Mt. Moon for probably a similar amount of time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=913" target="_blank">00:15:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">if I had to guess. But you'll see it do some like miles more intelligent things in the process of getting there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Funny how it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Hey, I just have a question about parallel tool calling. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">First time I've ever, is this state of the art? I haven't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, no. A model should be able to do this. I think like, frankly, like I wish 3.7 could have done this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think this is like an insane capability, but it matters. Like it's just a useful thing for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">people to be able to do. So just under the hood in your messages array that you're interacting with the model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">are you just doing some magic on your end to kind of free?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's kind of like on the model to say, hey, I'm done. I've described a set of tool calls I want to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm done or not. So the model in the past would just like make one tool call and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to wait for the result of this. The model now is more likely to understand that in some cases,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually know two or five or eight tool calls that I want to make right now. And it will describe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">all of those. And then the object you get back in the API is, has eight tool use blocks that say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">here are the eight tools I want to use. And then you're asked to go sort of like render those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Awesome. Thank you. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm particularly interested with the idea, right? So with parallel tool calls,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">there are some cases where it's obvious that all the tool calls can actually happen in parallel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But then there's like more of a planning sense where you showed like press A, press A, press A.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so of course, I'm like thrown back to being six in my mom's minivan and remembering when I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">restarted a really long conversation because I was spamming A. Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'm just like, I'm nerdily curious if that, if it's ever done that where it's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">impatiently restarted a conversation. All the time. All the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think that that also like scratches out a deeper thing of like, is there ever such a thing as too,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">too much planning and do you see it like being too opinionated about following the plan and not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">updating with new information like the conversation has ended?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this is like the range for good prompting, honestly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The so the reason that it actually hits many buttons is you'll see its thought process say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to hit a whole bunch of buttons and I'll stop whenever it's done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But it doesn't like quite have the sense of time like we do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So if it says I want to hit a 500 times, it's like, oh, don't worry, I'll be I'll know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">when I have finished the dialogue and then I'll stop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But it doesn't quite understand that it doesn't get to see in between each one by default.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1058" target="_blank">00:17:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Because like the nature, I don't know, that's a very LLM problem that you have to register 500</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">buttons and then close your eyes and then come back and find out what happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can actually get around that just like with prompting and helping the model understand what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">happening, what are its limitations and what and how should it act.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So like in the system prompt for quad place Pokemon, I just have to tell it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">when you register a sequence of buttons, you don't get to see like you're not going to see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there could be side effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Restarting the dialogue is a simple version, but you can actually do like much worse things in Pokemon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I've seen it overwrite one of its moves accidentally when it was learning a new move</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in a way that was like quite bad for for making progress in the game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is like I think the space where someone building agents, you have a lot of room to sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">see how models make mistakes like that, help them understand why and what's going on and sort of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">build that into how you prompt them prompt agents. And that's a lot of how I think about sort of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1119" target="_blank">00:18:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">iterating on agent design.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1120" target="_blank">00:18:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So in our production agent, we saw that in 3.7, there was some not very good consistency with calling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">about 18 tools versus like if you were to just pass the model a single tool and then just have the exact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">same prompt and have it call that. And you mentioned before that the four models are able to handle like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">over 100 tools. Are there any changes or differences you're seeing in how you get consistent performance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1149" target="_blank">00:19:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">amongst so many tools?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1150" target="_blank">00:19:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I think these models we've pretty clearly seen are much better at precise instruction following.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XUzn-DEoY8&t=1157" target="_blank">00:19:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">This can be a double-edged sword.
