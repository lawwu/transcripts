This is such a vast and complicated question. You might as well be asking what is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxQMdk6jCKU&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">meaning of life.

And so we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxQMdk6jCKU&t=1962" target="_blank">00:32:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">did was we created a block in the afternoon, we've been testing where three writers will get together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxQMdk6jCKU&t=1966" target="_blank">00:32:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in a pod, and they work on a newsletter together. So instead of three writers writing three different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxQMdk6jCKU&t=1971" target="_blank">00:32:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">newsletters, you have three writers collaborate on three different newsletters, they do one for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxQMdk6jCKU&t=1975" target="_blank">00:32:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">two hours, one for two hours, one for 90 minutes, one for 90 minutes. And then the total</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxQMdk6jCKU&t=1978" target="_blank">00:32:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of three people read the newsletters.

It's kind of how developers work or sales teams work with leads. And then in things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxQMdk6jCKU&t=2005" target="_blank">00:33:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like programming, like pair programs, like peer program, exactly. And then with and it also,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxQMdk6jCKU&t=2008" target="_blank">00:33:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">makes people less lonely, and it builds social fabric.

And when I see people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxQMdk6jCKU&t=2052" target="_blank">00:34:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in a changelog, and I see they made no commits, I'm like, what is this person doing? They said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxQMdk6jCKU&t=2056" target="_blank">00:34:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">they did all the strategy stuff.

Because in an office, people are also performative. They're doing like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxQMdk6jCKU&t=2078" target="_blank">00:34:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">bullshit meetings.

So that was the temptation for all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxQMdk6jCKU&t=2116" target="_blank">00:35:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">these companies to go remote is it made hiring so much easier.

And yet the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxQMdk6jCKU&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">unemployment rate is still in the 3% range. And the reason is because that if somebody drops out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxQMdk6jCKU&t=2157" target="_blank">00:35:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of the labor force,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxQMdk6jCKU&t=2158" target="_blank">00:35:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and isn't looking for work, they don't get counted in the unemployment rate.
