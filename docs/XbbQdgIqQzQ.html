There's cognitive behavioral therapy.

Yeah. So one basic assumption is that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=19" target="_blank">00:00:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">mind isn't unitary, that actually we're all multiple personalities, not in the diagnostic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.740</a></span> | <span class="t">sense. But we all have these, what I call parts, other systems call sub-personalities, ego states,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">things like that. And that it's the natural state of the mind to be that way, that we're born with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=43" target="_blank">00:00:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">them because they're all very valuable and have qualities and resources to help us survive and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">thrive. But trauma and what's called attachment injuries and the slings and arrows we suffer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">force these little naturally valuable parts into roles that can be destructive. Often they don't like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.020</a></span> | <span class="t">it all. But because they're frozen often in time and during the trauma and they live as if it's still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">happening, they're in these protective roles that can be quite extreme and interfere in your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, so I just stumbled onto the phenomena of 40, now I think it's 41 years ago. And it's been,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.020</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, amazing ride. So at the time were you already practicing as a clinical psychologist?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually have a PhD in Maryland family therapy. So I was part of the movement in family therapy away from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">intrapsychic work. There was a polarization and we thought we could reorganize families and heal all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.860</a></span> | <span class="t">symptoms just by doing that. We didn't have to muck around in the inner world. And I went to prove that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was about 1983, by getting a group of bulimic kids together and their families and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">tried to reorganize the families just the way the book said to and failed. The kids didn't realize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">they'd been cured and they kept binging and purging. So out of frustration, I began asking why? And they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.140</a></span> | <span class="t">started talking this language of parts. And they would say some version of when something happens, bad happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.980</a></span> | <span class="t">in my life. It triggers this critic who's calling me all kinds of names inside. And that goes right to the heart of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">part that feels empty and alone and worthless. And that's so distressing to feel that the binge part comes in and takes me out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">takes me away from all that pain. But the critic comes in and attacks me for the binge. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">the criticism goes right to the heart of that worthless part. So to me, as a family therapist, this sounded</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.300</a></span> | <span class="t">like what I'd been studying in external families, these circular sequences of interaction. And so I just got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">curious and just started to explore. Are these different parts that exist within each and all of us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.940</a></span> | <span class="t">are they represented by a clear and distinct voice from the other? Or do people typically experience them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.140</a></span> | <span class="t">as just the self, like my inner critic? You'll give us the other names and titles. Or is this happening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">typically below people's conscious awareness? Some of both. So most people are aware they're a critic and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.420</a></span> | <span class="t">but other times you're not aware of these parts we call exiles that you've locked away because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.540</a></span> | <span class="t">you didn't want to feel their feelings. They're stuck in these bad trauma scenes. And to survive in your life,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.220</a></span> | <span class="t">you had to push them away. And so with those parts, a lot of people aren't really consciously aware of them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbbQdgIqQzQ&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">until these protector parts give space and open the door to the exiles.</span></div></div></body></html>
