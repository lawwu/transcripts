It was the first democratic constitution, as I understand it, was like created over the period of four months. It really seems to have stood the test of time.</p><p>Or alternatively, it could be like extremely dangerous. I mean, we'll stick with the US constitution. There were horrible things in there and it was the like legal right to slavery was proposed as like a constitutional amendment. If that had gone in, that would have been like a horrible, a horrible kind of piece of lock-in.</p></div></div></body></html>
