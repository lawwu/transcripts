Thank you. I feel like that's going to mess this up. Let's just go through what requires the most. Holy, holy, holy is pretty straightforward. We just need to build. Let's do Speak, O Lord. Yeah? Speak, O Lord. As we come to you to receive the fruit of your holy word.</p><p>Take your truth, plant it deep in us. Shape and fashion us in your likeness. That the light of Christ might be seen today in our acts of love and our deeds of faith. Speak, O Lord, and fulfill in us all your purposes for your glory. Teach us, Lord. Teach us, Lord, full obedience, holy reverence, true unity.</p><p>Test our thoughts and our attitudes in the radiance of your purity. Cause our faith to rise, cause our eyes to see your majesty, love and authority. We're in some power that can never fail. Let their truth prevail over unbelief. Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds. Help us grasp the heights of your plans for us.</p><p>You're the son of change from the dawn of time. That we'll echo down through eternity. And by grace we'll stand upon your promise. And by faith we'll walk as you walk with us. Speak, O Lord, till your church is built. And the earth is filled with your glory. And by grace we'll stand on your promises.</p><p>And by faith we'll walk as you walk with us. Speak, O Lord, till your church is filled. And the earth is filled with your glory. Abide? Oh, you're doing, you're listening to a click? Oh, okay, okay. But then, oh, just the click. Metronome? Okay, okay. Okay, that makes sense.</p><p>Got it. All right. Can we do verse three again? Verse three? Yeah, there was like a part where we kind of stopped. Sure. Verse three? In Speak, O Lord. All right. Okay. I'll let you, I'll let you give the. Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds. Help us grasp heights of your plans for us.</p><p>Truths and changes from the dawn of time That will echo down through eternity And by grace we'll set on your promises And by faith we'll walk as you walk with us Speak, O Lord, till your church spill And the earth's filled with your glory And by grace we'll set on you Okay.</p><p>Okay. Can you, on the tag? Huh? What? Maybe they, maybe adjust it. Maybe they, maybe adjust it. You like dropped out for me. So, you know, can you just give me the tempo then on, at the beginning of the song then? If, if you're doing the click? Because, in this one, because in this one I'm just starting it But if I don't have a reference point, I could be off on yours.</p><p>Like, I'm trying to find the tempo. Oh, really? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Oh, okay. Okay. Where am I getting? I think, uh, to the right. To the tag. Are you going to wait that long before going into it? Yeah, it's about four counts though. Oh, I feel like you should go right into it.</p><p>Oh, wait. Am I doing that? No, I think I'm going right into it. Yeah. Yeah, we're going right into it, yeah. Um, okay.

It sounds different. It sounds, like, very empty. It sounds different. I can hear your guitar. I can hear mine. I can hear mine. I can hear mine.

I just talked about too much. - May that pass? - When I pass through death, as I am to rest, I depend on you. I depend on you. For eternal life, to be raised with Christ.</p><p>I depend on you. I depend on you. I depend on you. I depend on you. I depend on you. You're the way, the truth, and the lies. You're the well that never runs dry. I'm a branch and you are the blind.

Because we didn't, you guys kind of cut it off short. Yeah. I think Joe just went off. Yeah. We're always going to do the F and the B flat. He's confident in what? Having a click? Yeah.</p><p>Like, is the click making it worse? No, it's good. I'll just come in and if I'm wrong. Can you just focus on just giving it everything? And it will be fine. When did you do that? We'll go away. Oh, I guess? Um, what time? I think we've got the time.</p><p>Maybe it's cute. What happened? Uh, let's, let's just go play, go play. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
