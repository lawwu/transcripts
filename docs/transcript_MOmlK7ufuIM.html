Whereas, if you look at the mortgage-backed securities boom and structured products generally in the mid-2000s, the way that people made money in that was just by being very, very detail-oriented and being able to make these incredibly fine-grained distinctions between different products that were basically similar, but one of them pays 5.7% and one of them pays 5.75%.</p><p>And if you lever up that difference enough times, you're actually making really good money consistently. It's super boring, but maybe with enough Adderall, it's actually very tolerable work that you can enjoy. So I do think that just within stimulants, the difference between short-acting stimulants and long-acting stimulants does mean the difference between a hostile takeover boom and a structured products boom.</p></div></div></body></html>
