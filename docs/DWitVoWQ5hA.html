Look where we're at now. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWitVoWQ5hA&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">at the worst of it, the S&P 500 was down almost 24%. We've made back more than half of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWitVoWQ5hA&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in this little bounce here. I think the S&P is up 16% from the lows. The NASDAQ 100 is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWitVoWQ5hA&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">up well over 20%, although it was down much more in the trough.

But I'm sure a lot of people assumed that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWitVoWQ5hA&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">bull market was over in 1987, and stocks crashed 33% in like a week, right? So, you have cyclical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWitVoWQ5hA&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and secular bull and bear markets, and they last at varying lengths.

But this is price only. No dividends included, right? So, if we look at what happened</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWitVoWQ5hA&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.340</a></span> | <span class="t">in that time, including dividends, go to the next chart, John.

Did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWitVoWQ5hA&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">it end at the trough in March 2009 when it stopped?

I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWitVoWQ5hA&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">there's like 25 bull markets on here versus 55 corrections in bear markets. So, obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWitVoWQ5hA&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the negative stuff hits a lot more often.
