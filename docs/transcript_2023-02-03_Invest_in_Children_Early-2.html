Hey Radicals, just five days left before the live class, the big launch of my newest course, HackProofCourse.com. Hack proof, how to beat fraudsters, prevent identity theft, and say goodbye to cybercrime. Sign up today at HackProofCourse.com. Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua Sheets, and today we continue our show on how to invest in your children at an early age. This is part two in this series. I'm a big believer in the value of investing in children at an early age, and I want to give you specific ideas and strategies as to how to accomplish that. Now, the first episode of this series was one in which I focused primarily on what is probably for many of us something that's already done, right? Our selection of a spouse and the contributions that we and our spouse make to our children. Because at the end of the day, a significant component of your children's long-term success is going to be driven quite literally by simply who their parents are. And I spent quite a lot of time talking about who their parents are in terms of their basic genetic material, which is going to drive what our children look like, some of the basics of their health, etc., as well as their cognitive ability, and in terms of the culture that the child's parents are from. Is the child going to be raised in a culture where he has good role models, where he's going to be loved and cared for, etc.? So now we move on and we continue in the earliest stages, and I want to talk about those things that can be done in the very earliest stage of the child's life. Prior to, during, and following conception. Because this is where that raw genetic material of a parent's body and a parent's life is brought into reality, is brought into being, is at the moment of conception. Now, the primary opportunity that we have relating to setting our children up for long-term success is related to good health. A strong and healthy baby is generally produced by strong and healthy mothers and fathers, who continue to be strong and healthy, especially, of course, the mother, after the time of conception. And this is something that we don't talk a lot about, but I believe that it is something that is extremely important and it's something that all of us can impact to some degree or another. Now, perhaps you've already chosen your spouse, you're not changing anything there, you're not going to go out on the marketplace and say, "Well, let me just pick another beautiful person that's going to have, you know, another person with whom I'm going to have a designer baby." So you're married to the person that you're married to, and that's settled, but you're going to have a baby, and you hope to have a baby. What can you do to invest into your child? The biggest thing you can do is going to be based upon health and nutrition. We're going to begin with nutrition. In yesterday's podcast, I shared with you some ideas from the excellent book called Deep Nutrition by, I think it's Katherine Shanahan, and I want to read a little bit of what she has to offer from the perspective of how to invest in nutrition prior to conception, and then, of course, during pregnancy. This is not something that is commonly talked about in our modern world, although I think we do understand it to a greater degree than before. I don't really know a pregnant mother who doesn't take some prenatal vitamins, for example. But I think there's a lot more that we could do if we were very interested in this, and there's a lot more that we probably should do in order to supercharge the long-term benefits for our children. In the book Deep Nutrition, the author talks extensively in the very beginning about the history of studying good health and scientific research. I want to read a couple of comments in terms of traditional cultures. It's very important that we go and we study traditional cultures. Of course, here, the researcher and dentist, American dentist Weston A. Price is probably the most famous figure. But we need to go and study from what our ancestors did in order to understand why what they did worked, because all of us are the recipients of a long line of genetic investment. And it's extremely important to understand that what we do matters. In our modern age, we've been infected with the idea that all sicknesses are caused by germs, that all illnesses can be treated with a pill, and we neglect doing some of the fundamental things that can drive good health. So listen to a little bit of historical analysis and we'll get some specific examples of what mothers and fathers can do prior to the conception of their children in order to invest heavily into your child. During a historical comment from chapter one of this book of Weston A. Price and some of his data, here is an excerpt. "If you believe Price's data, which I do, then clearly our bodies appear to be accustomed to a far richer stream of nutrients than we manage to sip, chew, swallow, or scarf down in our daily diets. Our need for nutrients is apparently quite extraordinary. But what is more extraordinary is the totality to which indigenous cultures, and presumably also our ancestors, involved themselves in the production of these foods. In contrast to our general attitude of nourishment as a necessary evil demanding expediency, traditional life seemed to revolve around collecting and concentrating nutrition. To this end, no methodology and no recipe was too bizarre." I will include here a few examples from Price's book to demonstrate how fully people immersed themselves in the production of food, and a few of the wonderful ingenuities that streamlined this undertaking. In the Scottish Isles, people built their houses using chiefly, the grass that grew abundantly on the moors. The roofs were loosely woven and chimneyless so that the smoke from their cooking fires would pass directly through the thatch. When the roof was removed and rebuilt in the spring after having been infused with mineral-rich ash all winter, the smoke thatch made fantastic fertilizer for their plant crops, chiefly oats. Their oats, in turn, were superior sources of minerals and were incorporated into many dishes. One of the most important was a fish dish made from a baked cod's head, rich in essential fatty acids, that had been stuffed with oatmeal, rich in minerals, and chopped cod livers, rich in vitamins. On the other side of the world, in Melanesia, the original arrivals to the islands had brought with them a member of the pig family bred for its self-sufficiency, at finding forage in the muddy and mountainous landscape. They'd released their hogs into the wild so they could colonize the forests. Soon, the hogs' numbers had grown to the point that one would be hunted down just about anywhere. Every part of the quarry, from snout to tail, would be cooked or smoked or otherwise prepared and eaten. It goes on and gives some other interesting examples, but let's focus on our children. As focused as people were on the production of healthy food, the chief crop and the ultimate prize was the next generation of healthy children. Traditional cultures made a science of it. As we'll see in Chapter 5, Step 1 was planning ahead. Around the world, traditions reflected extensive use of special foods to boost a woman's nutrition before conception, during gestation, for nursing, and for rebuilding before the next pregnancy. Some cultures thought it prudent to fortify the groom's diet in preparation for his wedding ceremony. The shreds of surviving information suggest such knowledge was quite sophisticated. Blackfoot Nation women utilized the still-unknown nutrient systems found in the lining of the large intestine of buffalo, and later cow, to "make the baby have a nice round head." To ensure easy delivery, many cultures reinforced preconception and pregnancy diets with fish eggs and organ meats loaded with fat-soluble vitamins, B12, and omega-3, as well as special grains carefully cultivated to be high in important minerals. The Maasai allowed couples to marry only after spending several months consuming milk from the wet season, when the grass was especially lush and the milk much denser in nutrients. In Fiji, islanders would hike miles down to the sea to acquire a certain species of lobster crab that "tribal custom demonstrated to be particularly efficient for producing a highly perfect infant." Elsewhere, fortifying foods didn't just facilitate pregnancy; they made the difference between the baby making it to term or not. The soil of certain areas around the Nile Delta is notoriously low in iodine, the lack of which can lead to maternal goiter and infant malformation. Local tribes knew that burning water hyacinth, rich in iodine, produced ashes capable of preventing these complications. These ingrained traditions existed throughout the world and, until recently, dictated the ebb and flow of daily life. This kind of dedication, study, and wise use of natural resources is what was required to amass and protect the genetic wealth that enabled people to survive in a very different and harsher wild, wild world. Of course, these days most of us spend our time fighting traffic, not wild boar, but the same nutritional input that toughened and fortified the physiologies of these indigenous peoples can still be accessed today for the attainment of extraordinary health. Were the medical community to bring the same enthusiasm to the engineering and maintenance of healthy bodies as archaeologists bring to their study of ancient architectural wonders, they would soon call for a radical revision of what we understand to be a healthy human diet. The construction of a beautiful, sound building is not a matter of chance, but of planning, good materials, and reference to the collected body of relevant science. Winning the genetic lottery depends upon those very same prerequisites. Today, at every stage in the process of producing food, we do things differently than our sturdy, self-sufficient ancestors did, wasting opportunities to provide ourselves with essential nutrients at every turn. We fail to fortify and protect the substrate on which the life and health of everything depends, the soil. We raise animals in unspeakably inhumane and unhealthy conditions, fill their tissues with toxins, and color the meat to make it appear more appetizing. Being raised on open pasture is no guarantee that an animal's body, an ultimate sacrifice, will be put to full use. Typically, only the muscle is consumed. Much of the nutrients, bioconcentrated over the animal's life, are thrown to waste. Grains, even those grown on relatively healthy soil, are too often processed in ways specifically damaging to the most essential and delicate nutrients. Once in the kitchen, the consumer takes one last swing at whatever nutrition has survived through overcooking and the use of cheap, toxic oils. Finally, since we've not been told that certain vitamins and minerals are more bioavailable when combined with acids or fats, many of them pass right through us. Given that we drop the ball at every stage in the process of bringing food to the table, it's not surprising that recent studies show far from exceeding the RDA, as we should be (RDA is recommended daily allowance), few of us even meet it. For vitamin A, only 46.7% of healthy females meet the RDA, and levels are low in 87% of children with asthma. For vitamin D, 55% of obese children, 76% of minority children, and 36% of otherwise healthy young adults are deficient. For vitamin E, 58% of toddlers between 1 and 2 years old, 91% of preschoolers, and 72.3% of healthy females do not consume enough. 0% of breastfed infants were found to have achieved the minimum recommended intake of vitamin K. For the B vitamins, only 54.7% consumed adequate B2, riboflavin, for folate. Only 2.2% of women between the ages of 18 and 35, and 5.2% of women aged 36 to 50 achieved the recommended intake. And for calcium, fewer than 22% of African American adolescent girls consumed the RDA. There are more studies, but you get the idea. Not one study shows 100% adequacy of any single nutrient, not to mention adequacy of all measurable nutrients, which would be a better goal. Presumably, the vast majority of Americans are deficient in multiple nutrients. Many of my patients suffer from symptoms that could be attributable to poor nutrition. Problems as common as dry skin, easy bruising, frequent runny noses, yeast infections, and crampy digestive systems are all exacerbated by, if not due entirely to, inadequate nutrition. Unfortunately, testing for vitamin adequacy is not easy. We haven't even defined what normal levels are for many nutrients, including essential fatty acids and vitamin K. For those that have been so defined, the normal range may extend all the way down to zero. That's right, you may have none of an essential nutrient in your bloodstream, yet still be considered to have consumed an adequate amount. So, why bother testing? And, since many vitamins are stored in the liver and other tissues, even if blood levels are adequate, overall body stores may be low. As far as I can tell, the best way to assure nutrient adequacy is not with testing, but with adequate nutrient consumption. Goes on and talks about some of the ways that you can achieve that. Now, let's go specifically to her chapter on specifically what we can do to prepare for children, because here we have a significant set of useful information. This is from chapter five, called The Sibling Strategy. Letting your body create a perfect baby. And here is, here are the introductory kind of bullet points. Number one, mom's nutritional status before and during pregnancy influences how much facial and body symmetry her child develops. Remember that facial and body symmetry is a mark of beauty, but more importantly, that beauty is a mark of health. And children who have poor body symmetry suffer from all kinds of health problems caused directly by the inadequate body symmetry. In the context of modern diet, birth order correlates with two distinct symmetry shifts away from ideal. Studies show that most women are nutritionally deficient during childbearing years. Eating sweets and fried foods during pregnancy is likely to be as detrimental as smoking and drinking, if not more so. All evidence suggests that optimizing nutrition represents a powerful strategy for creating healthy, beautiful babies. Almost nothing gives a woman more pride and confidence than the birth of her first child. After one successful pregnancy, there is an understandable expectation that a second pregnancy will go even more smoothly. And perhaps it will, at least for mom. More distensible pelvic issues do facilitate an easier second labor. But unless the mother gives herself ample time, generally at least three years, and enough experience for her body to fully replenish itself, child number two may not be as healthy as his older sibling. And so, while big brother goes off to football practice or big sister gets a modeling job, the second sibling will be spending time in the offices of the local optometrists and orthodontists. It's not that they got the "unlucky genes." The problem is that compared to their older sibling, they grew in a relatively undernourished environment in utero. Timing is everything. Why does being born second sometimes mean a child's body is second rate? For one thing, most American women have no idea how badly they're eating. One study shows that overall, 74% of women are falling short on nutrients from their diet. And I think even that number is optimistic. If most mothers-to-be aren't even taking in enough nutrients for themselves, how can we expect them to properly provide for a growing baby, not to mention one right after the other? But the biggest reason there's often such a difference between number one and number two in cases of rapid-fire conception has to do with how the placenta works. Even minor nutritional deficiencies can hamper baby's growth. So, to better protect baby, nature has provided a built-in safety mechanism, allocating as many resources to the placenta as it can get away with, even if it means putting mom's health at some risk. The baby protection mechanism is so powerful that even on an all-McDonald's diet, a woman can expect to produce a baby with ten fingers and ten toes. Dr. John Dernon of Glasgow University describes the mechanism vividly. "The fetus is well-protected against maternal malnutrition, that indeed it behaves like a parasite, oblivious to the health of its host. If a mom's diet is deficient in calcium, it will be robbed from her bones. If deficient in brain-building fats, as horrible as this sounds, the fats that make up the mother's own brain will be sought out and extracted." Pregnancy drains a woman's body of a wide variety of vitamins, minerals, and other raw materials, and breastfeeding demands more still. As you might expect, the demands of producing a baby draw down maternal stores of a spectrum of nutrients, including iron, folate, calcium, potassium, vitamin D, vitamin A, and carotenoids, magnesium, iodine, omega-3, phosphorus, zinc, DHA, and other essential fatty acids, B12, and selenium. To the placenta, mom's central nervous system, for instance, is simply a warehouse full of the kinds of fat needed to build baby's central nervous system. Studies show that maternal brains can actually shrink, primarily in the hippocampal and temporal lobe areas, which control short-term memory and emotion. These brain regions are not responsible for basic functioning, like breathing or blood pressure regulation, and so are relatively expendable. This marvelous nutrient-scavenging ability of a human placenta means that even in conditions of insufficient maternal nutrition, the first child may come out relatively intact. Meanwhile, mom's body may be depleted to the point that before and after pictures reveal her spine to have curved, her lips thinned, and she may have trouble remembering and learning new things, or feel anxious and depressed, as in postpartum depression. It may sound harsh, but it's just the selfish gene at work. Successful genes behave like greedy pirates, commandeering maternal nutrient stores for the benefit of their own optimal replication. However, any child conceived in too short a time for those storehouses to be refilled will be at a significant disadvantage. In such depleted conditions, where baby to extract from mother all the nutrients its genes would like it to have, this would put mom's life at significant risk. Following the utilitarian calculus of genetic survival, biology pragmatically chooses not to kill the mother while a baby is gestating, and opts instead for a compromise. This second baby will be constructed as well as possible in the depleted conditions in order that mom may pull through. Tragically, this exposes the child to a variety of health problems, which can become increasingly noticeable and even debilitating as they grow older. Here's something else to consider. Sugar and vegetable oils act like chemical static that blocks the signals our bodies need to run our metabolism smoothly. Most women's diets today are high in sugar and vegetable oils, adding to the growth disturbances already caused by missing nutrients. Not only does sugar and vegetable oil consumption disrupt maternal metabolism and lead to gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and other complications of pregnancy, the sugar and vegetable oils streaming through a developing baby's blood block signals in the womb, disrupting the sequence of highly sensitive interdependent developmental events that contribute to the miracle of a healthy birth. The consequences of not getting enough nutrients and the introduction of toxins are primarily brought to bear through changes in the infant's epigenome. It goes on and talks about some of the previous things. So the first thing is birth order, and the author has made a significant study discussing birth order. It's one of the reasons why most of the best-looking people, the most famous models, the most famous movie stars are often the firstborn because they got the full genetic potential of their mother's body. Whereas follow-on children, if there's not adequate time and adequate nutrition for a mother's body to recover, often suffer from being less attractive. And it's interesting, she spent several chapters on it. Now let's pivot and talk about some solutions. Now for a limited time at Delamo Motorsports.

When I was living and working in Hawaii, four generations sometimes came into my clinic for an office visit all at once, giving me a front row view of the impact of modern food. Quite often this is what I saw. Great Grandma, born on her family's farm and well into her 80s, still had clear vision and her own set of teeth. Her weathered skin sat atop features that looked as though they were chiseled from granite. More often than not, she was the healthiest of the bunch and had a thin medical chart to prove it. The youngest child, on the other hand, often presented symptoms of the whole set of modern diseases. Attention deficit, asthma, skin disorders, and recurrent ear infections. Like many of today's generation, one or more of his organs wasn't put together quite right. Maybe there was a hole in his heart, or maybe he needed surgery to reposition the muscles around an eye. While the exact effects may be hard to predict, what is predictable, given the dwindling dietary nutrients and proliferation of toxic materials, is some kind of physiologic decline. Within a given family, the earlier the abandonment of traditional foods for a diet of convenience, the more easily perceptible the decline. I am thinking of one little boy in particular, the great-grandchild of one of Hawaii's many wealthy missionary families who developed an ear infection during his visit to Kauai from another island. This little boy bore none of his great-grandmother's striking facial geometry. His jaw was narrow, his nose blunted and thin, his eyes set too close, and his cheekbones were withdrawn behind plateaus of body fat. The lack of supporting bone under his eyes made his skin sag into bags, giving him a weary look. His ears were twisted, tilted, and protruded, and his ear and mouth were abnormally curved, predisposing him to recurring external ear infections. Narrow face, thin bones, flattened features, sound familiar? This is a dynamic symmetry shift. The nature and degree was something I'd expect to see if he were child number 3 or 4 of siblings born in quick succession. But the young man sitting on my exam table was only the couple's second child, and though mom had given herself a full four years between now and now, it hadn't protected his health. He was the fourth generation product of a century of nutritional neglect and the consequential epigenetic damage. The last century has derailed our entire culture from the traditions that sustained us, so he is far from alone in enduring visible epigenetic damage. And the consequences impact more than a child's skeletal system; their entire genome is at risk. I believe this is why, according to a landmark 2003 Center for Disease Control report, this child, like all others born in 2000, had a 1 in 3 chance of developing diabetes, a condition that reduces life expectancy by between 10 and 20 years. What is going unreported is the fact that it isn't just diabetes on the path. Every year, growing battalions of familiar diseases are cutting a wider and wider swath of destruction through the normal experiences of childhood. Whereas in previous centuries part of a parent's responsibility was to work hard to prevent their children from getting sick, today so many of us are sick ourselves that we've grown to accept disease as one of life's inevitables, even for our children. Today's kids aren't healthy. But rather than make such a sweeping and terrifying declaration, we avert our eyes from the growing mound of evidence, fill the next set of prescriptions, and expand our definition of normal childhood health to encompass all manner of medical intervention. This latest generation of children has accumulated the epigenetic damage of at least the three previous generations due to lack of adequate nutrition, along with the overconsumption of sugar and new artificial fats found in vegetable oils. The family genome has been getting battered relentlessly for almost a century, even during key delicate periods of replication. The physiologic result of these accumulated genetic insults distorted cartilage, bone, brain, and other organ growth. Many physicians have noted an apparent increase in young couples complaining of problems with fertility, which given the implications of epigenetic science should come as no surprise. Children born today, I'm afraid, may be so genomically compromised that for many reproduction will not be possible even with the benefit of high-tech medical prodding. This is why I call these children the Omega Generation, referring to the last letter in the Greek alphabet. Born by caesarean section, often necessitated by maternal pelvic bone abnormalities, briefly breastfed, if at all, weaned on foods with extended shelf lives, the human equivalent of pet foods, these Omega Generation children see the doctor often and, whether firstborn or not, will likely suffer from both biradial and dynamic symmetry shifts. In the same way we talk about bracing for the aging baby boomers' medical needs, we had better reinforce the levies of our medical system for the next rising tide, medicine-dependent youth. These children will age faster, suffer emotional problems, and develop never-before-seen diseases. In my experience as a doctor, parents have an intuitive sense that their children are already dealing with more health problems than they ever did, and they worry about their future for good reason. But no parent is helpless if you have children or are planning to. I can think of at least one child who could do something to avoid all this illness and start getting healthy. Yours. I hope that this narrative is helpful to you and persuasive because I think we can all see it around us with our eyes. If you step back and just look at the – again, I'm from the US-American culture and kind of the Western tradition, but it's so blindingly obvious. The internet made a big brouhaha a couple months ago when people are coming out – I can't remember if it was the FDA or something – but basically coming out and prescribing drugs to fat kids to try to help – drugs and surgery to fat kids to try to help them lower their body weight. It's insane. And what has happened as a culture, we have been desensitized to believe our eyes. We've swallowed as a culture the mirage of expertise, thinking that, well, the smart people must have done great science and therefore we should listen to the science. And as such, we've stopped believing our own eyes. But all that should be necessary is to walk out in the street or go into the mall and look around you and see the complete and total failure of our health care system in most of our countries. People are ugly. They're fat. They look weird. They can't walk. They're in wheelchairs. The kids are ugly. They look unattractive. And it's not just kind of the normal unattractiveness of awkward growth spurts and everything. You've got sunken in chins and weird deformations, etc. And we don't look like a healthy and attractive culture. And we have to change that. And it has to start with nutrition. And so if you're going to help your children to flourish and succeed, you have to invest into their nutrition from the earliest of age. And that means investing into mom and dad's nutrition. And you need to do that, if at all possible, prior to conception. Regardless of where you are in your family growth journey, we should be investing heavily into our nutrition. And this is a very good and very important way for us to be spending money. Money should be spent on acquiring the highest quality nutritional, the highest quality nutrition choices that we can have. Because we owe it to ourselves for our longevity and for our enjoyment of good health. We owe it to our children, to our grandchildren, our great-grandchildren. We should be systematically building cultures where we're looking forward five or six generations and asking ourselves, "What do my great-great-great-great-grandchildren need to flourish and succeed in the world?" Part of what they need is good genetics. There are other things as well, right? Maybe a trust, a dynasty trust set aside with 360 years worth of buildup that can support future generations. Fine, that's a good part. But at the end of the day, if you can build genetic material that is going to have your children be strong and healthy and long-lived, that's going to pay off massively. Now, I'm guilty of underappreciating this in years past. As I'm getting older, I think more about longevity. And one of the things that's been so remarkable to me is talking to people who don't expect to live long lives. Because I never grew up with that myself. I never grew up with that expectation. I always grew up expecting that I was going to live a long life. Most of my ancestors on both sides of my family have lived well into their 90s, in some cases, several past 100. And then even on my wife's side, amazingly, many of her ancestors are long-lived as well. She had one grandfather who died of lung cancer when he was in his 70s as a lifelong smoker. But all of the rest of her family members, she had one grandmother that died in early 90s, another in... I had to ask her. I think it was close to 90, late 80s. And then a grandfather lived 104 or 105. I can't remember. And so, this is interesting. And it's something that I myself never appreciated. But that's a legacy, a legacy of longevity and good health that was passed down to her through her side of the family and to me through our side of the family that we did nothing for. We did nothing to deserve. But what we do have is a responsibility of stewardship. We have a responsibility to steward that legacy for ourselves and to steward that legacy for our own coming generations. And as you'll hear me talk about when I talk about education and academic development, one of the ways that I'm seeking to do this is with educating my own children. So, I have my entire family listening to the audio book of this deep nutrition book because I want my children from the very earliest of ages to be thinking about their genetic wealth that is built up. And what's so fascinating to me as a financial planner is you can turn all of the numbers of finance on their head when you can insert more time. One of the things that I, in my career in income planning course, when I created that course, one of the things I spent a lot of time on is talking about how fundamentally you can transform your entire financial empire if you can rejigger all of the expectations of your expectations around your career and your retirement. And one of the great tragedies of modern, of many modern perspectives, many people's modern goals, is their goal in many cases is to work for the shortest possible period of time so that they can retire for the maximum period of time. And in many cases, people have not received a strong genetic heritage of longevity. And in many cases, people are expecting to die in their 60s, 70s, etc. And when you do that, it compresses all of the financial opportunity that your family has. The numbers that I run are to say, what if you worked until you were earning income? What if you worked earning income from the time that you're 20 to the time that you're 90? And what if you diligently save and invest during that time? And what if you have children when you're 20 or 25? And what if you have even, let's just use normal numbers, okay? Imagine that you have five children, one at say 22, one at 25, one at 28, one at 31, what am I up to, four, right? The one at 35, etc. Imagine that you just have five children. But then what if you build a family culture where each of your children has five children? All of a sudden, the single generation, the family tree can blossom massively. And what if you build a culture in which there is a tradition and a culture of good health, good nutrition? And so most of you, you and your spouse and most of your children, you start to build this culture where you're generally around until you're 90, 100, 120 years old, depending on what happens with longevity science and anti-aging stuff, which is a really interesting area of research right now. Well, now you can see and enjoy three and four generations of family culture. And what if you build a financial system where you systematically support your younger generations? And what if you grow that over time? And instead of older generations consuming all the wealth, it just keeps piling up and growing and growing. They'll be passing laws against your grandchildren like they do against the Rothschilds or someone. It's just an incredible vision when you flip everything on its head. And to me, it's very, very inspiring and encouraging. What if you build a family philosophy that is so robust and so strong? What if you live a faith that is so real and so powerful that all of your great-grandchildren want to be just like you? What if you write a book that encapsulates your wisdom, the things that you have learned, and your great-grandchildren study that book as part of their education? And what if you build that over time and you build a family culture? It's possible. People have done it throughout history. People with vision and a long-time perspective have done it. But we, in our modern age, have often abandoned this on every level. We've abandoned it from a health perspective, and we've expected a pill to solve anything. And we've swallowed the idea that we go, "Well, I just can't do anything about it." We've abandoned the concept of working for future generations in favor of saying, "Well, they've got to figure it out themselves. They've got to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps and, you know, we'll just do that." And these things are not healthy, right? We need to do better. And then back to kind of the working lifetime, we've abandoned largely the idea that our work is a fundamental, core, important part of what it means to be a human being, doing important contributions to the world. And we've assumed that the only reason to work is to earn money so that we can quit and retire. One of my favorite heroes is Dr. Denmark, who was, I think, the first female doctor to pass through, was the American Medical Association, something like that. She was a pediatrician in the state of Georgia, and she worked in active practice as a pediatrician until the age of 104, and then she retired for 10 years and died at 114. Well, if you could have the health and the kind of job that allows you to do that, just imagine what it can do to your finances. It's an incredible idea. So, this concept of investing into genetic wealth is really, really important. And one of the areas that we should be improving our, increasing our expenditures in our budgets is on food. We shouldn't have a goal of saying, "Well, what can I get on coupons that's cheap?" You know, I like couponing. I think it's cool. I really love Amy Decision's, you know, the Tightwad Gazette. But one of my great frustrations is a lot of the cheap food that you can get great coupons on is not good food. And so, food is something that we should be intentional about increasing our budget, and we should be finding and sourcing the highest quality foods and preparing them in the very best ways, and making sure that we ourselves and our children receive the highest possible nutrition, because these are the building blocks, and we need to invest into these things over the course of years, years and years. This is important for men and women, both, because for men, your nutrition affects your ability to procreate, whether you have viable sperm or not, and then the health of your sperm make a huge difference in the long-term health of the baby. One of the comments that, let me double-check her name, again, I think it's Shanahan, one of the comments that she made, yeah, Catherine Shanahan, one of the comments that she made in the book is about infertility. I have been shocked as, due to the significantly high levels of infertility that I see presented by my age group and my peer group, and some of these things are explainable and some of them are not, but it is shocking how many of my peers who over the last 10 years should be and should have been in their prime reproduction age, and I'm thinking healthy-looking people, right, people who seem like young, vigorous, healthy adults who have tremendous problems conceiving children and then bringing children to term, to healthy childbirth, and so it's a big and important thing. One more, I want to read one sidebar to you from this book, and I want to urge you that if this is something that you want to think more about, pick up Deep Nutrition or pick up any other book that you think will help you make a study of this and add anything to your own studies in this area, but I want to read this sidebar to you, and I want to point out to you how these things can make a difference in terms of investing in children. Six ways nutrition can optimize your child's growth. Number one, height. Pour more milk. A meta-analysis concluded that for each additional 100 milliliters of milk, roughly 3.3 ounces consumed daily, children grew an extra 0.2 centimeters, roughly 1/8 inch per year. Children in the study were aged 2 to 20, and the study duration ranged from a few months to two years. The study's authors noted that the growth effect was especially powerful in teens. It is not known if higher and sustained milk supplementation would have additive effects, but if avid milk drinker and NBA player Jeremy Lin is any example, at 6'3" with 5'6" parents, then perhaps it may. Height is something that is strongly correlated, especially in men. Height is something that is strongly correlated to lifetime success. I myself am 6 1/2 feet tall. I haven't measured it. I probably, I don't know if I'm stronger than that, but somewhere between 6'5" and 6'6". When I was younger, it was 6'5" and 3/4" when I stretched up, so let's just call it 6'5". During my entire lifetime, being tall has given me immeasurable advantages. It automatically commands more respect because you have a more imposing presence. People look up to you in the figurative sense, meaning they just automatically assume you to be more capable. Big tall men. I have a good friend of mine who is very short, a couple of them. We were talking about it recently, and what's amazing is that he's several years my senior, has all kinds of qualifications, but because of his short physical stature, people underestimate him constantly and continually. You look at income stats, etc. Tall men have earned higher incomes. Tall men have a much easier time attracting beautiful spouses. It just makes a big difference. If there's something that you can do to help your children to grow in height, then it's dramatic. Ms. Shanahan includes information in here in the book, an interesting analysis where you can see as nutrition in a population increases and gains and becomes better, then the height of a population increases. So height is important. Vision. Look for lots of variety. In a study of children between ages 7 and 10, children who developed nearsightedness compared to children who did not consumed significant less of a wide variety of nutrients. Protein, fat, cholesterol, vitamin B1, vitamin B2, vitamin C, phosphorus, and iron. Of note, although the myopic children ate roughly 300 fewer calories, there was no difference between the two groups in several anatomic metrics, height, weight, or head circumference. This suggests that while normal height, weight, and head circumference are indications of sufficient nutritional intake, they are not definitive indicators of optimal nutrition. It also suggests that children with normal vision may have been more physically active. I've always been nearsighted and I had LASIK vision correction surgery a couple years ago and it was a transformative event in my life. To finally experience what people with excellent vision experience, a life free of corrective lenses, has improved my quality of life immeasurably. It's one of the best things that has happened to me over the last decade. And if we can give good nutrition as well as good eyesight exercises, and et cetera, we may have a good eyesight exercise, good sunlight, good exercise, et cetera, just overall producing healthier children, we may help those children to have a higher chance of maintaining appropriately normal vision. Cognitive development, skip starchy snacks, nutrients shown to correlate most strongly with high IQ include vitamin E, omega-3, and iodine. Studies have shown that the higher a child's vitamin E, the better their language and social skills. Similarly, the higher a newborn's omega-3, as measured in maternal umbilical cord blood, the higher that child's IQ later in childhood. Additionally, cognition has been shown to be impaired by a snacky pattern of eating high carb foods, characterized by foods that require minimum preparation such as potatoes and other starchy roots, salty snacks, sugar preserves, and confectionery. Presumably this effect is mediated through reduced nutrition to calorie ratio. Again, IQ and cognitive ability is a major driver in long-term success of your children. And so from utero, you want to do everything possible to support the development of the smartest and most functional brain that your children are capable of, and then you want to support that, including supporting it with good nutrition. Lifespan, beget big babies, larger children born to non-diabetic moms have greater muscle mass, higher resistance to diabetes and obesity, and longer telomeres, the part of the DNA that determines how many more divisions a cell can undergo, thus influencing cellular lifespan, all known to be associated with longer life expectancy. How to grow a big baby without developing gestational diabetes? Aside from being tall and well-fed during your own childhood, we don't know much about specific interventions to produce bigger babies, but we do know something about how to avoid having a too small baby. Don't smoke, don't conceive while you're undernourished or underweight, and don't restrict protein, i.e. if you're vegan, you may need to supplement. Immune system, maximize microbes and micronutrients. Researchers at UC Davis found that individuals with subtle deficiencies of various micronutrients are more prone to develop a variety of common day-to-day infections, and are more likely to have more severe infections with prolonged convalescence. Allergies, asthma, and autoimmune illnesses are more prevalent in children with reduced microbial gut flora diversity. Experts recommend breastfeeding to optimize early gut flora development, and are considering recommending soil-based probiotics, including fermented foods in a child's diet, and encouraging outdoor play would be my preferred methods of introducing immune-boosting probiotics. Back to the immune system. Anything we can do to cultivate large and strong immune systems will have a strong knock-on effect to our children's lifetime success. A child who is sickly and misses, say, 10% of his school days will have a much harder time achieving academic success than the child who is healthy and is always present in school. These small percentages expanded out over time make a huge difference in long-term success. I mentioned on the previous episode that when I'm sick, I'm just filled with empathy for people who don't enjoy robust health, and I realize how much of my own success in life has simply come from the simple fact that I did nothing to deserve of being healthy. Because when you're healthy and you feel good, you're filled with energy, you can work hard, you can work consistently, and that work pays off in terms of financial productivity, career productivity, etc. Somebody who has a weakened immune system, and even just excluding chronic conditions, just experiences, gets more colds, more flus, common ordinary sicknesses, and those sicknesses, instead of being beat in six hours or a day, they linger on for two or three days, that person's, at the end of the year and at the end of the decade, that person's personal productivity will be dramatically reduced due to something as simple as having a weak immune system. Puberty. Avoid insulin resistance. Junk food consumption and being overweight are both associated with insulin resistance. Insulin resistance impacts boys and girls in different ways. For girls, it causes precocious puberty, so common today that we find breast development, typical of 11-year-olds a generation ago, often occurring in 7-year-olds, and rarely in 3-year-olds. Aside from its detrimental psychological effects, precocious puberty typically reduces the child's adult height. In boys, insulin resistance reduces testosterone levels. Low testosterone during puberty is associated with decreased development of muscle mass, impaired growth of the penis and testicles, reduced deepening of the voice, development of breast tissue, and lack of normal male hair growth. In conclusion for this particular commentary, do everything you possibly can to emphasize the health of a mother and a father and build strongly the health of the mother and father prior to conception so that at the moment of conception, you have the very healthiest, most vibrant sperm that could possibly exist, and you have the very healthiest, most beautiful egg that could possibly exist. And when those come together and in that magical moment form your new baby, you want all of the genetic material that is present to be completely functional and give you the highest probability of having a beautiful, healthy child. Then throughout pregnancy, support the mother's physical health as strongly as your budget can possibly make possible. Buy the very highest quality foods in abundance. Support her with the greatest diversity of nutrients, making sure that her diet is of the best quality that exists. Don't cheap out on good food just to save a buck. Think of your family's genetic heritage 50, 100, 200 years from now and invest into it today the way that you wish your forebears had invested into it for you. You may not come from a family of strong genetic wealth. Your parents may have all, or your grandparents may have all expired at the age of 60. That stinks. But you can start today to give the kind of gift to your great-grandchildren that you wish they could have. So in conclusion to this long section, nutrition makes a huge impact on long-term growth potential of your child. Now for a limited time at Del Amo Motorsports.

Now, in addition to nutrition, you want to do everything you can to support a mother's health during the gestation of your baby. That includes exercise and psychology. One of the most important things for a mother to do during gestation while the baby is in her womb is to exercise consistently but not over much. Meaning a strong mother will have a better pregnancy, will be healthier, contribute to the health of the baby, and will have a better childbirth and a better recovery after childbirth. And so you want a mother to be exercising consistently and to be strong. And then psychologically, one of the best investments you can make is helping an expectant mother to be in the healthiest possible state. As a man, once you've made your contribution to the family genetic pool, it's done. Your physical health is not, your physical actions are not going to impact the baby at that point on genetically, whereas a mother's body will. But what you can do is you can care for the mother in a strong way and make sure that all of her emotional state is as positive as it possibly can be with the goal of having a healthy and natural childbirth. It's hard to know, just like with genetic factors regarding health, it's always hard to know how much credit a person can take for the relative good health that you may enjoy. You ask yourself, "Well, am I enjoying good health because of all my hard work and my good diet and my good exercise, etc., or am I enjoying good health because I won the genetic lottery?" On the other hand, "Am I sick because of my own choices or am I sick because of the choices of my forebears?" How do you know? Same thing with natural childbirth. If you're trying to help a mother prepare for natural, for effective and healthy and smooth and easy and pain-free childbirth, and she experiences that, it's hard to know how much credit to take. I know plenty of people who worked hard to prepare for childbirth and weren't able to do it. So I'm giving a disclaimer here that I'm going to tell you some of the things that I have done and that my wife and I have worked at to try to have healthy, easy childbirths, and thank God we've experienced those. But I also acknowledge the fact that I don't know how much of that is due to any particular single factor that we have done. But I'll tell you what we do. First, I think that you should have a goal of having the very best childbirth that you want, that you can have. And if you're looking for the well-being of the child, I think the best outcome for the child is to have a natural vaginal childbirth, if at all possible. It's the best for the mother and it's the best for the child. Now, in the United States, at least among my peers who are culturally similar, there is a strong... This is kind of acknowledged, like of course that's what the desire would be. Globally though, you'll find regions of the world in which this is not even discussed. There are some regions of the world in which their rate of natural childbirth is incredibly low. All of us should be extremely grateful for the technology of cesarean childbirth. It's an incredible technology that has saved so many mothers and babies' lives and we should be grateful for it. It is inferior... Cesarean birth is superior to the death of a mother or the death of a baby, but it is inferior to natural childbirth if the goal is the best start for the baby. Without going past my area of expertise, there are all kinds of functions of the actual birth process for a baby that if a baby will experience natural, non-drug-affected vaginal childbirth, he will be set up for his best possible chance at life. The action of the womb during labor, the chemicals and the... I wish I knew all the proper terms. I've read cursory about it enough to know that it's there, but without going deeply into it. But all of the chemicals and the bacteria and the things that the baby is exposed to as he passes along the vaginal birth path, all of these things are really good. And when a baby is born at full term through natural childbirth, the baby is strong and ready to go. And his first days can be incredibly healthy and he can very quickly go about his entrance into the world. I've seen this happen five times and I've always been just so blessed to see a healthy, happy baby come into the world. And I myself have received all five of my children. It's something that happened unintentionally the first time and since then I loved it so much. It was just a wonderful aspect. And I always tell fathers, like one of the coolest things you can do is you be the one to receive your own babies. It's an amazing thing. And so when you hold a newborn in your hands that is literally one second old and you can interact with and you see him happy and healthy and alert and ready to go, and then you start that process, a bonding process with a mother and she's not drugged up, the baby's not drugged up, she's alert, she's rested, she's healthy, et cetera. It starts everything going well. And so if at all possible, work for and plan for natural childbirth. The things that we try to do is really good nutrition, really good exercise, chiropractic care to me makes a big difference. Chiropractic care, regular chiropractic care of a mother in preparation for childbirth to ensure that her pelvis and her skeletal system is in the best alignment possible. And then dealing with the psychological challenges that can sometimes impair childbirth, making sure that a mother feels strong and confident about her ability to deliver a child, making sure that she's completely free of fear related to childbirth, that she's filled with positive expectation around childbirth, and then using good techniques to minimize pain and discomfort during childbirth. All of these are good and productive things to work at. And I'm not going to go deep because I think those are well attended to in most of the cultures that I'm exposed to. Now, in the very afterbirth, however the birth goes, the most important thing that you can do to invest into your child is to invest into the relationship of your baby and the mother. In general, this means having lots and lots of time together. If you want your child to succeed, the best investment you can make into your baby is making sure that he and his mother have a strong relationship. And this begins from the very beginning. Physically, his most important nutrition is going to come from breastfeeding. The data on breastfeeding is unequivocal. And again, just like the comment on C-sections, we should be grateful for the many babies' lives who have been saved with high quality nutritious formula. We should also acknowledge, and we should acknowledge that formula is better than death. But formula is nowhere near as good for a baby as his mother's breast milk. The problem is breastfeeding is hard. It is hard and it is incredibly demanding on a mother. It's hard and demanding in a way that I think, at least in my experience, is probably more than birth. When my wife and I had our first baby, we worked so hard to be prepared for the childbirth and we were so blindsided by how difficult breastfeeding was that it was just, it was way more difficult than childbirth. Breastfeeding is difficult physically for the mother. It hurts. It hurts in different ways at different stages. But those first few days are often extremely painful. And it's incredibly demanding because of the scheduling demands that the baby places on the mother. Babies don't sleep very long because they're usually hungry. I forget what the formula is. People say, okay, the baby can sleep for as many hours as he is months old or something like that. But the point is a new baby will often need to eat every two, three, four hours depending on the child and depending on the age. This eating process, especially for a little baby, is often a 30 to 60 to 90 minute process depending on the child and depending on what's necessary for the burping and all of the stuff, etc. And so a new mother is going to wind up being awakened on a 24 hour basis every few hours. And that's very, very disruptive for her. It's very, very hard. And so if you're going to support that process, the most important thing you can do is eliminate all of her stress, eliminate all of her difficulty, and eliminate all of her outside obligations. So what I try to do is make sure that the only job she has is to take care of baby. And obviously I'm going to do my best to help take care of baby, especially in those early days. For the uninitiated fathers, one of the things that's very important to understand is that childbirth, even the most medically textbook perfect childbirth, quote unquote, is a traumatic physical event. When the placenta of the baby detaches from the uterine wall, it leaves a significant scar, a significant wound that needs time to heal. And so a new mother needs time in bed, she needs time just to recover, she needs time just to rest and heal. And that process, she shouldn't carry the baby in the first few days, she shouldn't be doing anything difficult, she should just be resting and recovering from childbirth. And breastfeeding itself is such a demand on a mother's body that she needs lots of time to rest. So you can't really spend money on this process. What you can do is you can spend time, and you can try to eliminate her stress. And so at least the way that we've tried to do it is right now my wife does nothing. I do everything that can possibly be done, which is why I'm talking about this with you. And I haven't done many podcasts because I'm making all the food, I'm taking care of all the children, I'm doing all the homeschooling, and she's in bed with the baby. That's her job. And I do what I can to help with the baby, but obviously it's just, it's a mother's job in the first few months. Now, if you want to invest in the long-term outcome for your new baby, then you'll do everything you can to extend the duration of that relationship and contact between the mother. A baby who experiences the continual comforting presence of his mother will have most likely a strong psychological standpoint in life. If you go and look at some of the studies that have been done for babies in orphanages, and you look at everything from touch, right, how much a baby is touched, spoken to, etc., then what you see is that the most important thing for a baby is relationship. Lots and lots of cuddling, right? There's studies on skin-on-skin contact, making sure the baby has lots of contact with a mother or father's body, skin-on-skin. Making sure that there's lots of conversation, lots of reassurance. You can build a strong psychology into your baby, or let me rephrase. Hold on, that was probably too strong of a statement. You can put in place the best possibility of a strong psychology, emotional regulation in your baby at an early age if the baby will know nothing but continual love and continual connection. So the physical aspect is provided by the nutrition from his mother. So we support the mother's body with the best nutrition that we can. The mother's body creates the highest quality breast milk for the baby. That breast milk, with ideally copious amounts and for extended periods of time, is going to provide for the best possible growth potential of the baby. But that's demanding on the mother. So the way that we invest into that is by freeing the mother from obligations. Imagine yourself, this is why I hate it when women feel like they have to go back to work three months after the baby is born. Imagine yourself as a breastfeeding mother, sitting at work with a thing on your breasts, you know, and trying to find a quiet corner where you can put a thing on your breasts so you can pump milk for your baby, so that some, you know, hired worker can give that milk to your baby. There are so many dedicated mothers who do this, and it sucks for them. And so as a husband, as a father, one of your, I say mandatory, but you do it, is to never put your wife in that situation. If she has a job or a career that she wants to pursue, and your children are older, and they're not breastfeeding, and you've got a great school for them, and they're older, etc., fine. But don't ever put that kind of demand on your wife that somehow she's going to go to work with a pump attached to her breasts and try to figure out how to make money while she's doing that. If that's something that she does, you guys work out fine, but don't ever make it because of money. Invest in such a way so that she can be there with the baby, and so that she can be there constantly with the baby, and so that she can get plenty of sleep, and so that she can get all of the things that she needs. One of the reasons I've set up my life the way that I have is to be able to support my wife. My wife is not sleep deprived. Her sleep schedule is messed up because she's being awakened during the night, of course, but she's not sleep deprived. I make sure she gets plenty of sleep because I've arranged my life in such a way that I can support her in that so that she's not sleep deprived. And these, to me, are really useful points of wealth. It's a good way to spend money, and it pays off in terms of the long-term benefit for your children. So if you want to invest in your babies, what do they need? They need love. They need physical touch. They need conversation. They need nutrition. They need sleep. And the best person who's able to provide those things is their mother. The most dedicated professional in the world. You go out and you find the best trained nanny for your 22-month-old baby is never going to have the strongest, the kind of care that the baby's mother can have. And so support her in that. Now there are women who are not inclined in the direction of mothering. Increasingly, I think many of those women today have chosen not to bear children. Historically in the past, there were a lot of mothers who bore children, and they just weren't great mothers. And so that was why I made the comments I made about if you want to have healthy children, you're going to need to choose a healthy mother. A mother who's willing and is going to love her children. And do the best with what you've got, whatever it is that you have, as fathers and husbands. But support her in that, and make her job easy. And the more that her psychology is strong, the better she feels, the more loved and cared for she is, the happier the baby is likely to be. And investing into those initial months and years of a baby's life, it all comes down to presence. There's nothing academic that you can do, there's nothing, anything that's going to matter. It comes down to presence and being together. I'm going to save some of the positive things that you can do physically and whatnot for young children for the next episode in this series. I'll just on this, just include here, the importance of eliminating and removing all trauma and potential trauma from a baby's life. If you look at the development of children who've been raised in difficult circumstances, right, you can go and you can find children who, fetal alcohol syndrome, their mother drank a lot, or drugs and whatnot, and you can see the physical problems those children face. You can go and you can look at some of the studies that have been done on children raised in orphanages, and over the years there's just been some horrific, horrifically immoral studies done, you know, about children that didn't experience touch, and children that weren't talked to and whatnot. And they're just, they're wrecked for life. But one of the things that is clear and consistently true is you have to make sure that you eliminate trauma, or potential trauma, in a child's life. And, you know, serious trauma when children are physically abused or sexually abused, it literally stunts their growth and their development on, in some cases, a physical level, but especially on an emotional and cognitive level. There are 50-year-old men out there walking around in, with the brain of a six-year-old because they experienced some significant trauma when they were six years old. And so you have a duty and a responsibility to your children to construct around them a very, very safe cocoon, and to make sure that they are in that safe cocoon until they are ready to leave it. There is a huge difference between telling your, working with your 14-year-old to help your 14-year-old face the challenges of the modern age and of "real life" versus forcing your 14-year-old to go to the church nursery when he's sitting there crying for you. There's a huge difference between dealing with adolescents and older children who are capable of rational thought, etc., and having separation, etc., from their parents versus dealing with young children and separating young children from their parents. And so in many, one of the things I have observed is that in our modern age, many parents seem to take pride in their children's ability to be detached from the parent. I don't think that's necessarily a thing to take pride in, right? A healthy child at an appropriate age should certainly be able to do well not being with a parent. That's fine. But you want your children to know nothing but complete safety during the entire lifetime until they're ready to bear adult responsibilities and recognize that the world is unsafe, but especially in those early years. So you must protect your children from trauma and potential trauma in all of its forms. Be a bear about it if necessary. If there are people in your life who are potential sources of fear, of trauma, etc. And by the way, this can range, we have a tendency I think to go to the most extreme, meaning we have a tendency to go to the most horrific expressions of abuse that we're aware happen in the world. But I think most of us don't face those dangers very much, right? Those dangers are actually quite low in the modern world. But there are a lot of traumas that come in that are much more mild. Scary stories, scary people, scary ideas, etc. These things are not healthy to impose into our children's lives. And so I guess my point is simply be a bear and create a very safe and warm and comfortable home environment that is protected, that is a shelter so that your children don't experience any form of trauma. In the next episode of this series we will pick up with childhood education. We'll talk about the things that you can do to support your children in their development physically, spiritually, mentally, and academically, and how you can do a lot of those things at a very early age. So I don't participate in Teach-A-Baby-To-Read like I once did, but I do think there's a lot you can do at a very early age. And we'll pick up with some of those things that on this foundation can supercharge the results of success in the modern world. And I'll share with you how those things can, again, keep your child on a success path. By way of review I want to emphasize, because sometimes because I've talked so much about so many things you may have lost the thread. By way of review I want to emphasize what we've talked about. Number one, the basic genetics of a child's parents are going to drive the child's long-term success. So you want to be very careful about who you are engaging to be the genetic donor of your child. In addition, that person who is supporting the mother is going to have an inordinate influence on the kind of babyhood that that child receives. So as a prospective mother, choosing to marry somebody who wants children and wants you to be a mother is going to be very different than choosing to marry somebody who expects you to earn two-thirds of the family income and get back to work really quickly. Choosing to marry somebody who earns enough money to allow you to comfortably be a stay-at-home mother is going to put your life on a very different scale than marrying somebody who doesn't earn enough money to allow you to comfortably be a stay-at-home mother. So you want to be very careful. Choosing to marry somebody who is of high character and is going to treat you well and willing to spend the money on your nutrition, etc., those things matter. So you want to think about it prior to the relationship. Then prior to conception of the baby, you want to do everything possible on a physical basis to support the nutrition of the mother and father so that the baby has the very best genetic material already woven into his body at the moment of conception. Then while the baby is in utero, you want to do everything you can to support his healthy growth and working towards supporting the health and the mental strength of the mother so that she can be looking forward to a healthy and safe natural childbirth. And then after childbirth, you want to support the baby with the best nutrition coming through his mother's breast milk and the best environment for him to grow, which primarily means sleeping and eating, in a completely safe environment. And you want to keep mama feeling really strong mentally with lots of rest, lots of support, and you want to keep her really strong physically. Then as your baby starts to reach several months old and starts to be interacting, that's where we'll pick it up in the next episode.
