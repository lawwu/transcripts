Paul's example in his past life and present ministry with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ's blessing is really quite astonishing because of the actual use he himself makes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of that example. Paul was complicit in Stephen's murder in Acts 7. Then as he became a ringleader</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in the efforts to stamp out Christianity with imprisonments and murders, it got even worse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and more intentional. Acts 9, verse 1, "Saul, still breathing threats and murder against</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the disciples of the Lord, went to Damascus." In short, Paul was a murderer, and murderers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">don't have eternal life in them, John said. Paul's own assessment of his pre-Christian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">life was that he was the worst, the foremost of sinners, and that God saved him and used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.060</a></span> | <span class="t">him anyway precisely as an example to others who feel hopeless about their future possibilities</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.700</a></span> | <span class="t">of forgiveness and usefulness is a precious reality in Scripture. Here's the way he says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">it in 1 Timothy 1, 15 and 16, "The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.740</a></span> | <span class="t">that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am the foremost, but I received</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.460</a></span> | <span class="t">mercy for this reason." And this is why it's so remarkable because he himself—we don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">have to make this application—he's making the application. "I received mercy for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.540</a></span> | <span class="t">reason that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life." So Paul gives his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.460</a></span> | <span class="t">own experience of mercy as an example that I think extends to a person who may not have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.260</a></span> | <span class="t">murdered but has in fact committed fornication. That's my first argument.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Second, it's a little more complicated because the young fellow that we're dealing with here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">he's sharp. He has studied and he's thought through the possible blockages to his own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.860</a></span> | <span class="t">eldership. He's asking a more sophisticated question. He says, he asks, on the basis of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">1 Corinthians 6, 16, whether in fact fornication is a unique kind of sin that may exclude from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">ministry when in fact murder may not. Now that's a thoughtful question because of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">way Paul argues against fornication in 1 Corinthians 6. And because 1 Timothy 3, 2, which he refers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">to, in that text Paul says that a minister in the church must be the husband of one wife,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.460</a></span> | <span class="t">which some translate a one-woman man. That's a pretty common paraphrase, a one-woman man.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.620</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, our friend, this young fellow, wonders if he can qualify as a one-woman man</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">because he committed fornication. That's the way he's thinking, which is a good way to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">think. I mean, it's a good question to ask. It means he's not weaseling. He's not trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to squeak out of the rigors of Scripture. So let me try to clarify what I think Paul</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">means by husband of one woman. That's important in the way his argument against himself is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">working and why one-woman man may be a misleading translation. I got a lot of friends that translate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it that way, and I've got misgivings about that translation. Suppose your pastor is single.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I think that's legitimate. Jesus is single. Paul is single. I think it's legitimate to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">have a single man for a pastor. Suppose your pastor is single and he commits fornication</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">regularly with only one woman. Would he qualify as being a one-woman man? Well, good grief,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Piper. Technically, yes, and we all know that's not what Paul meant. So translating husband</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of one woman as one-woman man can get us into difficulty if we're not careful. Paul really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is dealing with marriage and whether a man is faithful to his wife, whether he commits</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">adultery. Now, the question then becomes, what do we make of Paul's argument against</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">fornication in 1 Corinthians 6? Because some might say, well, Paul really does argue that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.340</a></span> | <span class="t">in essence a sexual relationship before marriage is a kind of marriage. And then our young</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">friend might draw the conclusion, well, so I was in a sense married, and I'm not faithful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to that girl today by not being married to her officially, not to mention that I can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">even get married legitimately if I'm still married to her because that old relationship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that what Paul meant? He says in 1 Corinthians 6:14-18, "The body is not meant for sexual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">immorality," that is fornication, "but for the Lord and the Lord for the body. Do you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">not know that your bodies," and here he's getting very specific. He means our sexual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">organs.

And he cries out, "Never!" And then here's the tricky part.

And he quotes Genesis 2:24, which is about marriage. "For as it is written,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the two shall become one flesh.

So Paul</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">portrays the horror of fornication for the Christian as taking the body parts of Christ,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">because ours are his, and making them body parts of a prostitute. That's how intimate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and profound sexual intercourse is in Paul's apostolic-inspired mind.

What makes the text look ominous for our young friend is that Paul quotes Genesis</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">2:24, which is a text about marriage. "The two shall become one flesh." So does Paul</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">mean that in essence then the one who fornicates with a prostitute is married to her? That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.020</a></span> | <span class="t">what he wonders, so that he would be excluded because of 1 Timothy 3.2. And my answer is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">no.

He doesn't draw that inference</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">or that conclusion.

So what's he doing? I think what he's doing is this. He says, "What</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.380</a></span> | <span class="t">makes fornication so horrible is that it takes the one flesh design of marriage and prostitutes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.860</a></span> | <span class="t">it." He prostitutes that part of marriage by stripping it out of the covenant relationship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">of marriage and treating it as though it was designed for a prostitute. It's precisely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">that this is not a marriage that makes the prostitution of Christ's body parts so horrible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">The one flesh union designed for marriage, which represents Christ in the church, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GasWcIZgLzE&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.460</a></span> | <span class="t">is why it's not idolatry to have sex in marriage.
