And I say this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because of 1 Peter 2.12, "Keep your conduct among the Gentiles, honorable," Gentiles means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">unbelievers, "honorable, so that when they speak against you as evil doers, they may see your good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation." Good deeds, Lawson, of course, can never replace</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">words that explain the gospel and why you love Christ. In fact, just three verses earlier,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">verse nine of 1 Peter 2, he said, "Proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">darkness into his marvelous light." But practical good deeds have an important role to play,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and they can put to silence the criticism that Christianity just means not doing certain things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">My dad used to love to quote one of his teachers, he'd say to me, "Do so fast you don't have time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to don't." Because we were pretty serious Christians growing up, and there are a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">things we didn't do because we were Christians.

That's what I'm suggesting in number two. Number three, be on the lookout for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">lowly people, lonely people, hurting people, and step into their lives with interest and care and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">time that other people don't care about giving. Romans 12, 16, "Live in harmony with one another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly. Never be wise in your own sight." What an unusual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">teenager you will be if you do that. Number four, meet with the Lord alone early every morning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and get a good word from Scripture that you will keep in your mind as something precious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and valuable and encouraging all day long. In other words, don't just have devotions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and come away with nothing stuck in your mind, but look for some single phrase or statement or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">promise or command that helps you and keep it in your mind. You might jot it on a little piece of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">paper and stick it in your shirt pocket. That's what I used to do. This will serve you all day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">long for encouragement, and it'll be there if somebody gets into a conversation with you and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">asks you, "What does it mean for you to be a Christian?" You can smile and say, "You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">just this morning, I was talking to God, and He was talking to me." Now, He doesn't talk with a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">voice. He talks in the Bible. "He was talking to me, and this is what He said." Then you quote your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">verse or you get out your little piece of paper, and you read them and say, "That's encouraging me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">all day long. That's what it means for me to walk with God." Jesus said, "Man shall not live by bread</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God." So take a word, take a phrase,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and go with it all day long for encouragement and readiness. Fifth, plan activities with your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">friends that you can invite unbelievers to be a part of. In other words, don't wait for the crisis</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">where they invite you to go to something that you're not sure you can go to. Then you have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">say no, and you might simply look like somebody who doesn't like people or doesn't have any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeJy_0d4l0&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">friends.
