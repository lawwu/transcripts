Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast for Monday, August 18, 2014.</p><p>I thank you for being here. Mobile podcasting today. I am on the road, but I wasn't going to leave you without a show. I wouldn't do that to you. What would you do without your daily dose of Radical Personal Finance Podcast? I couldn't leave you without a daily dose.</p><p>I know, I know. Maybe you're not quite that addicted that you could go one day without a show, but I'm doing my best to bring you a show every day. And I just want to give you something thought provoking. Today's show is going to be very different than any show we have ever done, and it will be shorter than any show we have ever done.</p><p>I am currently sitting here on the shores of Lake Austin in Austin, Texas. I've been this weekend at the Podcast Movement Conference in Dallas and then came up to, or down to Austin to visit a friend of mine. And I'll be back with you soon with full length shows.</p><p>But today I am going to share with you a thought provoking poem. I've had a wonderful weekend. I will do, I'll give you some information and some of the things that I learned attending this conference. I've had an awesome time and it was really a great experience for me.</p><p>But I don't have time today to record that. So I'm going to leave you today with one of my favorite poems. This is a poem entitled, "It Couldn't Be Done." And the author is Edgar Albert Guest. I won't give you any commentary or interpret it for you. I will leave that up to you.</p><p>Somebody said that it couldn't be done, but he with a chuckle replied that maybe it couldn't, but he would be one who wouldn't say so till he tried. So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin on his face. If he worried, he hid it. He started to sing as he tackled the thing that couldn't be done.</p><p>And he did it. Somebody scoffed, "Oh, you'll never do that. At least no one has done it." But he took off his coat and he took off his hat. And the first thing we knew he'd begun it. With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin without any doubting or quit it, he started to sing as he tackled the thing that couldn't be done.</p><p>And he did it. There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done. There are thousands to prophesy failure. There are thousands to point out to you one by one the dangers that wait to assail you. But just buckle it in with a bit of a grin. Just take off your coat and go to it.</p><p>Just start to sing as you tackle the thing that couldn't be done. And you'll do it. Enjoy your Monday, everybody. Hey parents, join the LA Kings on Saturday, November 25th for an unforgettable kids day presented by Pear Deck. Family fun, giveaways and exciting Kings hockey awaits.
