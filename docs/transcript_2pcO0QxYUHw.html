Do you tell people to create two different presentations? - Yes, 100%. Yeah, almost always, because at the end of the day, your slides, I mean, think about it.</p><p>You're giving a presentation with slides. What do you actually want them to do, the person? Do you want them to read the slide, the words on there, and read the information? Then what are you doing there? Like, they're reading it. And if you don't want them to read it, then why have it?</p><p>Like, unless it's just a picture, you're describing it, like, right, exactly. So there are your two things. You want them to read it or you don't. If you don't want them to read it, then it better be something that accentuates what you're saying. Bullet points, pictures, simple messages, like that simple.</p><p>If you put up something enough that they have to read, there's no point in having it there because if you're talking, they're not gonna, what are they, trying to split time on reading it? Doing, jumping ahead, it's just, it's a disaster. People wanna put slides so it looks like they've done a lot of work.</p><p>It's like, okay, by the way, I'm not even against that sometimes. Sometimes there's graphs and charts that look good. So you put it on a slide and when you're presenting in person, but you're not speaking to the numbers on there. You're saying, we did extensive research and I will send you this in detail so you can read what this slide says, but here's the summary, right?</p><p>As opposed to like, here's the market research response. As you could see here, it's like, your slides should accentuate what you're saying, not trying to do the work for you.</p></div></div></body></html>
