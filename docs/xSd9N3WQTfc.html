investing, so being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSd9N3WQTfc&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">clear on what your

target="_blank">00:02:45.340</a></span> | <span class="t">over various time horizons to inform how you would think about how to invest given your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSd9N3WQTfc&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">proximity to the goal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

10-year time horizon, stocks have actually been extraordinarily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSd9N3WQTfc&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">reliable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSd9N3WQTfc&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So in more than 90% of rolling 10-year periods, whenever the periods might be, you are most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSd9N3WQTfc&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">likely going to gain money over that 10-year time horizon.</span></div><div

it to like 5 years or 3 years or certainly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSd9N3WQTfc&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.880</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:03:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So the odds are well less than 90% if you have a 5-year time horizon for stocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSd9N3WQTfc&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.580</a></span> | <span class="t">fairly short time

years is a good guidepost when deciding whether you are going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSd9N3WQTfc&t=240"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSd9N3WQTfc&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So you'd want to think about having probably 25 years or 30 years overall that you'll have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSd9N3WQTfc&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">where you'll be spending your

good example of a shorter-duration goal, where if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSd9N3WQTfc&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.320</a></span>

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSd9N3WQTfc&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">That means that when that goal date arrives, you'd want to have the
