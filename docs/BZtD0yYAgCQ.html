not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we've all heard that enough times, at least I have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And Swix did a good job of humbling all designers with this tweet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">where he basically called all the design thought leaders out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">who were saying chat is dead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, or sorry, chat's not the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they show off their cool demo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then shortly after we'll just go back to using ChatGPT.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, fair point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that right now we're in this state of a bit of a dualistic future of AI UX.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I've called this first section Schrodinger's Chat because we all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, all designers know how many usability issues that the chatbots have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">but yet we all still use them every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's kind of like obviously they are the future, but at the same time obviously they shouldn't be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I won't go into my thoughts on if they should be, but I'll do some, some anthropology here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.220</a></span> | <span class="t">just getting everybody up to speed in case you're not familiar with the great chatbot debate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not sure if people realize how long we've been debating this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">but I can track it all the way back to 2022 with this post from Linus Lee,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">which, this is a great post by the way, still holds up today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">but he essentially says he doesn't think that exposing the raw text completion is really the right paradigm long term.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, note the date, May 2022, because a couple months after that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we have ChatGPT essentially saying, hold my beer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, if that's not the right UI paradigm, it certainly didn't bother them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think a lot of other designers have kind of taken note of the escape velocity of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But still, the next year, May 2023, we saw some other great posts from people like Emilia Wadenberger,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and then the next month, Maggie Appleton, who are making great arguments about why Chat's not the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.980</a></span> | <span class="t">These, I think, hold up pretty well, but at the same time, yeah, obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">you have other designers who are arguing how intuitive it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then as we progress and ChatGPT hits escape velocity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we're kind of seeing everybody just start to meme the defense of chat, which is like, just look at the chart, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, obviously, it's working, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think there's something interesting about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.740</a></span> | <span class="t">If you can kind of come to the debate with a meme, it means there's something a bit intuitive about your argument.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, fair enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But then still, even in March of this year, we've had people like Julian Lear writing very good reasons of why Chat should not be the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And he's, like, showing clock speed here relative to the different interface paradigms, so it's very convincing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">He pretty much says it's a bottleneck, but at the same time, you know, we'll all probably still go back to using Chat after this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'll segue into the next section here, which is called models and modes, and this is on this idea of the model picker,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">which is this other UI paradigm that's been developing alongside ChatBot's popularity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's that, you know, I'm sure everybody knows what it is, but to be clear, it's this dropdown where you just have to select from a million different models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I put this, I made this section in memory of Larry Tesler, if you're not familiar with him, he's kind of a big deal, invented, like, copy and paste and stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But another thing he was famous for was apparently saying, don't mode me in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't actually believe he would say this, but, I mean, the quote is, like, attributed to him, but, you know, he hated modes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you're not familiar with modes, this is a setting and a UI where once you flip it, all of a sudden your inputs are mapping to drastically different outputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so Larry Tesler hated this, he thought it was unintuitive and he wanted everything to be modeless.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't know how many, or, sorry, to give an example of a mode, just to be clear, caps lock, this is a mode, right, you hit caps lock and now your keyboard performs differently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And then a more recent mode, excuse me, I'm not sure how many people would agree with me on this, but I think that the model picker, sorry, this is my voice at, like, the worst time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that the model picker is a bit of a mode selector as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.100</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it's, obviously we're dealing with stochastic output and general value applications, so everything, it's kind of not a distinct change in setting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">but once you flip a different model, you have a whole step change of output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, to me, that's kind of like a mode selector, and here's a quick video to illustrate this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.100</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a bit old, it's the, an older version of ChatGPT, but you can see I'm trying to use certain modes and the model is not supporting it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have to go through this menu and find which model allows me to use this mode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the argument here is like we're kind of putting modes on top of modes, right, you now have to match models to modes and it's not super intuitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.100</a></span> | <span class="t">They've actually done a great job of redesigning this lately, so this is certainly not like throwing shade at OpenAI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they have a great design team, but I'm just kind of illustrate a moment in time when this was super frustrating to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And, like, you kind of just want to talk to the model and be like, here's my use case, like, what mode and what model should I use?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But I don't know, maybe, maybe the model will pick itself and so that won't work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is really illustrating the point of the, the flexibility usability trade-off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.100</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a design principle where pretty much you're constantly trying to decide, like, how well do you understand user needs?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you can pretty much pinpoint them down, then you can create a very, very usable optimized UX for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And, but as you try to make a more flexible system, the usability tends to, to decrease because you're just increasing the amount of edge cases and the complexity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And the requirements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that this is a trade-off that doesn't get talked enough about in this is chat the future debate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we generally talk about in terms of absolutes, but it's really less of a yes and a no, or, and more of like a timeframe and like what trade-offs are we talking about?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'd like to segue into this next section, which is going to push the idea of like when we design interfaces, we really need to consider the zeitgeist that we're working in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So what are the trade-offs of the time?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.100</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, what constraints we're working with?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">What timeframe could an interface be good for?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">The subtitle of this one is called the context of all in which we live and all that came before us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Easter egg for anybody who remembers that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so to get into this section, I'd like to lean into a theory from the innovative solution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the follow up to the innovators dilemma.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And in this book, they try to give you some guidelines on theory of how to approach building products with this idea of product architecture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So the architecture is generally this idea that you have a system and you're trying to figure out how the components in the system are interacting with each other or interfacing with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when you start to understand how they interact with each other, you can see different attributes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So they map them out to these two distinct sides of a spectrum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.100</a></span> | <span class="t">You've got integrated architectures and then you've got modular architectures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, generally integrated, this is more common in early stage disruption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And you have proprietary technologies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">They're very optimized, interdependent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It allows vertical scaling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And then to contrast that, you have modular.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is generally when technologies start to commoditize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And they can be more interdependent and you can allow horizontal scaling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But the key point in their theory is that you're never really on one side of the spectrum or the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.100</a></span> | <span class="t">You're instead kind of bouncing between the two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And the industry as well is having different parts of the tech stack commoditize and decommoditize all at once.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So as a designer or anybody else building, you pretty much have to figure out where are the strategic points to be integrated versus modular.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so their theory is like IBM is an example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.100</a></span> | <span class="t">When they started out making mainframe computers very integrated, then they shifted to personal computers and started to make it more modular.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, of course, ended up the whole computer itself ended up commoditizing at some point and they got out of that business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So thinking through today what parts of the AI industry are commoditizing and decommoditizing can help us think about how to design interfaces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, of course, the main question probably everybody would ask when you start to pose this prompt is, are the models themselves commoditizing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Because this is kind of like the big topic that everybody debates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And it brings us to the bitter lesson from Rich Sutton.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.100</a></span> | <span class="t">If you haven't read this, I definitely recommend doing so if it's not wise to build an AI today without knowing this lesson.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'll take the TLDR for this talk is that we shouldn't assume that computation is constant as long as we're seeing scaling laws in effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Like as long as the next model is still important, which you can see it still is like every time a new model comes out, everybody's like drop everything and let's check out the new model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">As long as the scaling laws are still in effect, then we can assume that the models themselves are not commoditized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, the bitter lesson actually leads us to what I'll call the bitter design lesson, why not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is this idea that if the basis of competition is inference performance, then the UI itself must be primarily focused on conforming to the next model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, said plainly, if the model's not commoditized, it's actually the interface that's the commodity now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And until that changes when models overshoot user needs and you don't need a rocket scientist doing whatever use case you're doing in ChatGPT, then we can start to explore different integrations within the interface.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But until then, the primary job of every interface really has to be figuring out how to conform to the next model's capabilities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's kind of a bitter design lesson because then you get layouts like this, which, you know, the bitter layout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Pretty uninspiring, not super usable, just not very cool at all, but the one thing this does really well is it can absorb the next model's capabilities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, as soon as that next model comes out, jam it into the bitter layout, and then, you know, update your model picker, and your app is more intelligent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, I hate this design, but, like, as a designer, like, you can't really hate on this ROI, which is you just add one line item, and now your app is NX more intelligent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, kind of hard to debate this as a design decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's the bitter design lesson.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And the takeaway from this, I think, is, you know, I'm not ready to eat my words on saying Chat is not the future yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think that it's quite clear that this one attribute of Chat, which is that it can really conform to the next model very easily, is one of the key features we need to keep in mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, the future of AI/UX until we see models stop commoditizing, or excuse me, until models do commoditize, will be that the future of AI/UX must conform to the next model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's the bitter design lesson, but how do we go from bitter to sweet?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Right, what comes next?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And, as most things in life, Brett Victor has already given a really good talk on this, so you should just watch this talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It's much better than this one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But, it's called The Future of Programming, and he explains all of the kind of mistakes we've made over the past decades with thinking about programming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And, specifically uses this, or for this context, he uses this example of how people found it very hard to go from binary to soap, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">The binary programmers could not understand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.100</a></span> | <span class="t">You could give up control to the machine and use these abstraction layers efficiently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And, they like to hand code everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And, of course, like, making this mind shift was really important, as we see in retrospect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, his lesson was, you should stop thinking in terms of procedures and start trying to think of programming in terms of goals and constraints.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And, pretty much guiding programs with these higher layers of abstraction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And, so, designers, I think, are actually pretty well suited to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.100</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it'll be a mindset shift to jump from thinking procedurally to goals and constraints.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.100</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we like to be very detailed in how we design user flows and consider all the edge cases and all that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And, it's very important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But, we are likely going to have to start to move up a layer of abstraction as we're seeing apps become more and more stochastic and dynamic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And, just more probabilistic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we can't really envision every possible path now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we have to think a bit more in terms of what constraints can we set and what goals can we set to get people along the happy path.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And, so, you know, design systems, these are already things we use to guide developers and our designers to goals and set constraints for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what happens when we start using this for generative UI, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.100</a></span> | <span class="t">If we start to collaborate with a model, do we have a design system that keeps them within the right constraints?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Quality assurance, is that like reinforcement learning?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

a model has created.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Will this be like

stories, these are, you know, we're very good as designers as thinking about how to envision what the user is trying to do via user stories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And, these are kind of like system prompts in a way, like can the model become also a partner in helping set the goal for a user?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And, we can translate some of these user stories into the system prompts themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is pretty speculative, but I think this is a nice prompt for the future of UI design in the AI age.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And, I'd like to end on this quote from Dario Amadai, who says he feels that generative AI systems are more grown than they are built.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And, I like this as a prompt for inspiration for helping us do this shift mindsets and start to think about how the future of UX might be more one where it's less like a process of construction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and perhaps more like a process of gardening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if we can embrace these types of lessons and start to think about design in a new way at a higher level, perhaps then we can move beyond the bitter layout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZtD0yYAgCQ&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks a
