This was like a Twitter thread on the topic of paradoxes. I wrote a sort of curation of like 20 of my favorite paradoxes that I feel like I've come across in my own life or that I've struggled with on a regular basis.</p><p>Fast forward to January, 2023, I wake up in the morning to a bunch of texts from friends saying like, Whoa, Bill Ackman shared your tweet thread. And he has quote tweeted this thread from November, 2021 saying a friend sent me this last week. It contains tons of wisdom. Everyone should read it.</p><p>So I replied to his tweet and say, thanks for sharing my work, Bill. We should get lunch in New York sometime on me. And he replies and says, would love to do that. And I ended up getting to have lunch with Bill Ackman as a result of this Twitter thread that I had written 18 months before a perfect example of expanding your luck surface area and how content is a great, great example of that.</p><p>Like you put something out into the world and it's still creating lucky encounters for you 18 months into the future.</p></div></div></body></html>
