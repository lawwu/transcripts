There are a few things that I think have worked for us that I'll call out. There have been moments where we're like, man, we have really figured out parenting. Things are just feeling really smooth and everything's humming along.</p><p>And it feels like just as you start to really nail parenting, everything changes. The developmental phases, the sleep regressions, sleep regressions, just variables in your external kind of kids' worlds that you can't control change. And now you're dealing with a whole new set of interesting challenges. So I think all this to say, just when you think you know it, it turns out you don't know it.</p><p>And you're having to relearn everything all over again in a very different way. And so I think that's very normal and something that we've learned to accept over time.</p></div></div></body></html>
