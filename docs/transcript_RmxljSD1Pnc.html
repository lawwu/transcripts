Look, I think there's three potential outcomes here. Outcome number one is that the courts decide that this is fair use and these AI companies aren't in violation of rights.</p><p>Outcome number two is that the courts throw a big wrench into it or a bill like Schiff's bill throws a big wrench into it. I think what happens then is new AI companies have a really hard time accumulating training data. Now you've created a real moat and barrier to entry, and it's going to be a big problem, I think, for the open source movement.</p><p>Outcome number three is you create some sort of rights clearinghouse, kind of like exists in the recording industry. That would be the compromise, in which case the incumbents probably like that because, again, they want there to be a barrier to entry. I don't know which one of the three it's going to be, but those are the three potential outcomes</p></div></div></body></html>
