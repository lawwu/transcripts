On one end, investing early in evaluations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is extremely important device, especially the more your agent becomes advanced, the more you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">can have an idea for introducing progressions or automated products. And the other wise observability,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we can go deeply there. As you know, we use LikesMeet pretty thoroughly. We also use another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">set of tools. I think we're all learning as a few top loops in the V2M agents. It's not really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">safe, but I may want to talk to other people in the past, but I guess...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the things that I'd love to hear more about, we did a separate fireside chat in December,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and we talked about the human in the loop experience and how that was important at the time. Now you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">saying these agents are more common. How do you think about that? Has that changed?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Or is that the way?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, you're still talking about this constant action between wanting to do the human in the loop,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">so that you can break the genetic flow and make sure that in particular sideways, the human can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">bring it back on trucks. At the same time, what we're saying from our users is that when the agent is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">actually working correctly, they don't want to be bothered, they just want to get things done. The more we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">can get done, it maybe takes a week for users to get used to that, and then they just want more. So, I think the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">strategy that we're following at the moment is, we try to move forward with other platforms, where a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">mobile app, for instance, obviously allows you to bring back the user to the connection. But at the same time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, there is always a chat, where you can ask the agent to stop, you can ask it to do a different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">work, even while it's having to work. So, it depends on the user profile. Some users have to be more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">trustworthy, and they have to deliver the agency to the agent, and some users are having more hands-on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and, you know, try to get a product that makes all of them active. But, I think the role we are all going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">towards, I think that would be interesting. On the, on the topic of, kind of, like, users,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">how, how are people, kind of, like, using Reply? What types of things are they building? What, like, what are their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">backgrounds? Who are the, the users that you're going to determine? Yeah, so, uh, starting from early</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">February, we, I mean, over three years or so, everyone can use, you know, Reply, just spinning out of town,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and we haven't got to think about the one-event application was per month. So, that's what I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">here, that we should be. Um, a lot of them are, that's how the agents can do it. And, I think, the same pie that we got, you know, when we were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">younger, we brought our first piece of clothing, we actually see the money, that's what a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">people are chasing the first time. Like, realizing that you can actually build software, even without</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">learning and improving the ground. At the same time, some of them get hooked up, and they realize, oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I can build what I need for my business, I can build something that I need at work. And, and that's when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">they start to work on much-conditioned applications. So, the, I think, one of the key</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">differences of our product is the fact that it's not used mostly to create simple, like, landing pages</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">or prototypes, but rather people find value on very long projects. Uh, I see people spending hundreds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of hours on a single project in the revenue page, running, absolutely no answer to it, just making</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">progress with the agent. That is, first of all, a great technical challenge, like this, because it makes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">things much harder for several different reasons. And, people are spending so much time, they are usually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">either building, uh, internal tools in companies. There's something I'm getting excited about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there's this concept of abandoning SaaS, the program comes about, the idea that, why would I spend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">seven figures buying an expensive SaaS when I need only two t-shirts? I'm going to rather rebuild it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and build volume to the new company. So, this is one direction that I, I see a lot more companies working on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But, at the same time, also personalized applications, uh, for, you know, uh, professionals,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like, even people that have their own monthly, otherwise it would stop replacing that. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that's, that's the kind of basic solution. Awesome. How, uh, so people who have agents and are maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">starting with agents on the, on the lower end of the topic and are thinking of letting it run now for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">10, 15 minutes, like, who are, how did you have the confidence to, like, do that? Like, when was the point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">where you're like, okay, bring the team out of the loop and we need to start letting it run? Is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">based on kind of, like, feedback from users, internal testing, metrics, like, what did that process to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that confidence look like? I would say a lot of internal testing. Even before we launched V1,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we had a prototype of it since early 2024. So, we've always been trying to make it work. And the moment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we find the right blocks, uh, which partially are due to what computer labs are working on. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the new models that they give us, uh, at the same time, it's also due to how good is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff that we're feeling. The moment it works well enough then, that's when we start to feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we should launch this, we should put it at least in front of a small, you know, alpha users cohort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">What I think we do is that we, we re-architected it to, you know, to best leverage the database models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">up there, and then we start to use it a lot internally. And we started with a approach that was a bit more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">similar to V1, so we were more cautious, and then we just gave more niche. So, we wanted to say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, how far can we take these? How good is it going to work?

Um, so, I think I went on our podcast from, you know, last year for us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, last year for us, saying that, you know, the three, the three dimensions we want to optimize are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">performance, cost, and latency. And, for me, performance and cost are almost, you know, uh, the same level in terms of importance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And that, really, back in the, in one days, I was using it as, as a, as a partner. Um, it doesn't change much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Today, we, too, we find that gap has become even wider.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it runs for so long. It runs for so long, and possibly there was the scariest that we did when we launched it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">especially when we put it, uh, and we made the GA. And the reason is we were already not emphasizing how much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the data components. Like, we strongly believe that it's far more important for the agent to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">done what people want, and especially for the ICT that we've been wanting, which is contacting our people. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">so, we have almost like one of the 90% of, uh, additional latency. And the reaction has been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">fairly more controversial.

How do the users know when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it's done? Or are they just keeping the browser open and looking there? Do you have, like, Slack</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">notifications?

Right. Yeah, so we, we won,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">most of the users were in front of the screen of design, because the feedback loop was relatively short,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and I think it was also quite a bit to learn from, from what the agent was doing. It's still the case today, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it's fairly verbose if you're curious to get a basic experiment every single action it does. If you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">want, you can see the output of every single tool we run, you can try to be as transparent as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So there is a subset of users that are using the agent not only because they want to build something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">but also because they want to speed run their learning experiments.

To make sure that the loop is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a bit tighter, uh, the replica mobile app that is available on, you know, apps around, right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">um, sends a notification to when the agent wants, what's with you. And the vision that we have for the next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">release is to send even fewer information. And the idea is, right now, one button is for us, which is the fact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that we rely solely on the last professional.

That's what, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1081" target="_blank">00:18:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you can.

We're not there yet. So what I, the challenge is to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">make that people that want to use it as a chatbot, so that they do basically one single task at a time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and we've got some effort in training. We did that course with Andrea, who's going to be on stage in a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">hours, just to tell people if you want to use it that way, it's important that you split your main goal into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">sub-tasks, and basically some people say much. But at the same time, I would love to reach a point where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1127" target="_blank">00:18:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we go through each sub-tasking as they show, we get things done, and maybe after we ask, let's say for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">one hour, then it's up to use a user to find out if you accomplish everything that you want to. But I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">there is so much that can be done autonomously, because you'll say 90% of what user wants, and then when we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">gather attention to that, because it has to do that to polish the user's penis by messing things up what it wants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1154" target="_blank">00:19:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You mentioned, um, you mentioned observability and thinking about that early on. As, what have you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">learned as, as RepletAgent has gone crazy viral? That observability is even harder than it expected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Regardless of the fact that you guys are feeling something awesome in linespain. What are, what are the hardest parts?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Give us some product ideas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1177" target="_blank">00:19:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So, first of all, I, this is a bit like back in the days when we were discussing, what is the best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1184" target="_blank">00:19:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">possible architecture for databases? But we do this, you know, one size does not fit all in this case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1190" target="_blank">00:19:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are the DataDoc style observability that is still the useful, like you want to have aggregates,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1197" target="_blank">00:19:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to have to have your, you know, you're failing to use this tool 50% of the times, and then bring an alert and go ahead and fix it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1205" target="_blank">00:20:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">At the same time, something like Blacksmith is extremely important, because, unfortunately, we're still at the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1211" target="_blank">00:20:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of, like, assembly era, you know what I mean, for agents, you will agree with me, because when you are trying to understand why the agent has made, you know, the wrong choice, you know, sideways,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">your last resort is to actually read and carry you from the output, the generated output, and trying to figure out why the agent has been made.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1233" target="_blank">00:20:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's much more effort compared to what advances in the system, like, aggregates, and whatnot, you know, you have something that is, like, a strategy darker,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1243" target="_blank">00:20:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but rather, you need to read a hundred thousand tokens and figure out what's wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1249" target="_blank">00:20:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think we are at the early stages of observing, but what I recommend everyone who starts to weave from being an agent or, like, any agent in workflow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1259" target="_blank">00:20:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is to invest in the server BPP company, otherwise, you're going to be lost immediately, and you're probably going to be lost because you're going to think it's impossible to do this off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1269" target="_blank">00:21:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I hope that we are proof, and the other companies are proof that it's not impossible, it's just really hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So, who do you see kind of be the best, who debuts these agents, is it everyone on the team?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1281" target="_blank">00:21:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you guys are building a technical product, so, so, probably everyone has some product sense and product feel for it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1287" target="_blank">00:21:27.920</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">who has the best kind of, like, skilled or natural intuition for that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1299" target="_blank">00:21:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Given the size of Rappi today, you are, like, barely 75 people across the entire company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1305"

something is broken, mostly people in tech, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.240</a></span> |

So, I included one of them, you know, I expect us to bring in real use,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1371" target="_blank">00:22:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or in general, I can bring in research and test applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1375" target="_blank">00:22:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">At the same time, I'm also a very good shot of reading in software tests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1379" target="_blank">00:22:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">The beauty of getting a coding agent is that all these are more observable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1386" target="_blank">00:23:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and there are ways that you can apply the code to test if it's correct or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1391" target="_blank">00:23:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And, last but not least, I would want to work even for the test side of computing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">We are, as of today, we already used a fair amount of tokens, as you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1401" target="_blank">00:23:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But, definitely, we want to explore both sampling and parallelism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we see this especially at the beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1409" target="_blank">00:23:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of our users have opened several projects in parallel, and to the initial view,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">so that they can see which one matches their UI base for better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1417" target="_blank">00:23:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I imagine taking this concept and carrying along the dark trajectory,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">where you sample and then you run to be like the best solution for the problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this would be like a power of expanders, but it definitely helps to get better performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIGuU_BhEc&t=1430" target="_blank">00:23:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Awesome.
