But then you kind of realize that 70, 80% isn't quite good enough. And that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">if you want to get past that 70, 80% quality bar, you're seven layers deep in a call stack</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to reverse engineer.

I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.140</a></span> | <span class="t">was like, here's my make file.

Couldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.060</a></span> | <span class="t">figure it out. Did all the things in the wrong order. I'm like, cool, let's fix the prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And over the next two hours, I had more and more detail about what everything was and every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.780</a></span> | <span class="t">single step until I got to the point where I was like, this is the exact order to run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the build steps. It was a cool exercise. But at the end of it, I was like, you know, I could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">have written the bash script to do this in about 90 seconds. Not every problem needs an agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I've been on this journey. I think a lot of you have been on similar journeys.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And what happened was is I went and talked in trying to help people build better, more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">reliable agents. I talked to 100 plus founders, builders, engineers. And I sort of noticed patterns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">One was that most production agents weren't that agentic at all. They were mostly just software.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But that there were these core things that a lot of people were doing. There were these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">patterns that were making their LLM-based apps really, really good. And none of them were doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of a greenfield rewrite. Rather, they were taking these small modular concepts that didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">have names and didn't have definitions. And they were applying them to their existing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">code. And what's really cool about this, I don't think you need an AI background to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this. This is software engineering 101. Well, probably not 101. But just like Heroku needed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to define what it meant to build -- we didn't even call them cloud native back then. But this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.620</a></span> | <span class="t">was how you built applications that could run in the cloud 10 years ago. I decided to put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">together what I thought would be the 12 factors of AI agents from everything that I've seen working</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.380</a></span> | <span class="t">in the field. So we put up this GitHub repo. You can go read it. Turns out a lot of other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">people agreed and felt the same thing. So we were on the front page of Hacker News all day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.860</a></span> | <span class="t">200K impressions on social. I'm just gonna put this one up and no comment.

So what am I here to do? I want you to kind of forget</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.020</a></span> | <span class="t">everything you know about agents and kind of rethink from first principles how we can apply</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">everything we've learned from software engineering to the practice of building really reliable agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're gonna mix the order up a little bit. If you want all 12 factors in order, that's a 30-minute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.220</a></span> | <span class="t">talk.

You can go dig</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.900</a></span> | <span class="t">through it at your ledger. Factor one, the most magical things that LLMs can do has nothing to do with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">loops or switch statements or code or tools or anything. It is turning a sentence like this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">into JSON that looks like this. Doesn't even matter what you do with that JSON. Those are what the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.620</a></span> | <span class="t">factors are for. But if you're doing that, that's one piece that you can bring into your app today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Factor four, this leads right to... Did anyone read this paper, GoTo Considered Harmful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.460</a></span> | <span class="t">or maybe just heard about it? I never actually read it. But it was all about... We had this abstraction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.380</a></span> | <span class="t">in the C programming language and a bunch of other programming languages at the time that said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.380</a></span> | <span class="t">This thing, GoTo, it makes code terrible. It's the wrong abstraction. No one should use it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm gonna go ahead and go out on a limb here and say tool use is harmful. And I put it in quotes because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not talking about giving an agent access to the world. Obviously, that's super badass. But what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I think is making things hard is the idea that tool use is this magical thing where this ethereal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">alien entity is interacting with its environment. Because what is happening is our LM is putting out JSON.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">We're gonna give that to some deterministic code that's gonna do something. And then maybe we'll feed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">it back. But again, those are other factors. So if you have structures like this, and you can get the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.300</a></span> | <span class="t">LLM to output something that generates them, then you can pass it into a loop like this or a switch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">statement like this. There's nothing special about tools. It's just JSON and code. That's factor four.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Factor eight. And these are, we're gonna do a couple kind of bundled together here. Owning your control flow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want to take a step back and kind of talk about how we got here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We've been writing DAGs in software for a long time. If you've written an if statement, you've written a directed graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Code is a graph. You may also be familiar with DAG orchestra. Anyone ever use like Airflow or Prefect or any of these things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So like this kind of concept of breaking things up into nodes gives you certain reliability guarantees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But what agents were supposed to do, and I think a lot of people talk about this, and I think in some cases</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">this is realized, is you don't have to write the DAG. You just tell the LLM here's the goal, and LLM will find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.820</a></span> | <span class="t">its way there. And we model this as a really simple loop. You know, LLM is determining the next step.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You're building up some context window until the LLM says, "Hey, we're done."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So what this looks like kind of in practice is, you know, you have an event come in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You pass it into your prompt. It says you want to call an API. And you get your result. Put that on the context window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Pass the whole thing back into the prompt. This is like the most naive, simple way of building agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And the LLM is gonna call a couple steps. And then eventually it's gonna say, "Cool, we've done all the tasks from the initial event."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Which maybe was a user message asking it to do something. Maybe it's an outage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But then we get our final answer.

Especially when you get to longer workflows. Mostly it's long context windows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.460</a></span> | <span class="t">There's other reasons you could poke at as well. And people say, "Oh, like, anyone put, like, two million tokens into Gemini before and, like, try to see what happens?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you can do it. You'll get an answer. The API will return you something. But I don't think anyone will argue with you that you will always get, like, tighter, better, higher reliability results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.820</a></span> | <span class="t">By controlling and limiting the number of tokens you put in that context window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So it doesn't quite work, but we're gonna use that as our abstraction to build on. What's an agent really?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">You have your prompt, which gives instructions about how to select the next step.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.900</a></span> | <span class="t">You have your switch statement, which takes whatever the model output JSON and does something with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.900</a></span> | <span class="t">You have a way of building up your context window.

Otherwise, we hand it back to a little rollback agent that is very similar on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">the inside. I'm not going to go into it, but here's it working in our Slack channel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, 100 tools, 20 steps, easy. Manageable context, clear responsibilities. A lot of people say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.980</a></span> | <span class="t">what if LLMs do keep getting smarter? What if I can put two million tokens in and it can do it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we very much will see something like this, where you start with a mostly deterministic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.060</a></span> | <span class="t">workflow and you start sprinkling LLMs into your code, into your back end, into your logic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Over time, the LLMs are able to do bigger, more complex tasks until this whole API endpoint or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">pipeline or whatever it is is just run by an agent. That's great. But you still want to know how to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.340</a></span> | <span class="t">engineer these things to get the best quality. This is someone from Notebook LM and it's basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.500</a></span> | <span class="t">their take, and I think they did this well, is find something that is right at the boundary of what the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.740</a></span> | <span class="t">model can do reliably, like that it can't get right all the time. And if you can figure out how to get it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">right reliably anyways, because you've engineered reliability into your system, then you will have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">created something magical and you will have created something that's better than what everybody else is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">building. So that's small focused agents. There's a meme here about stateless reducers. I guess someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">actually tweeted at me it's not a reducer, it's a transducer, because there's multiple steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically agents should be stateless, you should own the state, manage it however you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're all still finding the right abstractions. There's a couple blog posts I link in the paper,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">frameworks versus libraries. There's a really old one from RubyConf about like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">do we want duplication or is like, do we want to try to figure out these abstractions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to make a 12 factor agent, we are working on something called create 12 factor agent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.100</a></span> | <span class="t">because I believe that what agents need is not bootstrap. You don't need a wrapper around an internal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">thing. You need something more like shad CN, which is like scaffold it out and then I'll own it and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll own the code and I'm okay with that. So in summary, agents are software. You all can build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.700</a></span> | <span class="t">software. Anyone ever written a switch statement before? While loop? Yeah. Okay, so we can do this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.740</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff. LMs are stateless functions, which means just make sure you put the right things in the context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and you'll get the best results. Own your state and your control flow and just do it and just understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=926" target="_blank">00:15:26.460</a></span> | <span class="t">it because it's going to give you flexibility. And then find the bleeding edge. Find ways to do things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">better than everybody else by really curating what you put in the model and how you control</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.220</a></span> | <span class="t">what comes out. And my take, agents are better with people. Find ways to let agents collaborate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">with humans. There are hard things in building agents, but you should probably do them anyways,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.940</a></span> | <span class="t">at least for now. And you should do most of them. I think a lot of frameworks try to take away the hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=953" target="_blank">00:15:53.500</a></span> | <span class="t">AI parts of the problem so that you can just kind of drop it in and go. And I think it should be the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.020</a></span> | <span class="t">opposite. I think the tools that we get should take away the other hard parts so that we can spend all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.300</a></span> | <span class="t">our time focusing on the hard AI parts, on getting the prompts right, on getting the flow right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.380</a></span> | <span class="t">on getting the tokens right. So the reason why I'm here is I do run a small business. We have a startup</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">where we try to help you do... A lot of what we do in the open is open source, and I think it's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">important and we need to work on it together. There's some other things that are hard, but not that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">important and not that interesting.

Working on something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kMaTybvDUw&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.380</a></span> | <span class="t">called A2H protocol.
