The more busy you get, especially in business, but honestly, in any area, like I know how painful it is to work with the IRS. Like, even if I got audited today, I would be stressed about it.</p><p>I'd be in the driver's seat, so I'm not going to like crazy worry, but it would stress me out because I know just the time it takes would be honestly a huge loss in money to me, right? Huge loss in energy, effort, everything. So everything I do is built around that.</p><p>And obviously transcripts is one of them. I like to actually extend so that I have a clean, I want one return, submit it. That's it. And then everything I do is clean. So it's like, if I think I'm going to assume the IRS is looking at my return. If there's anything that they're going to be like, Hmm, that doesn't look good.</p><p>I would prefer to not make it stand out without misrepresenting.</p></div></div></body></html>
