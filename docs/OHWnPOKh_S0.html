we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">know about Greek and Roman

It actually turns out he can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5334" target="_blank">01:28:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">talk to his board and Mark talks to us about many things that he does that most CEOs won't talk to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5338" target="_blank">01:28:58.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the boards about because we literally, because we can't fire him. Um, but the general, a general C,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5343" target="_blank">01:29:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">including all the CEOs of Twitter that, that none of them had control. And so they could all get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5346" target="_blank">01:29:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">fired. So, um, you can't talk to the board members. They're going to fire you. You can't talk to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5350" target="_blank">01:29:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">shareholders because they'll just like dump your stock, right? Like, okay, so who's the, so, so the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5355" target="_blank">01:29:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">so every once in a while, what you find is basically the best case scenario they have is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5359" target="_blank">01:29:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">they can talk to other CEOs. Um, and there's these little organizations where they kind of pair up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5363" target="_blank">01:29:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and do that. And so they maybe get a little bit out of that, but, but even that's fraught with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5366" target="_blank">01:29:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">peril because can you really talk about confidential information with another CEO</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5369" target="_blank">01:29:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">insider trading risk? Um, and so it's just a very, it's just a very lonely and isolating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5374" target="_blank">01:29:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">thing to start with. Um, and then you, you, and then on top of that, you apply pressure,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5379" target="_blank">01:29:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">um, right. And that's where it gets painful. And then maybe I'll just spend a moment on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5382" target="_blank">01:29:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this internal external pressure thing. Um, my general experience with companies is that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5388" target="_blank">01:29:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">can withstand most forms of external pressure as long as they retain internal coherence,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5393" target="_blank">01:29:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So as long as the internal team, um, is really bonded together and supporting each other,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5400" target="_blank">01:30:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">um, most forms of external pressure you can withstand. And by that, I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5404" target="_blank">01:30:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">investors stopped your stock, you lose your biggest customers, you know, whatever negative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5410" target="_blank">01:30:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">article, you know, negative headline, you know, um, you can, you can withstand all that. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5414" target="_blank">01:30:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">basically, and in fact, many of those forms of pressure can be bonding experiences for the team</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5417" target="_blank">01:30:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">where they, where they, where they come out stronger. Um, what you 100% cannot withstand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5422" target="_blank">01:30:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is the internal crack. And what I always look for in high pressure corporate situations now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5427" target="_blank">01:30:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is the moment when the internal team cracks, because I know the minute that happens,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5432" target="_blank">01:30:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we're in a different regime. Like it's like the, you know, the solid has turned into a liquid,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5437" target="_blank">01:30:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like we're in a different regime. And like the whole thing can unravel in the next week. Cause</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5440" target="_blank">01:30:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">then people turn it. I mean, this is, I guess this is what's happening in Los Angeles right now. The,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5444" target="_blank">01:30:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the, the, the mayor and the fire chief turned on each other and that's it. That government is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5450" target="_blank">01:30:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">dysfunctional.

It is not going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5453" target="_blank">01:30:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">work ever again. And that's what happens inside companies. Um, and so, so, so somebody like Mark</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5459" target="_blank">01:30:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is under like profound internal pressure and external pressure at the same time. Now he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5464" target="_blank">01:31:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">been very good at maintaining the coherence of his executive team, but he has had over the years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5469" target="_blank">01:31:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of activist employees, um, as a lot of these companies have had. And so that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5473" target="_blank">01:31:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">been continuous pressure. And then the final thing I'd say, as I said, that companies can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5477" target="_blank">01:31:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">withstand most forms of external pressure, but not all in the special, though, not all one is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5481" target="_blank">01:31:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">government pressure. Um, is that when your government comes for you, like yeah, any CEO</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5488" target="_blank">01:31:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">who thinks that they're bigger than the government, um, has that notion beaten out of them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5491" target="_blank">01:31:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in short order. Can you just linger on that? Cause it is, uh, maybe educating and deeply</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5498" target="_blank">01:31:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">disturbing. You've spoken about it before, but we're speaking about again, this government</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5503" target="_blank">01:31:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">pressure. So you think they've crossed the line into essentially criminal levels of pressure,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5510" target="_blank">01:31:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">flagrant criminality, felonies, like obvious felonies. And I can, I can actually cite the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5515" target="_blank">01:31:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">laws, but yes, uh, absolute criminality. Can you explain how those possible to happen?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5523" target="_blank">01:32:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe on a hopeful note, how we can avoid that happening again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5527" target="_blank">01:32:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So as to start with is a lot of this now is in the public record, um, which is good because it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5532" target="_blank">01:32:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">needs to be in the public record. And so there's, there's three forms of things that are in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5535" target="_blank">01:32:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">public record that people can look at. So one is the Twitter files, um, right. We, which Elon put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5539" target="_blank">01:32:19.240</a></span> | <span class="t">out with a set of journalists when he took over. And I will just tell you, the Twitter files are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5542" target="_blank">01:32:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a hundred percent representative of what I've seen at every other one of these companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5545" target="_blank">01:32:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can just see what happened in Twitter and you can just assume that that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5549" target="_blank">01:32:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">happened in these other companies. Um, you know, for the most part, certainly in terms of the kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5553" target="_blank">01:32:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of pressure that they got. So that's, that's number one, that stuff, you can just read it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5556" target="_blank">01:32:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and you should, if you haven't. Um, the second is, um, Mark references in the Rogan podcast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5561" target="_blank">01:32:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a Congressman Jim Jordan who has a committee congressional committee called the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5565" target="_blank">01:32:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">weaponization committee. And they, in the last, you know, whatever, three years have done a full</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5569" target="_blank">01:32:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">scale investigation of this and Facebook produced a lot of documents into that investigation. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5574" target="_blank">01:32:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">those have many of those have now been made public and you can download those reports.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5577" target="_blank">01:32:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's like, I'd like 2000 pages worth of material on that. And that's essentially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5581" target="_blank">01:33:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the Facebook version of the Twitter files just arrived at with a different mechanism. Um, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5586" target="_blank">01:33:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">then third is Mark himself talking about this on, on, on, on Rogan. So I'll just defer to his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5590" target="_blank">01:33:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">comments there, but yeah, basically what, what those three forms of information show you is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5594" target="_blank">01:33:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">basically the government, you know, over time, um, and then culminating in 2020, 2021, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5600" target="_blank">01:33:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">in the last four years, just decided that the first amendment didn't apply to them.

Um, and you know, there's this whole thing of like, well, the first amendment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5627" target="_blank">01:33:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">only applies to, you know, the government, it doesn't apply to companies. It's like, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5630" target="_blank">01:33:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">there's actually a little bit of nuance to that. First of all, it definitely applies to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5634" target="_blank">01:33:54.680</a></span> | <span class="t">government. Like 100%, the first amendment applies to the government by the way. So does the fourth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5640" target="_blank">01:34:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">amendment and the fifth amendment, including the right to due process also applies to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5643" target="_blank">01:34:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">government.

Those are just as serious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5652" target="_blank">01:34:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">violations as the, as the free speech violations. And so this is just like flagrant, flagrant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5657" target="_blank">01:34:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">unconstitutional behavior. And then there are specific federal statutes.

We could talk about that, but, but,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5842" target="_blank">01:37:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">but even beyond that, mostly what we're dealing with is not legislation. When we talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5846" target="_blank">01:37:26.360</a></span> | <span class="t">government power these days, mostly it's not legislation. Um, mostly it's either regulation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5850" target="_blank">01:37:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">which is basically the equivalent of legislation, but having not gone through the legislative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5854" target="_blank">01:37:34.520</a></span> | <span class="t">process, which is a very big open legal issue.

Like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5877" target="_blank">01:37:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">they can completely wreck your company with no ability, no ability for you to do anything about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5880" target="_blank">01:38:00.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it. So, so, so regulation is a big part of the way the power gets exercised. And then there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5885" target="_blank">01:38:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what's called just flat out administrative power, the term that you'll hear.

And they went to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5906" target="_blank">01:38:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">government and they went to the, all these different, try to figure out how to make it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5909" target="_blank">01:38:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was like fully compliant with anti-money laundering and all these, you know, controls and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5912" target="_blank">01:38:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">everything.

Two senators wrote letters to the big banks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5916" target="_blank">01:38:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">um, saying, we're not telling you that you can't work with Facebook on this, but if you do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5922" target="_blank">01:38:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you should know that every aspect of your business is going to come under greatly increased level of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5927" target="_blank">01:38:47.080</a></span> | <span class="t">regulatory scrutiny, which is of course the exact equivalent of, it sure is a nice corner restaurant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5932" target="_blank">01:38:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you have here.

Right. And so that like, what is that letter? Like, it's not a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5940" target="_blank">01:39:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">law. It's not even a regulation. It's just like straight direct state power. And then, and then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5946" target="_blank">01:39:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and then it culminates in literally calls from the white house where they're just like flat out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5950" target="_blank">01:39:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">telling you what to do, which is of course what a King gets to do, but not what a president gets to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5954" target="_blank">01:39:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">do.

It was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5963" target="_blank">01:39:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">actually legislation was the least important part.

And then just like flat out demands, um, and flat out threats were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5971" target="_blank">01:39:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">ultimately the most important. How do you fix it? Well, first of all, like you have to elect people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=5976" target="_blank">01:39:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">who don't do it.

So like, for example, it's, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6225" target="_blank">01:43:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">for the last couple of weeks it's been him, you know, kind of weighing in on this rape gang scandal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6229" target="_blank">01:43:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, this rape organized child rape thing in the UK.

They weren't willing to talk about it. It kind of got suppressed. Um, and then, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6243" target="_blank">01:44:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Elon brought it up and then all of a sudden there's now in the UK, this like massive explosion of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6247" target="_blank">01:44:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">basically open conversation about it for the first time. And you know, it's like this catalyzing all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6251" target="_blank">01:44:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of a sudden everybody's kind of woken up and being like, oh my God, you know, this is really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6254" target="_blank">01:44:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">bad. And then there will be now, you know, pretty sure pretty, pretty clearly big changes as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6258" target="_blank">01:44:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">result. So, and Elon was, you know, he played the role of the boy who said the emperor has no clothes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6263" target="_blank">01:44:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">right. But, but, but here's the thing, here's my point. Like he said it about something that was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6267" target="_blank">01:44:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">true, right. And so had he said it about something that was false, you know, he would get no credit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6272" target="_blank">01:44:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">for it. He wouldn't deserve any credit for it, but he said something that was true. And by the way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6276" target="_blank">01:44:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">everybody over there instantly, they were like, oh yeah, he's right. Right. Like nobody, nobody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6280" target="_blank">01:44:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">seriously said they're just arguing the details now. So, so number one, it's like, okay, he says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6284" target="_blank">01:44:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">true things. And so it's like, okay, how far, I'll put it this way, like how worried are we about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6289" target="_blank">01:44:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody becoming corrupt by virtue of their power being that they get to speak the truth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6293" target="_blank">01:44:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I guess I would say, especially in the last decade of what we've been through, where everybody's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6297" target="_blank">01:44:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">been lying all the time about everything, I'd say, I think we should run this experiment as hard as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6301" target="_blank">01:45:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we can to get people to tell the truth. And so, uh, I don't feel that bad about that. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6305" target="_blank">01:45:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the money side, you know, this rapidly gets into the money and politics question and the money and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6310" target="_blank">01:45:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">politics question is this very interesting question because, um, it seems like if there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6315" target="_blank">01:45:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a clear cut case that the more money in politics, the worst things are, and the more corrupted the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6319" target="_blank">01:45:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">system is.

And once again, Trump spent far less, you know, Kamala raised and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6335" target="_blank">01:45:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">spent 1.5 billion on top of what Biden had spent.

And so they, they thought through it very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=6774" target="_blank">01:52:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">carefully, but just I'll give you an example, which continues to be a hot topic.

So I think he's having a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7484" target="_blank">02:04:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I would put him up there with Elon in terms of somebody who's really affecting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7486" target="_blank">02:04:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">how all this is playing out.

And so they went through the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7713" target="_blank">02:08:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">term, and they just learned how everything works.

Well, I think one of the concerns is actually that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7768" target="_blank">02:09:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">given the human being of Donald Trump, that there would be more tendency towards, let's say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7777" target="_blank">02:09:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">favoritism versus meritocracy, that there's circles of sycophancy that form. And if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7785" target="_blank">02:09:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">be able to be loyal and never oppose and just be basically suck up to the president,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7793" target="_blank">02:09:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that you will get a position. So that's one of the concerns. And I think you're in a good position to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7797" target="_blank">02:09:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">speak to the degree that's happening versus hiring based on merit and just getting great teams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7806" target="_blank">02:10:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So look, just start by saying any leader at that level, by the way, any CEO, there's always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7811" target="_blank">02:10:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">some risk of that, right? So it's like a natural reality warps around powerful leaders. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7817" target="_blank">02:10:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">there's always some risk to that. Of course, the good and powerful leaders are very aware of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7820" target="_blank">02:10:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And Trump at this point in his life, I think, is highly aware of that. At least my interactions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7823" target="_blank">02:10:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">with him, he definitely seems very aware of that.

I would just say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7829" target="_blank">02:10:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the way to look at that, I mean, look, like I said, I don't want to predict what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7832" target="_blank">02:10:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">going to happen once this whole thing starts unfolding.

So to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7961" target="_blank">02:12:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody like that in there...

And then I just, I'd be quite honest, I do the compare and contrast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=7971" target="_blank">02:12:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of the last four years and it's not even...

I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8036" target="_blank">02:13:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">doing it, but again, I'm volunteering to help as much as I can and I'm 100% supportive. Yeah. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8042" target="_blank">02:14:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">look, I think the way to think of... I mean, the basic outlines are in public, right? Which is it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8047" target="_blank">02:14:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a time-limited basically commission. It's not a formal government agency. It's a time-limited 18</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8053" target="_blank">02:14:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">month. In terms of implementation, it will advise the executive branch, right? And so the implementation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8060" target="_blank">02:14:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">will happen through the White House. And the president has total latitude on what he wants to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8065" target="_blank">02:14:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">implement. And then basically what I think about it is three kind of streams, kind of target sets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8071" target="_blank">02:14:31.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're related, but different. So money, people, and regulations. And so the headline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8077" target="_blank">02:14:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">number, they put the $2 trillion number and there's already disputes over that and whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8081" target="_blank">02:14:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a whole question there, but then there's the people thing. And the people thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8085" target="_blank">02:14:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is interesting because you get into these very kind of fascinating questions. And I've been doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8090" target="_blank">02:14:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">this. I won't do this for you as a pop quiz, but I do this for people in government as a pop quiz.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8094" target="_blank">02:14:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I can stump them every time, which is A, how many federal agencies are there? And the answer is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8100" target="_blank">02:15:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">somewhere between 450 and 520, and nobody's quite sure. And then the other is how many people work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8105" target="_blank">02:15:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">for the federal government? And the answer is something on the order, I forget, but like 4</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8110" target="_blank">02:15:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">million full-time employees and maybe up to 20 million contractors and nobody's quite sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8113" target="_blank">02:15:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's a large people component to this. And then by the way, there's a related component</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8119" target="_blank">02:15:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to that, which is how many of them are actually in the office? And the answer is not many. Most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8124" target="_blank">02:15:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of the federal buildings are still empty. And then there's questions of are people working from home</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8129" target="_blank">02:15:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">or are we actually working from home? So there's the people dimension. And of course, the money and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8133" target="_blank">02:15:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the people are connected. And then there's the third, which is the regulation thing. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8137" target="_blank">02:15:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">described earlier how basically our system of government is much more now based on regulations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8141" target="_blank">02:15:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">than legislation. Most of the rules that we all live under are not from a bill that went through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8146" target="_blank">02:15:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Congress. They're from an agency that created a regulation. That turns out to be very, very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8151" target="_blank">02:15:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">important. So one is, Elon already described, we want to do, the Doge wants to do broad-based</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8155" target="_blank">02:15:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">regulatory relief. And Trump has talked about this and basically get the government off people's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8158" target="_blank">02:15:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">backs and liberate the American people to be able to do things again. So that's part of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8163" target="_blank">02:16:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's also something else that's happened, which is very interesting, which was there were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8166" target="_blank">02:16:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">a set of Supreme Court decisions about two years ago that went directly after the idea that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8171" target="_blank">02:16:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">executive branch can create regulatory agencies and issue regulations and enforce those regulations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8177" target="_blank">02:16:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">without corresponding congressional legislation.

Most of it is regulation. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8194" target="_blank">02:16:34.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the Supreme Court basically said large parts, large to maybe all of that regulation that did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8200" target="_blank">02:16:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">not directly result from a bill that went through Congress the way that the cartoon said that it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8204" target="_blank">02:16:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">should, that may not actually be legal. Now, the previous White House, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8211" target="_blank">02:16:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">was super in favor of big government.

They didn't pull anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8216" target="_blank">02:16:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">back in.

And we have to unwind the regulations, which are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8231" target="_blank">02:17:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">no longer legal, constitutional.

They have, I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8244" target="_blank">02:17:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">say, incredibly creative ideas on how to deal with this. I know lots of former government people who,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8250" target="_blank">02:17:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">100% of them, are super cynical on this topic.

And so over the course of the next few months,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8269" target="_blank">02:17:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that'll start to become visible.

So I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8863" target="_blank">02:27:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">describe what I have as a complex or nuanced, hopefully nuanced, view on this issue that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8867" target="_blank">02:27:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe a little bit different than what a lot of my peers have. And I think, and I kind of thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8873" target="_blank">02:27:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">about this, I didn't say anything about it all the way through the big kind of debate over Christmas,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8876" target="_blank">02:27:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but I thought about it a lot and read everything. I think what I realized is that I just have a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8881" target="_blank">02:28:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">different perspective on some of these things. And the reason is because of the combination of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8885" target="_blank">02:28:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">where I came from and then where I ended up.

And I have made the pro-skilled, high-skilled immigration argument many, many times,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8896" target="_blank">02:28:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the H-1B argument many times. In past lives, I've been in DC many times arguing with prior</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8902" target="_blank">02:28:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">administrations about this, always on the side of trying to get more H-1Bs and trying to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8906" target="_blank">02:28:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">more high-skilled immigration. And I think that argument is very strong and very solid and very,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8912" target="_blank">02:28:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">has paid off for the US in many, many ways. And we can go through it, but I think it's the argument</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8917" target="_blank">02:28:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">everybody already knows.

And then it's not just good for them and it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8941" target="_blank">02:29:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">just good for Silicon Valley or the tech industry. It's good for the country because they then create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8945" target="_blank">02:29:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">new companies and create new technologies and create new industries that then create many more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8949" target="_blank">02:29:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">jobs for Americans, native-born Americans than would have previously existed.

I'm very comfortable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8977" target="_blank">02:29:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">with that argument.

And then the other part is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=8984" target="_blank">02:29:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">look, I benefit every day.

Um, and what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9629" target="_blank">02:40:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">was happening at all the top institutions for Jewish applicants was they were being managed down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9633" target="_blank">02:40:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">as they were being actively managed down as a percentage of the, of, of, of the base.

And, and, you know, there's a whole backstory here, which is a hundred</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9652" target="_blank">02:40:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">years ago, Jews were not admitted into a lot of these institutions. And then there was a big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9655" target="_blank">02:40:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">campaign to get them in. Once they could get in, they immediately became 30% of these institutions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9659" target="_blank">02:40:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">because there's so many smart, talented Jews. So it went from 0% to 30%. And then the most recent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9665" target="_blank">02:41:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">generation of leadership has been trying to get it done to 2%. And a lot of Jewish people, at least</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9669" target="_blank">02:41:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of Jewish people I know sort of, they kind of knew this was happening, but they discovered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9673" target="_blank">02:41:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it the hard way, uh, after October 7th. Right. And so all of a sudden, so basically the Supreme</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9679" target="_blank">02:41:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">court case meant that you could address this in terms of the Asian victims, the October 7th meant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9684" target="_blank">02:41:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that you could address it in terms of the Jewish victims. And for sure, both of those groups are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9688" target="_blank">02:41:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">being systematically excluded. Right. And then of course, um, there's the thing that you basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9692" target="_blank">02:41:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">can't talk about, which is all the white people are being excluded. And then it turns out it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9697" target="_blank">02:41:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">also happening to black people. And this is the thing that like blew my freaking mind when I found</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9703" target="_blank">02:41:43.240</a></span> | <span class="t">out about it. So, um, I just assumed that like, this was great news for like American blacks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9708" target="_blank">02:41:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">because like, you know, obviously if, you know, whites, Asians, and Jews are being excluded,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9712" target="_blank">02:41:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">then, you know, the whole point of this in the beginning was to get the black population up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9716" target="_blank">02:41:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this must be great for American blacks. So then I discovered this New York times article</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9720" target="_blank">02:42:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">from 2004, um, called, um, blacks are being admitted into top schools at greater numbers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9725" target="_blank">02:42:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but which ones, uh, and again, and by the way, this is in the New York times, this is not in like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=9732" target="_blank">02:42:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, whatever national review.

Um, uh, they run this every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10772" target="_blank">02:59:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">year.

Um, and then it's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10785" target="_blank">02:59:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the scholarship amount is like $2,500, right?

I'll give you one more kicker on this topic. If you're not, if I haven't beaten it to death,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10835" target="_blank">03:00:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">um, you know, the SAT has changed. Um, so the SAT used to be a highly accurate proxy for IQ,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10841" target="_blank">03:00:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">um, that caused a bunch of problems. People really don't like the whole idea of IQ. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10848" target="_blank">03:00:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and so the SAT has been actively managed over the last 50 years by the college board that runs it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10853" target="_blank">03:00:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it has been essentially like everything else. It's been dumbed down. Um, and so the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10858" target="_blank">03:00:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the, in, in, in two ways, um, number one, it's been dumbed down where, uh, an 800 from 40 years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10863" target="_blank">03:01:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">ago does not mean what an 800 means today. Um, and 800, 40 years ago, it was almost impossible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10868" target="_blank">03:01:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to get an 800. Uh, today there's, today there's so many eight hundreds that you could stock the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10872" target="_blank">03:01:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">entire Ivy league with eight hundreds. Right. Um, and so, so, so, so it's been deliberately dumbed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10877" target="_blank">03:01:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">down. Um, and then two is they have, they have tried to pull out a lot of what's called the G</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10881" target="_blank">03:01:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">loading. And so they've, they've tried to detach it from being an IQ proxy because IQ is such an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10885" target="_blank">03:01:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">inflammatory concept. And, and the consequence of that is, and this is sort of perverse, they've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10889" target="_blank">03:01:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">made it more coachable, right? So the IT for the SAT 40 years ago, coaching didn't really work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10895" target="_blank">03:01:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And more recently it has really started to work. And one of the things you see is that the Asian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10898" target="_blank">03:01:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">spike, you see this like giant leap upward in Asian performance over the last decade. And I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10902" target="_blank">03:01:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I think looking at the data, I think a lot of that is because it's more coachable now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10905" target="_blank">03:01:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and the, and the Asians do the most coaching. Um, so there's a bunch of issues with this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10910" target="_blank">03:01:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the coaching thing is really difficult because the coaching thing is a subsidy then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10914" target="_blank">03:01:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to the kids whose parents can afford coaching. Right. And I don't know about you, but where I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=10918" target="_blank">03:01:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">grew up, there was no SAT coaching. So there's like an issue there.

And so you can like literally like ask the code base questions about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11313" target="_blank">03:08:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">itself. Um, and you can also just do the simple form, which is you can copy and paste code into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11318" target="_blank">03:08:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a chat GPT and just ask it to explain it and what's going on, rewrite it, improve it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11321" target="_blank">03:08:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">make recommendations. And so there, there's, yeah, there's dozens of ways to, to, to do this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11326" target="_blank">03:08:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">by the way, you can also, I mean, even more broadly than code, like, okay, you want to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11330" target="_blank">03:08:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a video game. Okay. Now you can do AI art generation, sound generation, dialogue generation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11335" target="_blank">03:08:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">voice generation. Right. And so all of a sudden, like you don't need designers, you know, you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11339" target="_blank">03:08:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">need, um, you know, voice, uh, actors, you know, so yeah. So there's just like unlimited and then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11345" target="_blank">03:09:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, a big, is, you know, a big part of coding is so-called glue, you know, it's, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11348" target="_blank">03:09:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">interfacing into other systems. So it's interfacing into, you know, Stripe to take payments or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11352" target="_blank">03:09:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">something like that. And, you know, AI is fantastic at writing glue code. Um, so, you know, really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11357" target="_blank">03:09:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">really good at making sure that you can plug everything together.

Um, so it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11366" target="_blank">03:09:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">just this, it's like everything happening with AI right now. It's just, it's like this latent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11369" target="_blank">03:09:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">superpower.

And there's some gearing to whether you're a coder or not, but I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11383" target="_blank">03:09:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">there are lots of non-coders that are off to the races.

And this is maybe the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11401" target="_blank">03:10:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">most potent version of that that I've ever seen. Yeah. There's a, you know, the old meme with the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11407" target="_blank">03:10:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, with the bell curve, the, the, the people on both extremes say AI coding is the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11413" target="_blank">03:10:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, it's very common to programmers to say, you know, if you're any good of a programmer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11418" target="_blank">03:10:18.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you're not going to be using it. That's just, that's just not true. Now I consider myself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11423" target="_blank">03:10:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">reasonably good programmer and I, my productivity has been just skyrocketed and the joy of programming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11428" target="_blank">03:10:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">skyrocketed is every aspect of programming is more efficient, uh, more productive, more fun,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11436" target="_blank">03:10:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">all of that kind of stuff.

Like I think effectively there's unlimited demand for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11450" target="_blank">03:10:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">code.

Um, and so, and so like overwhelmingly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11461" target="_blank">03:11:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, the amount of code that exists in the world is a fraction of even the ideas we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11464" target="_blank">03:11:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">today. And then we come up with new ideas all the time. Um, and so I, I think that like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11468" target="_blank">03:11:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, I was, I was in the late eighties, early nineties when sort of automated coding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11473" target="_blank">03:11:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">systems started to come out, expert systems, big deal in those days. And there were all these,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11476" target="_blank">03:11:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">there was a famous book called the decline and fall of the American programmer, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11480" target="_blank">03:11:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the predicted that these new coding systems were going to mean we wouldn't have programmers in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11483" target="_blank">03:11:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the future.

They'll,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11495" target="_blank">03:11:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">they'll involve orchestrating AI.

Everybody's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11518" target="_blank">03:11:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to hire as many engineers as they can to build AI systems. It's just, uh, it's a hundred</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11522" target="_blank">03:12:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">percent. Uh, I mean there's, there's a handful of company, you know, there's a little bit, there's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11526" target="_blank">03:12:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a customer service, you know, there, we have some companies and others, uh, I think it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11530" target="_blank">03:12:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">clarinet that's publicizing a lot of this, um, in Europe. Um, uh, where, um, you know, they're,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11535" target="_blank">03:12:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">they're, you know, there are jobs that can be optimized, um, and jobs that can be automated,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11539" target="_blank">03:12:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but, um, like for engineering jobs, like it's just an explosion of hiring. Um, but at least so far,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11545" target="_blank">03:12:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">there's no trace of any sort of diminishing effect. Um, now having said that, I am looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11549" target="_blank">03:12:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">forward to the day. I am waiting for the first company to walk in saying yes. Um, like the more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11554" target="_blank">03:12:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">radical form of it. So basically the companies that we see are basically one of two kinds. We,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11558" target="_blank">03:12:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we see the companies that are basically sometimes use weak form, strong form. So the, the weak form</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11564" target="_blank">03:12:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">companies, I sometimes use the term, it's, it's the, it called the sixth bullet point. Um, AI is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11569" target="_blank">03:12:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the sixth bullet point on whatever they're doing. Sure. Right. And it's on the slide, right? So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11573" target="_blank">03:12:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">they've got the, you know, whatever, dot, dot, dot, dot, and then AI is the sixth thing. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11576" target="_blank">03:12:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the reason it has the sixth thing is because they had already previously written the slide before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11579" target="_blank">03:12:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the AI revolution started. And so they just added the sixth bullet point on the slide,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11581" target="_blank">03:13:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">which is how you're getting all these products that have like the AI button up in the corner,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11585" target="_blank">03:13:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">right? The little sparkly button. Yep. Right. Um, and all of a sudden Gmail is offering to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11589" target="_blank">03:13:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">summarize your email, which I'm like, I don't need that. Like I need, I need you to answer my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11594" target="_blank">03:13:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">email, not summarize it. Like what the hell? Okay. So we see those and that's fine. That's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11598" target="_blank">03:13:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know, putting sugar on the cake or something. Um, but then we see the strong</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11603" target="_blank">03:13:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">form, which is the companies that are building from scratch for AI, right? And they're, they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11607" target="_blank">03:13:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">building it. I actually just met with a company that is building literally an AI email system as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11610" target="_blank">03:13:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">an example. So just good. Oh, nice. I can't wait. Yeah. They're going to completely right. So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11615" target="_blank">03:13:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">very obvious idea of very smart team, um, you know, it's going to be great. You know, and then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11620" target="_blank">03:13:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, notion just, uh, you know, another, not one of our companies, but just came out with a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11623" target="_blank">03:13:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">product. So now companies are going to basically come through a sweep through and they're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11627" target="_blank">03:13:47.080</a></span> | <span class="t">do basically AI first versions of basically everything. And those are like companies built,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11631" target="_blank">03:13:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, AI is the first bullet point. It's the strong form of the argument. Yeah. Cursor is an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11635" target="_blank">03:13:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">example of that. They basically said, okay, we're going to rebuild the thing with AI as the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11640" target="_blank">03:14:00.840</a></span> | <span class="t">citizen. What if we knew from scratch that we could build on this? And, and, and, and again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11644" target="_blank">03:14:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">this is like, this is part of the full employment act for startups and VCs is it just like, if a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11649" target="_blank">03:14:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">if a technology transformation is sufficiently powerful, then you actually need to start the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11653" target="_blank">03:14:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">product development process over from scratch because you need to reconceptualize the product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11657" target="_blank">03:14:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then usually what that means is you need a new company because most incumbents just,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11661" target="_blank">03:14:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">just won't do that.

Um, and then we have the, we have this category of question we call the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11864" target="_blank">03:17:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">trillion dollar question, which is like literally depending on how it's answered, people make or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11868" target="_blank">03:17:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">lose a trillion dollars.

And so these are all just like, say this is an industry that's in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=11910" target="_blank">03:18:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">flux in a way that I even more dramatic, I think than the ones I've seen before.

So, and then there's a bunch of other,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12528" target="_blank">03:28:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, a bunch of new systems that are very exciting. So I think one of the things we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12531" target="_blank">03:28:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">look forward to in the next four years is number one, just like a massive reinvigoration of social</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12534" target="_blank">03:28:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">media as a consequence of the changes that are happening right now.

And then, um, I mean, it's happened on X, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12542" target="_blank">03:29:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not going to happen on other platforms. And then, um, the other is, um, crypto is going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12548" target="_blank">03:29:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">come, you know, crypto is going to come right back to life. Um, and actually that's very exciting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12552" target="_blank">03:29:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, that's worth noting is that's another trillion dollar question on AI, which is, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12555" target="_blank">03:29:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in a world of pervasive AI and especially in a world of AI agents and imagine a world of billions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12561" target="_blank">03:29:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or trillions of AI agents running around, they need an economy. Um, and in crypto, in our view,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12567" target="_blank">03:29:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">happens to be the ideal economic system for that, right?

It's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12571" target="_blank">03:29:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">very easy way to plug in and do that.

And so I think the crypto AI intersection, you know, is potentially very,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12579" target="_blank">03:29:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a very, very big deal.

Let</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12589" target="_blank">03:29:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">me ask, uh, a friend of yours, Yann LeCun, what are your top 10 favorite things about Yann LeCun?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12594" target="_blank">03:29:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">He's, uh, I think he's a, he's a brilliant guy.

Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12658" target="_blank">03:30:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and, um, and I actually, like, um, I, I try to do this thing where I try to model, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0&t=12663" target="_blank">03:31:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I try to have a mental model of like the two different sides of a serious argument.
