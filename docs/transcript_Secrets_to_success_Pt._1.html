Get an energy assist from SDG&E and SAFE. You may qualify for an 18% discount. Visit sdge.com/fera to find out more. - So if you wanna make six figures, you can't just be talking about you wanna make six figures. You hear what I'm saying to you tonight?</p><p>If you do the three things I tell you to do tonight, I guarantee you whatever it is you wanna do in life, you'll be able to do. You will be able to accomplish whatever you want to academically, financially, relationally, whatever. So three things. All right, now I'm gonna tell you this story.</p><p>I gotta get out of here. And the story is about, you guys have probably heard about this before. It was a young man who, you know, he wanted to make a lot of money and so he went to this guru, right? And he told the guru, you know, I wanna be on the same level you are.</p><p>And so the guru said, if you wanna be on the same level I'm on, I'll meet you tomorrow at the beach at 4 a.m. He like, the beach? I said, I wanna make money. I don't wanna swim. Guru said, if you wanna make money, I'll meet you tomorrow, 4 a.m.</p><p>So the young man got there at 4 a.m., he all ready to rock and roll, got on the suit, he should've wore shorts. The old man grabs his hand and said, how bad do you wanna be successful? He said, real bad. He said, walk on out in the water.</p><p>So he walks out into the water, watch this. When he walks out into the water, it goes waist deep. So he like, this guy crazy. Adrian, he like, I wanna make money. He got me out here swimming. I didn't ask to be a lifeguard. I wanna make money. He got me, so he said, come on a little further.</p><p>Walked out a little further. Then he had it right around this area, the shoulder area. So this old man crazy. He making money, but he crazy. Said, come on out a little further. Came out a little further, it was right at his mouth. My man like, I'm about to go back in here.</p><p>This guy, this is mine. So the old man said, I thought you said you wanted to be successful. He said, I do. He said, walk a little further. He came, dropped his head in, held him down, holding him down, my man getting scratchy, holding him down. I got you, I know you brushed it out, but I got you.</p><p>He had him held down. I need you for illustration. He had him held down just before my man was about to pass out, he raised him up. He said, I got a question for you. Somebody answer the question for me. He said, when you were underwater, what did you wanna do?</p><p>Lee, I'm looking for a different word though than lip. What's that word? He said, I wanted to breathe. He told the guy, he said, when you want to succeed as bad as you wanna breathe, then you'll be successful. I don't know how many of y'all got asthma in here today, but if you ever had an asthma attack before, you short of breath, SOB, shortness of breath, you wheezing, the only thing you trying to do is get some air.</p><p>You don't care about no basketball game. You don't care what's on TV. You don't care about nobody calling you. You don't care about a party. The only thing you care about when you're trying to breathe is to get some fresh air. That's it. And when you get to the point where all you wanna do is be successful as bad as you wanna breathe, then you'll be successful.</p><p>And I'm here to tell you, number one, that most of you say you wanna be successful, but you don't want it bad. You just kinda want it. You don't want it badder than you wanna party. You don't want it as much as you wanna be cool. Most of you don't want success as much as you wanna sleep.</p><p>Some of you love sleep more than you love success. And I'm here to tell you today, if you're going to be successful, you've gotta be willing to give up sleep. You gotta be willing to work off for three hours of sleep, two hours. If you really wanna be successful, some days you're gonna have to stay up three days in a row.</p><p>Because if you go to sleep, you might miss the opportunity to be successful. That's how bad you gotta want it. You gotta go days without, listen to me, you gotta wanna be successful so bad that you forget to eat. Beyonce said once she was on the set doing her thing, three days had gone by, she forgot she didn't eat.</p><p>'Cause she was engaged. I'll never forget when 50 Cent was doing his movie, I did a little research on 50, and 50 said that when he wasn't doing the movie, he was doing the soundtrack. And they said, "When do you sleep, 50?" Sleep, he said, "Sleep is for those people who are broke." I don't sleep.</p><p>He said, "I got an opportunity "to make a dream become a reality." Football players, how many football players, got anybody like football in here, raise your hand. Anybody like football? Emmitt Smith, I used to be a Cowboy fan before they did my boy Tom Landry wrong. I used to be a Cowboy fan.</p><p>And watch this, there was a commercial. Emmitt Smith had won his first Super Bowl, and he had this commercial when he was lifting weights. I don't know if you saw the commercial, and he was lifting, and he said, "Emmitt said, you know what, I won the Super Bowl, "so I can rest now." He was doing this bench press.</p><p>So he said, "I won the Super Bowl, so I can rest now." So he throws up about 325, boom, and he rests for about two seconds. Then he, boom, boom, boom. Did you see that? He'd already won a Super Bowl. He said, "I think I'm gonna take a rest." And he rests for how long?</p><p>One second. Most of you won't be successful, because when you're studying, and you get tired, you quit. And I'm here to tell you today, if you gotta, somebody came to my office the other day crying. I said, "Look, don't cry to give up. "Cry to keep going. "Don't cry to quit.</p><p>"You already in pain, you already hurt. "Get a reward from it. "Don't go to sleep until you succeed." Listen to me, I'm here to tell you today that you can come here, you can jump up, you can do flips, you can be excited when we give away money, but listen to me, you'll never be successful until I don't have to give you a dime to do what you do.</p><p>(audience murmuring) You won't be successful until you say, "I don't need that money, 'cause I got it in here." So listen to me, Emmitt Smith said this at the end of the commercial. Emmitt Smith said, "All men are created equal. "Some work harder in pre-season." I'm gonna say it again, because you might've missed it.</p><p>All men are created equal, some work harder in pre-season. So that means that there are some people who are going to see the professor, going to see the TA, and even when the professor says, "I don't meet with you, my TA meets with you," you say, "I don't wanna talk to your TA." - That's what it is.</p><p>- I don't pay the TA. - That's right. - I pay you to teach me. So you're gonna have to find some time to meet me. If I gotta meet you at the mall, if I gotta meet you at your house, you are going to see me. Listen to me, all men are created equal, some work harder in pre-season.</p><p>When I went to college, guys were way smarter than me. 4.0s, 3.0s, they went to the Ivy League high schools, came to Oakwood from these great high schools. Most of them are not doing what I'm doing, why? 'Cause it's not about where you come from, it's about heart. You come to a place where being smart ain't enough, you gotta have heart, that's number one.</p><p>Watch number two, number two, catch number two, I wrote it down, I wanted to make sure you got it. It says, watch this, watch this, we're talking about sacrifice now. The important thing is this, you're writing why I'm saying it, 'cause I only have about three more minutes, listen to me.</p><p>The most important thing is this, to be able at any moment to sacrifice what you are for what you will become. That's the number two thing, you gotta catch that one. To be able to, listen to me, at any moment, some of you, you can make sacrifices when Monday night football is not on, you can make a sacrifice, but when the game come on, for some reason, you just attached to it.</p><p>For some of you, when your favorite show come on, you can make sacrifices on Sunday when ain't nothing going on but when your favorite show comes on Monday, bam, some of you, you focus into the phone ring and then you like, I gotta answer it. If I don't answer the phone, I'm gonna die.</p><p>I'm saying to you today that there are some of you, if you give up your cell phone, you would be successful but your cell phone is more important to you than your success. I'm gonna say it again, I'm gonna hurt somebody, I'm gonna hurt somebody. Some of you need to give up your cell phone because the time you spend on your cell phone could be used for your success.</p><p>The time you could be using to be successful, you're using it on the cell and the cell phone is not bringing you nothing but a bill and somebody has told you, you couldn't live without it. I'm talking about going deep now, giving up stuff. Watch what it says. To be able at any moment to sacrifice what we are for what we could be.</p><p>I don't do well in math, you're right. You ain't never studied. I'm not good in writing 'cause you have never written before but I dare you to fail in writing for a whole year to see if you can get to the end. I dare you to fail. I dare you to take that same class over and over again.</p><p>I dare you to stop dropping classes like you soft. Always wanna give up, I'm dropping. Why you dropping? I'm so grateful that the slaves didn't drop and quit. I'm saying I'm just gonna stop. I'm a slave, I'm just gonna be a slave, I'm gonna quit. Listen to me, the slaves said, we will live because one day we will become.</p><p>- Don't just dream about paradise, live it with Fiji Airways.
