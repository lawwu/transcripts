Twitter from OpenAI senior staff saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">"OpenAI is nothing without its people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It seems like the original OpenAI is imploding in real time, and for some it's gotten personal."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.700</a></span> | <span class="t">One research scientist at OpenAI said "Ilya does not care about safety or humanity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is just ego and power-hungriness that backfired."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the last few moments, we learn that Ilya Sutskova himself regrets what happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">He says "I love everything we've built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And at 5.30am his time, after presumably not having slept at all, Sam Altman hearted that comment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Who knows what will come of that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But with perhaps 10 crazy revelations to get to, I'm not going to spend too much time on the Twitter wars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because first and foremost, we have a new AGI lab within Microsoft.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Sam Altman is going to be the CEO of this new group and Greg Brockman is joining him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course, with what we've seen on Twitter, it looks like hundreds of OpenAI former employees might be joining them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The group doesn't even have a name yet, but with Microsoft's compute, they look set to become one of the major AGI players.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And the CEO of Microsoft has already confirmed that Microsoft will quickly provide this new group with the resources needed for their success.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course, OpenAI aren't yet dead and I'll get to their new CEO in a moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But first, we have a bit more info about what led to this monumental split.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">A key division arose between the visions of Ilya Sutskova, the chief scientist of OpenAI, and Sam Altman, the CEO.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">In October, Sam Altman moved to reduce Sutskova's role at the company, which obviously infuriated him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Then, according to Bloomberg, there were announcements at Dev Day that further angered Sutskova.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Apparently, the safety team really didn't like the customized versions of ChatGPT that allowed anyone to create chatbots.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And particularly, they didn't like the idea of those chatbots becoming autonomous agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But the rift goes further back even than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This exclusive extract from a book was released in The Atlantic in the last few minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Apparently, the November release last year of ChatGPT caused a rift inside the company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">One faction felt the company and indeed the world wasn't ready.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The extract says this strained the already tense relationship between OpenAI's factions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">which Altman referred to in 2019 as the different tribes within the company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The success of ChatGPT caught the company by surprise and computing power from research teams was redirected to handle the flow of traffic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">The servers kept crashing and safety teams within the company pushed to slow things down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.500</a></span> | <span class="t">When GPT-4 was launched, apparently customers tried to take advantage of the $20 free credit offered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what happened was that employees from the already small trust and safety staff were reassigned from other abuse areas to focus on that fraud issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Some employees in the safety team struggled with mental health issues and communication was poor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">In an ironic twist, co-workers would find out that colleagues had been fired only after noticing them disappear on Slack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But according to this book, what also started to happen was that Ilya Sutskova began to behave a bit like a spiritual leader.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">His constant enthusiastic refrain was to "feel the AGI".</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And at one of their holiday parties, Sutskova led employees in a chant "feel the AGI, feel the AGI".</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the last few minutes, we learn that Ilya Sutskova was using that question, "do you feel the AGI" in job interviews.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">This researcher, Adam Roberts, ended up at Google DeepMind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And it only gets weirder from here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Apparently, Sutskova commissioned a wooden effigy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">That's like a miniature statue, and that was intended to represent an unaligned AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">He then set that effigy on fire to symbolize OpenAI's commitment to its founding principles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Then things seem to have come to a head when Sam Altman began to fundraise for a billion dollar new chip venture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.300</a></span> | <span class="t">That was apparently codenamed Tigris, which is a major river flowing through the Middle East.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">He wanted an AI focused chip to compete against NVIDIA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There are strong hints that Sam Altman not being candid about this activity could have been the proximate cause of the firing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway, I've covered the 15 minute firing in my previous video, but now for an hour by hour account of what happened after that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the first thing that happened was that the CEO of Microsoft, which don't forget has invested 13 billion into OpenAI, was apparently livid at the announcement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember, he was blindsided and only given a minute's notice of the firing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">For Nadella, don't forget, OpenAI and GPT-4 was his way, and I quote, of making Google dance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And that investment seemed to be crumbling before the shock move that he made next.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But back to the moments after the firing, the pressure from Microsoft and other investors caused the board to even consider resigning themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Apparently, Sam Altman and Greg Brockman wouldn't return with the current board in place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">At this point, it looked like there would be a complete reversal with the board and Satskava going and Sam Altman returning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Even the interim CEO, Mira Murati, apparently was asking Sam Altman and Greg Brockman to come back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">That's around the time we got the tweet from Sam Altman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I love the OpenAI team so much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">That got 29 million impressions and caused hundreds of OpenAI staff to retweet hearts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything looks set for his return.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Sam Altman even physically went back to the OpenAI offices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But remember, his account had been locked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">He had no access to his pass or his emails.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So this was him with a guest pass.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And his not so subtle message to investors and the board was, you don't have long to persuade me to come back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the first and last time I'll ever wear one of these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But he may have pushed too far because what he wanted was not only the removal of existing board members, including Ilya Satskava,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">but also a statement absolving him of wrongdoing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyakih3oYpk&t=382"
