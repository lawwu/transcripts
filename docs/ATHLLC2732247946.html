So I would encourage you to just try to focus more on vegetables.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1466" target="_blank">00:24:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's funny, you can even eat a pretty rich salad. But if you're eating a salad, you're going to, I find no matter what, I like find myself losing weight if I just focus on eating more vegetables.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1477" target="_blank">00:24:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But you know, it's just one of those things. It's like, okay, if you've gained a little weight, because of COVID or whatever, and you notice you've maybe been eating a little more ice cream or whatever, I would say don't, yes, like, so an obvious thing you can do is eat less ice cream, right? Like, that's, that's an obvious thing, or pizza or whatever your little indulgence is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1494" target="_blank">00:24:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But and I don't want you to say you can't have it, but just try to like, be more mindful of how often you're doing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1500" target="_blank">00:25:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">If you if it's come to the point where you're doing it two or three times a week, like, cut down to one. Like, so it's not zero. And I maybe it's even every other week, I don't know, like, and then watch your body and listen to your body. Like, I, there's no right answer here. And maybe for you, like, you're like, no way in hell, I'm giving up my ice cream, but like, I don't really need that toast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1517" target="_blank">00:25:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So you you pick what matters to you, and be mindful of both quality and quantity. And just kind of keep tabs on those things. I mean, if you're just if you just sit down at any meal and kind of eat whatever's in front of you, it's going to be really hard. But you do have to sort of think and plan, like, how am I going to because you want to eat enough healthy food that you feel good to when you have energy, and you're not tired.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1538" target="_blank">00:25:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So you sort of have to think about your life and think about what you're doing and how much energy you need and what your weight goals are and what your health goals goals are and, and taper. I think the biggest one of the biggest things people do is they go they go like, all in on one thing crazy. And I just I don't think that's a recipe for long term success.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1555" target="_blank">00:25:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, we've been very happy with meal planning and kind of mapping out. Okay, these are the things we're going to do this week. Let's buy the groceries that make this possible. And we end up not bringing home as many things that like, like, it's almost hard to fall into a bad situation if you don't have it in your house. And if you've made a plan, but if five o'clock rolls around, and you're like, Oh, my gosh, what is the plan for dinner? We haven't prepared anything. I feel like I would just fall into a panic mode where I'm like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1581" target="_blank">00:26:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">take out Thai food, of course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1583" target="_blank">00:26:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, of course. That's delicious. But yeah, what about when you're out and about and you're ordering carry out or at a restaurant? Is it just a disaster? Are there ways to make it better?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1593" target="_blank">00:26:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, great question. So yeah, if I find myself at sort of a mid range restaurant where I think the food's going to be all right, like nothing that I is particularly special, but I need to get some food in my body, I will definitely be super careful to make sure I order a lot of vegetables. So even if it means ordering a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1611" target="_blank">00:26:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">extra and spending an extra like six bucks on the appetizer, that's a lot of vegetables, I always do that I make sure I eat it. And then I try to be mindful of what I'm ordering. I avoid words like glazed, crispy, because it's really easy to get tricked into eating like 2000 calories in one meal at a restaurant like that, if you're not careful. And if it's not an amazing place that you're like, this is a once in a lifetime thing. I've been saving up for this for three months, you know, that's not really worth it to have something really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1641" target="_blank">00:27:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">bad for you. So I try to make meals like that as healthy as I can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1644" target="_blank">00:27:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">My trick is, I find that if I'm at a restaurant, I'm looking at the menu, I end up on like, the thing that's probably glazed and crispy. But I'll look at the menu at home, like maybe right after I had breakfast, and I'm not even hungry. And I'm like, you know what, when I go to this restaurant, I'm going to order this chicken salad, right? And I'll decide what I want before I go. And it makes it so easy. I get there. And I'm like, I don't even need to look at the menu. I know what I'm going to order. I don't need to get distracted. And I kind of plan</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1671" target="_blank">00:27:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that in advance. It sounds a little ridiculous. Maybe a couple drinks in I might change my mind if it's if it's one of those dinners, but that's been really helpful for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1679" target="_blank">00:27:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's brilliant, actually. And the more you can plan in advance and make decisions before you get hungry, the more you're gonna win. Yeah, because you may nobody who's hungry makes a good decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1689" target="_blank">00:28:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And that I assume that's also true at the grocery store.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1692" target="_blank">00:28:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely.

And it had me thinking, gosh, sometimes after dinner, I just want something sweet to finish the meal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1722" target="_blank">00:28:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, man, if I just had that, that would that would substitute any other thing. But instead, our au pair loves Oreos. And I was like, instead, I have no dark chocolate. I just have a box of Oreos. And both would have been fine. But I only had one of them. And so I made the wrong decision. Or I made the only decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1742" target="_blank">00:29:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But it sounds like you analyzed it and you figured out why.

Are there other things for people who have that sweet tooth, which I would say I fall into a trap of less self control around a batch of freshly baked cookies or walking by or in a donut store? Like, what are ways to either kind of get over that desire or sweet tooth? Let's start there. And then I'm also curious if there are things that kind of fill that void that are better choices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1774" target="_blank">00:29:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so what? One thing that I found to be very true is the less you eat it, the more you crave it. So I used to consider myself a sweet tooth. And I always had to have something up to do, especially if I had a lot of garlic, for some reason, five garlic breath, even if I brush my teeth, I kind of just like want some sugar. But that has just faded and faded and faded over time. And it's a lot less desirable to me now, which is fantastic. So that's one thing to consider. The other thing is that there's dark chocolate is fantastic. I like sometimes it's, it's kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1803" target="_blank">00:30:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">calorie rich, but it's not I wouldn't say it's bad for you. But I like dark chocolate with a scoop of peanut butter on it. And that's good. But I'm also I have like, so I'm a weirdo, like I said, I don't like that much sugar these days. But I do one of my like, biggest indulgences that I'm a little bit embarrassed about, is I pay a sort of ridiculous amount of money to get fruit shipped from California to my house in Oregon. Because it's so good. It is just so freaking good. These, these plots, they're called Flavor King plots.

But I think 20% of her desire to move to California was the fresh fruit, and like pluot specifically. So I think I think you would you would enjoy time together enjoying fresh fruit here. You talked about the the group of people that actually were able to to keep weight down and naturally, and they had a lot of habits. Are there habits that you think people can adopt to start to make this easier, both eating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1892" target="_blank">00:31:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">healthy, and just kind of living a more intentional lifestyle?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1895" target="_blank">00:31:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a good question. So there's two big pieces. One is around movement, and one is around food. Right? So with movement, I there's this thing, formal exercise is fantastic. Like if you enjoy it, that's great. And you know, I do think people should do it. I think that no matter what your health status, everybody should do a little bit of cardio, a few times a week and do some strength training just for aging. I mean, you're just not going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1922" target="_blank">00:32:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">get a better bang for your buck for staying alive and and mobile into until old age. And and it is like an amazing it like it helps you sleep amazing surface source of endorphins. But the amount of energy that you can use, just doing normal daily life stuff, people massively underrate that. So people tend to have a habits of like taking the elevator, sitting on a bench when waiting for something like I would just encourage people to start looking at those as opportunities to move and be active.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1951" target="_blank">00:32:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I almost never sit if I'm waiting at a doctor's office, like also I'm the one standing. What's much easier now with COVID? Because I'm like, Oh, I'm gonna get a disease if I sit there. So I'm not going to touch anything. But um, you know, maybe we all have a little bit more of these habits now. But just just try to be thoughtful about just try to be active and get your kids involved to get whatever, like, well, it's like recruiting people actually like moving people forget that but moving actually feels really good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=1974" target="_blank">00:32:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Before you go to the next one, with regard to COVID, I feel like video meetings have taken over. And now there's constantly meetings that could be phone calls probably were phone calls in 2019. And now they're all video meetings. And as much as I enjoy getting to connect with people's faces on a screen, I feel like I've lost a lot of the ability to take a walking call, or a walking in person meeting. And so I've been pushing back, someone's like, Oh, here's the video call. And I'm like, actually, let's do this as a phone call, and go on a walk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2004" target="_blank">00:33:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's been hard during COVID. Because everyone wants to meet on zoom or Skype or something. And so I'd say, if you don't feel like you get enough time to do that anymore, just push back, say, Hey, we don't need to do this on a video call, let's do a phone call, or just most of these have ability to dial in, I'll just dial in and say, Hey, you don't need to turn your video on. I'm just here on the phone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2023" target="_blank">00:33:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Totally. Yeah, Kevin's been doing that, too. My husband.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2026" target="_blank">00:33:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so movement, and?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2029" target="_blank">00:33:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so on the food front, like I said, the first thing I recommend to people is eat more, eat more vegetables. Like it's so much easier than a don't, don't, don't, don't. I mean, if you don't know how to cook, it's one of the the number one skills you can develop in life. And I would say start small, and pick pick a meal, maybe breakfast is easy. Maybe start with breakfast or figure out ways to cook. I say having a schedule around the grocery store is really important to like working that into figuring out when that's going to happen, what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2059" target="_blank">00:34:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">going to look like, I'll rearrange my whole week to make sure that the produce I get is good. Because like I was saying earlier, I want to love what I eat. And even if it's just my Tuesday night dinner, and so I will go out of my way to make sure that the salad mix I get is delightful, or that the the carrots I'm going to cook for my kids are sweet and tasty, so they actually want to eat them. So it's not something that we have to fight over is something they love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2084" target="_blank">00:34:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for me, I spend a little extra time, energy and money on finding the best foods, and make sure that like, that's not a negotiable on my day. Like everybody knows, like, I can't take meetings on Tuesdays in the afternoon, because I am grocery shopping. So there's just things like that are really helpful. And I'd say finally, when you are thinking about removing things, like, again, try not to build into that your your self talk anything about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2113" target="_blank">00:35:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">moralizing food as good or bad, and try to acknowledge what your body wants when it wants something a little sweet, or wants to have some of your like mom's famous chocolate chip cookies or whatever it like those things have value, don't feel bad about it, just kind of be more aware and know that you can't do that every day, but that you're not like bad for doing it, or that it's okay to like it. It's okay to love cookies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2138" target="_blank">00:35:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I am. I'm okay that I love cookies. And one thing you mentioned about learning to cook. I was doing some research before this. Am I right that you have a course for learning to cook?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I do. So this is something that comes up a lot. And it's hard to cook. And I, I the reason I think it's hard to cook is because cooking isn't one skill. It's a set of like eight skills. There's knife skills, there's flavor pairing skills, there's heat learning skills. And I taught myself. And I know it wasn't that hard. And I had so many people telling me it was too hard. And like, it's not that hard. And so I just put this program together. It's a 30 day program to teach people to cook without recipes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2180" target="_blank">00:36:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Because when I started interviewing people about why they don't cook, they would just give me these stories about how they go to the grocery store with a list trying to make all these recipes, they get home, but you know, they only use half an onion and like two carrots out of the entire bunch. And they make the food and because they don't really know how to cook, maybe they didn't quite season it right. Or maybe they cut the carrot chunks too big. And so it didn't quite turn out as well as they want. So they have all this food because they made a batch for like six people. It's not that good. Nobody wants to eat it. There's a bunch of leftovers in the fridge that go bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2211" target="_blank">00:36:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then the rest of their groceries that they didn't use in the recipes go bad. And they're like, miserable. They're like, why did I do this? I spent all this time all this money, it didn't turn out good. And it's a waste. And they just end up getting pizza anyway. So I realized after talking to the people who do cook, and the people who don't cook is the biggest difference was how much they rely on recipes as like a day to day cooking thing. It's like, yeah, almost everybody will use a recipe for a bigger, more elaborate meal. But people who cook a lot can throw stuff together with whatever's in their fridge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2240" target="_blank">00:37:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I wanted to teach people that skill, because that's how I cook. And I just the first thing I do if I'm like, what's for dinner, and I don't know, I look in my fridge and see what's there. It's like, and I like I can start being the conductor of the orchestra of how this is all going to come together in my belly later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2251" target="_blank">00:37:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And so is that do you think that's something easy to learn? It sounds hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2256" target="_blank">00:37:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you can learn it in 30 days. Okay. Yeah, it's called food is kitchen, by the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2261" target="_blank">00:37:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2262" target="_blank">00:37:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">foodiskitchen.com.

So one thing that I feel like I regret, and maybe I'm overemphasizing it is that I grew up in a clean plate club household. And I feel like it's been really hard, if not, you know, almost impossible to break the habit of always eat everything that's in front of you. I assume that's a pretty bad habit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2290" target="_blank">00:38:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Any, any reactions or thoughts on on people who kind of grew up in that household and have that kind of ingrained in their style of eating?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2297" target="_blank">00:38:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I will 100% say that habits that you develop, like under the age of 10 are really, really hard to break. Because they're, they're pretty ingrained in who you are, and your identity. So I don't blame you for that being challenging. I would say, I mean, there's a couple ways you can solve this, right? One is get smaller plates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2317" target="_blank">00:38:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, another one is, you could start a mindful eating practice. So when you're eating, to finish your plate, you're on autopilot, right? You're telling me that the cue to stop eating is that your plates empty. So that just means you're not, you're not focused on other goals. One thing you can do is you can train yourself to really focus on the food in your mouth and the bite you're taking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2344" target="_blank">00:39:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And I mean, the way I do this is I practice it was so so hard. This is the single hardest food habit I I developed. But I knew I needed it because I would eat really fast. I grew up with two brothers. So I didn't it wasn't like necessarily a clean plate thing. But it was just like, we all just like ate like maniacs. And like, it's amazing. We didn't choke or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2363" target="_blank">00:39:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But so and when my husband eats really fast, and I'm like, triggered by his eating fast, I have to like, be like, dude, slow down. You're like, making me nervous. But now I have learned to do this slowly. And the way I did it was I trained myself with one meal a day. And I would just go through and just like, do one meal when I was basically eating with my eyes closed, not entirely closed. But when the foods in my mouth, my eyes closed, no devices, no computers, no sounds and just focus on my food.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2393" target="_blank">00:39:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And once you develop that skill, then it, it gets easier to transfer it to something like a dinner out with friends, you just start naturally stopping eating when you're full. But it's a lot of practice. It's hard work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2405" target="_blank">00:40:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be. I get it. Life comes at you fast. But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang. So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event. Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2426" target="_blank">00:40:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together. It doesn't even have to be a good one. It could be your dog's birthday that the sun finally came out. Or maybe you just want to celebrate that you got through another week. With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to do list, which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2448" target="_blank">00:40:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores. So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store. So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com. That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.

Is it that it will slow you down and that will make you realize you're full? Or how does that work in your brain?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2509" target="_blank">00:41:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Both. So I mean, one of the biggest things you'd be surprised to hear, people don't chew. So like, you know, when you're like a fast eater and you're like getting to the bottom of your plate, like, my guess is you're chewing food probably like 20% as much as you should. So that 100% you will not feel as full as quickly. And you will also probably get more stomach aches if you chew more. And it basically it takes you out of the autopilot. So you can actually start making decisions about when what you want to eat and when you're going to eat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2538" target="_blank">00:42:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you want to stop that's conscious instead of unconscious. I have a course for that too, by the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2545" target="_blank">00:42:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">A course on learning to mindfully mindful eating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2548" target="_blank">00:42:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's free. It's called mindful meal challenge. And it's a five day free program that takes you through like how to tackle that one meal. And there's like sort of five different things you can try. And I love that. I love that program. And I'm very proud of that one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2564" target="_blank">00:42:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm coming back to some of the kind of habits and ways to get going. And I know you've you've talked in the past and thought a lot about habits, habit creation rewards, are there things that someone who's trying to really incorporate more vegetables trying to eat more real foods and kind of be more intentional about what they're eating? Are there ways to make that easier to become a habit and part of your new lifestyle?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2590" target="_blank">00:43:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I mean, the easiest thing to do is work with your brain instead of against it. So we kind of touched on this a little bit earlier when you're talking about when we're talking about moralizing food choices. But when it comes to motivation, especially for things like health, where it's just day to day for the rest of your life, it's not like if you have to just study for a final or something, or like prep for a podcast, you use willpower, you force yourself to work, you hit your goal, and you're done. But that's this is a very different type of activity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2619" target="_blank">00:43:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And the most important thing for activities like that, in habits that you want to build is that your motivation needs to be intrinsic. So you need to truly enjoy what you're doing for the sake of itself. So I absolutely encourage people not to think of rewards as being outside the food, like if I cook myself dinner, then I can eat dessert, that's an extrinsic motivation, and it can actually undermine your intrinsic motivation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2643" target="_blank">00:44:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of science here. But just try to believe me on this one that when you tell yourself you have to do things for a prize, it makes the thing you're doing less, less enjoyable, for a lot of reasons. And so for food, that's why I'm constantly harping on seasonality, farmers markets cooking for yourself, because one of the things that happens when you can cook for yourself is you can actually make food that you like to eat. And that's huge. Because if you like to eat something more, like I like my food cooking more than the vast majority of restaurants in probably any city I've lived in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2673" target="_blank">00:44:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's amazing, right? Like I'm I didn't I didn't start out as some like, amazing chef, but I just I know what I like to eat. And I'm now I'm pretty good at it. And I think that you really can't underestimate how much energy you need to spend making sure that that is what you dial that in on your habits. Because if you're trying to like force yourself to do something, then it's not a habit. A habit is automatic. And the only way it becomes automatic is if it's reinforced with intrinsic reward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2699" target="_blank">00:44:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, you mentioned, of course, you enjoy the food more than restaurants. And earlier, you started talking about how you're willing to spend a little bit more for food. But I just want to throw out there like, if you're spending a little bit more on ingredients, but making it at home, net net, it's probably still way less expensive than going way less expensive, way less expensive. I mean, this was like my probably my number one hack for grad school was learning to cook, because I was so broke. And I'm such a food snob. Like, it was like, literally, I had no other choice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2727" target="_blank">00:45:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I just I was like, I have to figure out how to cook. Otherwise, I'm gonna like eat myself into bankruptcy at these like fancy restaurants in San Francisco, because I just I discovered those restaurants and I couldn't afford to eat there. But I, I just I needed I needed good food. So yeah, I just got really good at cooking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2743" target="_blank">00:45:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I know you said get past the recipes eventually. And that's good. And there's a course for it. But are there a few kind of like, easy, healthy meals, someone listening to this could say, you know what, give me something to make this week that I could try and I might really enjoy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2756" target="_blank">00:45:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, my God, I'm gonna give you the best recipe right now. I'm so excited for you. Okay, get ahead of cauliflower, fresh as possible, break it up, throw it in a bowl, dose it with a solid amount of olive oil and a solid amount of salt. Make the pieces as close to evenly sized as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2772" target="_blank">00:46:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Heat your oven to 500 or 475. If you have convection, go 475. And put the cauliflower on a baking sheet, make sure it's Oh, you know what, I like to add curry powder to you don't have to, but there's some curry powder on there. It's really good on the cauliflower, get get it kind of orange. And then separate it out on a baking sheet, make sure there's like enough space on the baking sheet, so it's not crowded. And then foil over it, stick it in the oven, set your timer for 15 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2801" target="_blank">00:46:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Take it out, what will happen is it'll steam a teeny bit inside there, and it'll start to look a little bit translucent. Take the foil off. Sometimes I reduce the heat a little bit more like by 25 degrees, stir it up and stick it back in the oven, set your timer for eight minutes this time. And then keep checking it and stirring it every eight minutes until it's brown and crispy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2820" target="_blank">00:47:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, my kids, like, I could feed them that every meal for every day and they would eat it like they love it. Everybody loves it. It kind of tastes like cauliflower french fries. I don't know, it's by far my most popular recipe. And everybody I've made it for absolutely loves it. So give that a try. Super easy, super healthy. And the one thing you'll realize is that you wish you bought more cauliflower. Get a big one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2841" target="_blank">00:47:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Wow. Okay, so I'm gonna get this recipe. We're gonna type it up and put it in the show notes for anyone who wants to make it. I'll probably make it this weekend. And I'm excited. It sounds wonderful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2852" target="_blank">00:47:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I can send you a link. And there are tons of other recipes over at Summer Tomato. There's a huge recipe section. Yeah. Oh, I was gonna tell you one more thing. You asked me about some hacks for cooking. One of the things that people mistake a lot. So with meat, if you're cooking meat, take it out of the fridge like an hour before you cook it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2868" target="_blank">00:47:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Like cooking cold meat is like a really fantastic way to make it tough. And if you can, even better it'd be salted the night before. And then like, that's like probably the number one hack for cooking chicken. Just like give it a good rub of salt, probably a little more salt than you think you need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2883" target="_blank">00:48:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Coat it all over, let it sit overnight in the fridge, pull it out an hour before you want to cook it and then cook it. Your mind will be blown how much different it tastes. And is this true all meats? Pretty much. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I mean, maybe not fish, but that's amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2897" target="_blank">00:48:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So you've mentioned your kids a few times. How have you started to apply these lessons to your kids? And I think we probably both grew up at a time where what you eat as a kid is kind of very different, hopefully, than what the kids eat today. But do they love vegetables? Because, you know, most kids don't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2915" target="_blank">00:48:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So this is the main thing I think about these days. And yeah, my kids are amazing eaters. They have this tree stump down in the yard. And they call it their fairy house. And they like go down there and they're like, we're going to cook for the fairies. We're going to make the fairies kale and lentils because they love kale and lentils. And Zelda, my oldest, she says that onions are her first favorite food. And kale is her second favorite food. And cauliflower is definitely up there somewhere too. Yeah, no, they're fantastic eaters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2943" target="_blank">00:49:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, it was not always. It's been a journey for sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2949" target="_blank">00:49:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Any tricks for getting them to like these foods, especially for people whose kids right now kind of sneer at the idea of eating vegetables?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2958" target="_blank">00:49:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so a few things. I mean, make sure it tastes good. I mean, one thing I find that parents will often just sort of steam vegetables in the microwave or something and like barely put any salt or oil. It's like, would you want to eat that? Like make food you'd want to eat. Add garlic, add salt. My kids love flavor. I don't know. There's some rumor that started that kids need to start with bland food. If you give your kids bland food, they're going to be used to and expect bland food. And then when you give them flavor, they're going to freak out and think it's weird.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2984" target="_blank">00:49:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So I recommend starting with flavor as early as you can and cook things in different ways if they reject something, which totally happens. Or like most kids, I mean, they're good eaters until they're two and then they get and they'll start rejecting things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=2996" target="_blank">00:49:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, just be persistent. Kids need to try something sometimes up to 20 times before they'll truly accept it. So what I'll do is I'll cook things in different ways. I'll use different spices. I'll roast versus saute if they didn't like the saute last time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3010" target="_blank">00:50:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I just I don't fight with them over it. But, you know, I do expect them to take a few bites and they'll usually do that. It's not it's never a battle. I mean, at one point, Zelda would her limited vegetables, her vegetables were limited to cauliflower and kale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3025" target="_blank">00:50:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I mean, she would sometimes eat broccoli, but like not really. But she was pretty difficult. She wouldn't eat anything orange. And she's I mean, I'm not 100 percent there with everything yet, but she now loves carrots, like loves broccoli, like everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3038" target="_blank">00:50:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">She just really, really loves it. And it just took persistence and just making sure that the food tastes good and having them keep trying. And sometimes I wait a few months and try again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3047" target="_blank">00:50:47.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, we someone gave us that tip with toys. They were like, Oh, if there's a toy that someone's that your daughter's not interested in, just hide it for a couple months and bring it back. Like memory is not so well formed yet that two months later, they probably think it's a brand new toy and they're excited to see it again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3062" target="_blank">00:51:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So toys, toy rotating is key, for sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3066" target="_blank">00:51:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Okay, so a couple quick hits. I want to I want to ask, what are your thoughts on skipping meals or intermittent fasting as as part of the the food lifestyle?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3077" target="_blank">00:51:17.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Really good question. So my initial thought is a lot of the data that was done on intermittent fasting, we're pretty short fasts, like 13 to 14 hours, which is a pretty reasonable amount of time to go from dinner to breakfast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3090" target="_blank">00:51:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So in that realm, like, I think you're fine, like, you don't really get hungry in 13, 14 hours. And there's a lot of, like potential benefits from that. So I think that's pretty reasonable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3101" target="_blank">00:51:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">When you start getting in a longer fast, 16, 18, 24, multi day fast, it gets a little trickier. I would say that for certain populations, it's amazing. For instance, it's been shown to really, really help with cancer, like chemotherapy, as our friends, Mike Mazur, had a really excellent result with his chemotherapy, because he was doing a lot of fasting at the same time. And there's tons of science supporting this now, it's really awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3128" target="_blank">00:52:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So in certain populations, I think longer fast can be extremely beneficial. But I for most people, it can be a little risky, I'd say for a couple reasons. One, if you've been in a chronic dieter at all, it can really lead to some binging behavior. And I would generally recommend anybody who has a history of dieting to avoid long fasting. I don't I think there's better ways to get those same results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3153" target="_blank">00:52:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I would also say that you have to be really careful with fasting because a lot of the recent data that's coming out is showing that extended fasting can really, really reduce muscle mass dramatically. So if you are going to be fasting is really, really important that when you do eat, you eat a good amount of protein and you do a lot of strength training exercises. Otherwise, you can really mess up your metabolism and lose a lot of muscle mass. So those are some things to be cautious about in that realm. Otherwise, whatever, whatever works for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3183" target="_blank">00:53:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And what about kind of timing your eating? Is it important to follow a schedule or circadian rhythm? Or people always talk about how just grazing is a bad habit? Is it is that less important if you're grazing on good things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3197" target="_blank">00:53:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">My goodness, I think you're the first non scientist to ever ask me about circadian rhythms. That's amazing. I'm so proud of you. Yeah, no, circadian rhythms are really, really, really important. I think they're underestimated by most people. And the more you are on a schedule, the easier your life's going to be for like a lot of things, especially kids. I mean, kids are like, so on that train, like, I don't, we're on a really tight schedule with the kids. But for myself, personally, even I, if you, your body and your mind know what to expect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3228" target="_blank">00:53:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and they can regulate their hormones in a way to prepare you for that. And if you're eating all over the place, your body is going to be confused. And it's going to be a lot harder. So yes, generally, if you can, I highly recommend sticking to a schedule, it's going to be super helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3241" target="_blank">00:54:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So just to wrap up a couple last things. If someone were out there saying, I want to get started. Obviously, you said earlier, don't just jump all the way and maybe start with a meal. Any other tips for someone who's trying to transition from maybe a less healthy style?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3255" target="_blank">00:54:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I would say just start with one or two habits at a time. Don't don't go too crazy. I mean, when it was me. So basically, what I did was, I mean, I was like, dieting all the time, I was running marathons, I was doing all this stuff. I was working out for like, two hours a day, I was just a crazy person. And I just one day, I was like, I'm going to stop doing this, I'm going to stop being crazy. And I'm going to start eating breakfast. And so I started with breakfast. And I hadn't eaten carbs in like seven years or something. But I ate oatmeal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3285" target="_blank">00:54:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just tried it. And crazy things happened just from this oatmeal. First of all, I expected to gain weight because I was eating carbs, I didn't. And two, I was like, that did amazing things to kill my sugar cravings. Because I think one of the big reasons my body wanted sugar so bad was because I wasn't giving it any at all. But when I would have just a little bit of carbs in the morning, my whole day was so much easier and so much better. And that's, that's the sort of thing that you can see when you just change one habit at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3314" target="_blank">00:55:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And same thing with like adding vegetables, or just like adding more vegetables to your dinner, just start with dinner or lunch or something like that. And you can see when you when you make changes that way, you can see what is and what isn't working. And you can adjust accordingly. And then you can see your progress. And you can see exactly what the building blocks you need to create your healthy lifestyle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3335" target="_blank">00:55:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Alright, I hope everyone can put some of this to good use. One last thing you mentioned sugar. I have this thing in my head. And I think it's totally wrong, but I can't get over it. So maybe maybe you can help. I've associated sugar with bad and I'm like, sugar, which I know nothing, nothing is nothing should be bad or good. And so somehow I've like translated sugar being bad to fruit has a lot of natural sugar. And fruit falls in the dessert bucket.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3363" target="_blank">00:56:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, fruit is magic. I love fruit so much. It's funny, I always am trying to like decide what my favorite fruit is. And I think I just do this to torture myself because it's always whatever's in season and is amazing right now. Like the melons right now are so good. Like brings a tear to the eye and those pluots. But there's nothing wrong with fruit. Can you gain weight eating fruit? Totally. If you eat a ton of fruit, you can gain weight eating anything, right? You can lose weight eating anything. It's really just a matter of how much you're eating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3391" target="_blank">00:56:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And that sounds simple, but it's it's true. On one level, the problem is, if you aren't eating a lot of protein, and you then you can feel more hungry, and you will tend to eat more. And that's how people end up gaining weight is if they're eating more because they're not satisfied with what they are getting. But, you know, there's plenty of room for fruit. And in a healthy diet, it's a wonderful thing. And I find fruit is so ethereal, you know, it's like the really good stuff will be in season for like a few weeks at their peak.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3421" target="_blank">00:57:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">They're really good cherries, really good strawberries. And like nothing on earth would tell me to ever tell somebody to like, slow down on that. Go nuts. They're so good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3430" target="_blank">00:57:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there an easy way to figure out what's in season right now?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3433" target="_blank">00:57:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the easiest way is to go to your local farmers market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3436" target="_blank">00:57:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And they just only sell what's in season.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3438" target="_blank">00:57:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I mean, you know, it's funny. It's like, people ask me this all the time. And I just picked it up by by going to the market. But if you want to think about it in broad terms. So in the spring,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3450" target="_blank">00:57:30.520</a></span> | <span class="t">everything's coming up, right, everything was dead and cold, and everything's coming up. So you get buds, you get asparagus shooting out of the ground, you get fresh lettuces, you get green garlic, you get sort of the delicate early stuff, you don't start really seeing new fruit until strawberries come out kind of in the late spring, early summer, and then you start getting like a fruit bonanza.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3471" target="_blank">00:57:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then in the summer, like it progresses into more, more hearty vegetables, carrots, broccolis, cauliflowers, things like that. Later in the summer, you get stuff that like takes a lot more ripening. So you think about like harvests, and what takes a long time, like a tomato takes longer to ripen, winter squash take longer to ripen, corn takes longer to ripen, apples, pears kind of even later in the summer, melons are early or late summer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3495" target="_blank">00:58:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you move into winter, you start to have to like have the more hearty foods that are going to survive the frost, you get pomegranates at the beginning, you get a lot of root vegetables, tubers, heartier kales, things like that. In the winter, we eat a lot of radicchio salads, a lot of bitter greens. And then that's why we're so happy when the sweet ones come out in the spring again. But yeah, I mean, there's certain things that are kind of good all year, like broccoli, cauliflower, kale, I mean, they're pretty good all year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3524" target="_blank">00:58:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You can always get onions, you can always get garlic, although they're usually grown in certain times of year and then stored winter squash in the winter, summer squash in the summer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3532" target="_blank">00:58:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, the squash camp makes it so easy. If they just named every vegetable with or fruit when it when it's ripe, that would be wonderful, wouldn't it? Awesome. Okay, now I'm hungry, which is probably the worst time to go figure out what to eat. But before we go, I want you to share a little bit about what you're working on now because I know you have a new podcast and tell people where to find everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3551" target="_blank">00:59:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, thank you. I'm recently launched the Daria Rose show, which is all about me. I really wanted to just tackle some of the the harder problems I was seeing in the world. So I had a podcast called foodist about all this stuff we're talking about right now. And it was awesome. But then I had a bunch of babies. And that kind of fell aside for two years, I think COVID hit, and the whole world turned upside down. And I just felt like I needed to take a step back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3581" target="_blank">00:59:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And address more basic questions. So instead of just personal health, like, how do we know what's true anymore? Like, I felt like I had to step back and define that before I could even really get started on episodes. So like my first four or five episodes are all about figuring out how to know what's true in the media, in science, in health and medicine. And I just interviewed some amazing people and that front and then just other other personal health questions that aren't specific to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3611" target="_blank">01:00:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">food. For instance, I have an episode about sunscreen and how how to pick a sunscreen because that's surprisingly complicated and tricky. So just those questions that are kind of hard kind of controversial, but that you need answers to to navigate your life. And I just take a very fact based science based approach and do what I've always done in food and kind of apply it to these other. These other questions been really, really fun. It's been awesome to talk to smart people again and learn so much from others and share that with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3641" target="_blank">01:00:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">my audience who are so wonderful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://dcs.megaphone.fm/ATHLLC2732247946.mp3?key=ff7f77a5c81f9c47b03540769200e633&request_event_id=afec2c6f-8a29-4364-8fcb-c669cf9bc1ec&t=3643" target="_blank">01:00:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, the show is fantastic.
