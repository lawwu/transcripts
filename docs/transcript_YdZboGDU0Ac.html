I think the first thing that people need to do is simply ask themselves a set of questions around time as an asset. Questions that sort of frame up the fact that time is a valuable asset in their life and one that is terrifyingly finite and impermanent.</p><p>So each section of the book is framed around one big question. The big question in time wealth is how many moments do you have remaining with the people you love? And we talked about this last time in the context of those charts. These short windows of time during which these people occupy your life.</p><p>They are very finite and we don't think about that enough in the moment. We think about it at the end once it's too late. Time has this funny nature where for most people you think about it not at all until the very end when it's the only thing you think about but then it's too late.</p><p>You can't do anything about it. Asking yourself those questions in the present along the way is the path to actually developing more awareness about that time, about the fact that it is finite.</p></div></div></body></html>
