If you have questions or want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=23" target="_blank">00:00:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to dig in, go ahead. I have about -- I think I have about 45 minutes worth of slides, probably.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a lot of -- like, there's probably four hours worth of information in these papers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that I could cover. So, if we do want to dig into any of the -- especially the bio side</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=41" target="_blank">00:00:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of things, I can describe a lot of what's going on in more detail. But I focus mostly on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">machine learning stuff. But I'm going to give a little bit of a, you know, genetics -- two-slide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">introduction to genetics just for people who don't have -- don't have experience with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Great. So, whoops. Why is it not? Okay. So, this is sort of the why. So, the Evo is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">foundation model. It's like in a series of -- there was like hyena DNA and then there was Evo and then Evo 2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a 7b and 40b model. And the purpose of a model like this -- so, it's nucleotide-based, meaning it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">actually modeling the DNA sequences. And the purpose -- these are some of the applications on this slide for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, there's a lot of prediction things where you can -- like, for just like -- I'll go through these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe not all of them, but I'll go through a lot of them. So, like -- so, like, if I -- if I knock out genes, is it important?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Does it impact -- you know, does it impact, like, the health of the person or some -- the function of something?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or does it not matter? Or, like, a portion of the gene? What -- this one is actually really, really important and hard to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, they seem to have made progress. I don't know enough about the biology to know how realistic what they're saying -- they're claiming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is and how well they've tested it. But, you know, being able to predict the effect of your genetic variations on, like, drug treatments,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">your health, other things like that, is sort of the precision medicine promise. And it's quite difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And -- but this kind of model seems to be helpful for that. Like, designing genome scale things, I didn't -- I don't really understand that use case super well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in terms of, in terms of practical things, maybe for a study. But, like, looking at -- predicting, like, sort of --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">protein mutations based on gene changes. You know, sort of things in the protein. Like, what feature -- like, identifying structures in the feature --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, structures in protein folds. You know, sort of designing proteins. Predicting, you know, sort of, like, in the RNA, like, being able to --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">find mutations. You know, sort of, predict whether a RNA strand will be stable or not. Sort of, like --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of, like -- and then, um, things in the epigenome. Epigenome is, like, how --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is other physical mechanisms that cause genes to be more or less expressed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so -- and chromatin is, like, a major -- one of the most important things with that. And so, um, like, sort of, making predictions about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, all of these things, they have these really -- either really important scientific or sort of -- scientific consequences, like being able to understand or monitor or measure things better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or they actually have impact on your ability to, um, sort of, sort of, make clinical decisions with. So, I think -- so, there's, like -- doing this well is exciting. And it does seem like --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like, um, this does seem like a bit of a step change to me, um, with not knowing a whole lot. There's been a lot of attempts at models like this, and they do work. But this seems to -- you know, because it's well-funded and done, um, by a large team and, um, you know, sort of, like, has support from NVIDIA and other things, it seems to be, like, a pretty -- pretty impressive effort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so, uh, this is -- so, uh, the interesting thing about EVO is that this is not just for a human genome. This is for -- so, they -- they incorporated, uh, genomes. So, each point on this UMAP is a separate genome. Um, and -- or, uh, part of -- at least part of a separate genome. And --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and, um, so, you can see there's, like, a ton of different, uh, ton of different genomes here. And I think this core data, that's where humans would be, um, somewhere in there. So, uh, um, so you can see -- and that's, I guess, this one, probably. So, um, this area. So, like, uh, you can see that it's -- you know, that there's a lot of other stuff that got included.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that the purpose of that is to be able to, uh, transfer your understanding of the behavior of genetics from these other species into humans and also to study those other species.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Okay. Is that clear before I dive into this? Please interrupt if you guys have questions. Um, okay. So, uh, this is -- I say, probably wrong, because this is --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">-- this is just my pretty lay understanding based on, like, you know, you know, college biology and, uh, and, you know, conversations with, you know, um, computational biologists and things like that. So, um, but I think that for AI, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that for AI engineers, we don't need to understand it too well. There's, like, sort of -- so I'm going to give a conceptual view and then maybe one level deeper. Um, that -- so, um, there's -- genetics kind of deals with, um, these three factors. And then there's lots of other stuff that is related, but DNA, RNA, and then proteins. So -- and then proteins turn into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">into larger structures and -- and signaling and all sorts of stuff. But, um, you know, sort of, like, at its core, at least from my understanding, um, uh, you know, you sort of have DNA, and this is, like, the long-term storage. And so -- and I like to think about this as the software, right? Like, this is the -- this is the -- this is the program that your cells follow in order to create proteins,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">proteins, which are sort of like hardware and sort of like software. So, like, either -- and you could call it software</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or RTL. So, like, you're, you know, describing how to synthesize a piece of hardware, maybe. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then RNA is like -- and then RNA is like -- is a less stable, um, kind of very similar to DNA, but less stable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">more reactive, and it gets duplicated from RNA. And I think that the important thing about it -- one -- or one of the important things about it is it -- it actually gets, uh, repeatedly copied, right? So -- and so that the -- in the level of -- the -- the amount of expression of that --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that -- that, um, the genes in RNA impact the behavior of the cell. So, that could be because it affects the behavior --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or the -- the expression of other genes. It could be because it signals to other places in the cell or outside the cell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">um, and it also -- um, the RNA is sort of the mechanism by which proteins are created, um, in the -- in the cell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I -- I think that, um, when I previously understood -- until, like, the sort of modern era, when I -- like, you know, when you learn this way back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">when I was learning it in college or whatever, um, I learned -- you know, I just had this concept of, like, these abstract things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and their proteins and, you know, they're just, like, these strands and they kind of fold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, like, I didn't really get what they -- like, how -- how that, like, sort of fits into -- like, creates all these, like, structures, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, like, these are enormously complex cells. So, I -- I -- I think -- I want to just click on this -- this -- um, this video really quick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is -- this is what's called an enzyme. An enzyme -- excuse me -- is a -- is a molecular machine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's created by -- from many proteins, right? And this particular one is called ATP synthase.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's what turns -- it, like, sort of re-freshes -- I think it's ATD, I think -- um, and it turns it into ATP by adding -- um, by, like, sort of mechanically -- um, by mechanically putting two pieces of -- of -- of protein together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that that -- putting the proteins together sort of, like, causes -- you know, it gives the energy that can be released later, like a spring or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And -- and so they -- like, there's -- so this video -- sorry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you guys hear that or no?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if I can hear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You cannot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You cannot. Oh, yeah, that's okay. So, like, I -- the important thing here is that -- like, so these are ATPs that are going into here, right? And then --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, this is all just a bunch of proteins together, right? And you can see the -- there's this -- there's this -- there's this sort of --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that's turning in here. And there's actually literally an electric motor. So, you can see it down at the bottom here. So, the -- there's, like -- there's a membrane, and then there's, like, a bunch of proteins -- or, sorry, a bunch of hydrogen ions down at the bottom -- or --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, protons or hydrogen ions. And they're those, like, sort of, you know, like, sort of super energized things at the bottom. And that causes this to turn. And that causes you -- it to re -- like, refresh the ATP. Right? So, like, this is -- this is what -- this is, like, one example, one of the more impressive ones, but still, like, just one example of the crazy stuff that gets constructed by --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">-- by basically folding by -- by, like, sort of putting together these proteins into these molecular machines, enzymes, plus signaling, plus other structures. So, I -- I just -- I -- I -- I -- I wanted to just go over that just to be clear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that there's, like, there's, like, this -- this is, like, what's being constructed. It's not just, like, some soup of -- of protein that somehow magically turns into -- into, like, a cell, and then cells into people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">-- Okay. Sorry. So, that's -- that's, like, my -- okay. That's, like, sort of the conceptual view. And then, there's -- so, then, there's, like, a logical view that I have that is, like, basically -- so, for DNA, there's basically four nucleotides.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">-- and this is kind of an approximation, actually, but it's more or less -- there's four nucleotides. So, and they have names, but you just remember A, T, C, G.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they -- they kind of -- they -- they fit together. Like, I think A and T and C and G fit together. So, they're called base pairs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you -- they can also fit to -- they can, like, bind to each other next to each other. So, you can just have these -- from a conceptual standpoint, you just have a long sentence of -- with four -- four letters in them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">-- right? For -- so, there's four tokens, A, T, C, and G. And then, you just have a sequence of those. And that's what code -- so, those, sort of, are in your long-term storage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, DNA gets transcribed into RNA, which is basically the same, but you -- the T is a U in RNA in it. So, that has different chemical properties.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's less stable, meaning -- and -- and so, that allows it to be more -- and it doesn't turn into a double helix. So, that it -- it allows it to be more easily, like, chopped up and -- and shuttled around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, like, it's just more convenient for transcribing. So, that what happens is DNA gets copied into RNA. You get these, like, sequences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, shorthanding quite a bit, the RNA turns into -- there's, like, sequences of three RNAs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And those are called codons. And the codons attach to amino acids. And so, that these codons, sort of, like, these patterns of codons,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">then turn into amino acids, like -- or bind to amino acids and stick them together into these long, what's called a polymer chain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that -- that polymer chain is a protein. And then, the proteins fold because of their chemical properties.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they turn into those amazing molecular machines. Okay. So, like, that's very, very, like, high-level summary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, but I think the important thing for an AI engineer to know about this is that there's kind of two main things that I've been calling out here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One is that the genes are, like, really long, right? Like, you have these long, long, long, long sequences, you know, in the 1,000 to 1 million token range.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? And then, the vocab is obviously very small. So, your vocabulary is for tokens. And then, they actually added some other special tokens because they're just using a single byte encoding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=889" target="_blank">00:14:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what do you do with the rest of the possible tokens? And so, they have them, like, one token per species, basically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Is that -- so, that's my introduction to genetics. Is -- I hope that's enough for you guys to understand the rest of the discussion. Do you guys want to ask any questions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I just want to say, I love the effort put into translating things for AI engineers. I think it's very -- this slide, quite important. And, yeah. I like it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Excellent. Thank you. Okay. All right. So, okay. So, let's -- now we're going to, you know, here's like a, you know, like a, like a gear shift with no clutch here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I'm going to switch to the sort of -- okay, this is the main sort of mechanism by which this model is able to have long, like, efficient inference on very long context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, with that -- so, I'll build up to why that -- this mechanism works. But, basically, starting in this -- this has been research that has been developed at Stanford over the past several years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this -- this part of it is a little old. But -- and this refers to a previous paper that isn't in the list that we read today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, basically, they developed this -- what they call a hyena operator. I don't know the origin of the name. But, basically, as a surrogate --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">originally, as a surrogate for attention, right? So, how can we -- and the sort of research question, I think, was basically, how can we replace attention with something that is -- is based on convolutions, which is kind of similar -- like, you've probably heard of state-space models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is an example of a type of state-space model. And so, because -- the reason why you would want to do that is because you can -- convolutions are more efficient to calculate than a full attention -- self-attention matrix, right? So -- so that they can be -- and it's not obvious why from this diagram. I'll show you why.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But that -- that's sort of the why of it, is they're more efficient to calculate. And so -- and the -- you know, just to be clear, what's going on here is that you have these sort of like -- you know, so you have like -- this is a convolution. And this is called a toplitz matrix, which is just a -- you know, sort of like an unrolling of the convolution into -- into a matrix. And then, you have weightings on those convolutions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you have these pairs of like a weight plus the convolution plus a weight plus a convolution and some like arbitrary number of those stuck together. And then, you can get this thing that kind of sort of approximates the behavior of attention. So, this H U is basically a replacement or a surrogate for attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But -- and -- and -- and it's important to note that there's two ways to represent -- and like there's probably more, but like there's two -- at least two ways to represent this convolution. One is as this toplitz matrix. But the other is this -- quote unquote -- they call it implicit --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">parameterization, which means is -- think IIAR filter, if you're familiar with those, or recurrent model, if you're familiar with those, where you're taking the previous state and you're just calculating an update.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">rather than having all of the updates sort of written out for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1114" target="_blank">00:18:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Good so far?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So -- and then, here's the why again. Convolution is faster than attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it's faster than attention. But, you know, note -- and they actually talk about this in the paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1128" target="_blank">00:18:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's true in the limit. It's not true at short sequence lengths. Right? So, if you look at hyena here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it's actually slower than flash attention up until you get to this like 3 -- 10 to the 3.8, which I don't know what -- that's probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what -- like about, you know, maybe 5,000 or something -- context length.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1156" target="_blank">00:19:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And also notice the -- the performance, although, you know, they claim is, you know, sort of like a surrogate for attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't actually do as well as -- as -- as GTP -- GTP, NEO, which is a regular attention-based model, or our WKV.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hopefully, Eugene's on the call. So, Eugene, you're waiting to --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm waiting to help answer questions for this part if needed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah. Please. I -- I don't have any questions yet. But if other people do -- and -- and especially, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of details on space models, I know -- you know a lot about them in comparison to RWKV.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1208" target="_blank">00:20:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so -- so -- so then, this is a slide on striped hyena. So -- and also striped hyena -- and striped hyena, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is what they use for EVO2. So, they actually -- so here, in this Toplitz matrix here, you see that, like, the question is sort of like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1234" target="_blank">00:20:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, well, I have this full attention block, and then I have, like, my fully realized Toplitz matrix.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1243" target="_blank">00:20:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, how am I actually saving in memory or whatever, right, or computation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1247" target="_blank">00:20:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, like, part of the answer is, well, you know, you can -- you can perform -- perform this convolution in the frequency domain, and it's faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1261" target="_blank">00:21:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that is a good answer. But also, part of it is, well, actually, it's both, like, more efficient and -- and more --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">both more efficient and better results. If you actually use different -- different convolutional -- or these hyena operators -- so this, like, sort of -- this, like, sort of --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">pair of, like, this guy plus this guy, you know, and then you have, like, a chain of those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1293" target="_blank">00:21:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can do that in different ways. And so they have three different ways that they propose to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">one is this short explicit, and you can -- disappointingly, they didn't have a good Toplitz matrix diagram of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1305" target="_blank">00:21:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can see, like, this is basically a line here. So it's -- it's, like, sort of -- you can think of it as -- as, like --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1313" target="_blank">00:21:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">being somewhat related to local attention, right, where you have just a few tokens of context close by that you're looking at, and everything else is zero.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you have this medium regularized, which is, like, more context in the --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1333" target="_blank">00:22:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in the range of a couple hundred tokens of context, and everything else is zero.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1339" target="_blank">00:22:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you have this long implicit, which -- which means I'm going to use this implicit representation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1346" target="_blank">00:22:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe I'll have to do recurrence in, you know, in -- in the -- in this block, or maybe I will, like, sort of hybridize that with, you know, sort of some implicit and some explicit representation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But in any event, you have this -- it has a more efficient way of calculating using FFTs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1371" target="_blank">00:22:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this -- even if it's, you know, like, sort of fully realized, it still is more efficient than attention to calculate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So -- and then, you know, so the idea is that you have this stack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1385" target="_blank">00:23:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So instead of having attention block, attention block, attention block, you know, you have this S-E-M-R-L-I, and then an attention block, and then S-E-R-L-R-M-R-L-I.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, like, so you kind of stack these up so that you end up with, you know, sort of your different layers calculating sort of their attention surrogates in different ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1411" target="_blank">00:23:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it turns out -- well, first of all, just to be a little more clear, this -- so this is like a FIR filter, you know, four to seven tokens in depth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is like a FIR filter, and they, quote, unquote, regularize this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually -- so Eugene, this is actually one place where I had a question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They say that this alpha is swept across channels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't actually quite understand what that means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1441" target="_blank">00:24:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you have a -- did you -- I don't know if you read the paper or not, but, like, did you understand what this is?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1446" target="_blank">00:24:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think the way to view these segments, right, and this makes sense once you view -- understand how, like, future states-based models work, right, is a way to visualize it as you process the tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's just say -- and you can view this as a genetic sequence, left to right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1466" target="_blank">00:24:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I hope people can see my hands right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1468" target="_blank">00:24:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, left to right, the whole sequence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1470" target="_blank">00:24:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Same thing with types as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1471" target="_blank">00:24:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The way -- the way these tokens are being merged is the -- at the start, like, these tokens gets processed and gets merged together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1480" target="_blank">00:24:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So as a state-space model built the state by merging everything together over the layers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that make sense?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1487" target="_blank">00:24:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Over time and over the layers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1489" target="_blank">00:24:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So -- and -- and so -- so what this means here, right, in this case, right, they had these few -- first few layers that process the tokens that come in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1497" target="_blank">00:24:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're talking about 47 tokens, and then it gets regularized and then merged into other chunks of tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1505" target="_blank">00:25:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's, let's say, 47.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1507" target="_blank">00:25:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't remember what's the exact size for future states-based models and the models at that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1512" target="_blank">00:25:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it just keeps merging, cascadingly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1514" target="_blank">00:25:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And therefore, like -- therefore, like, the layers that deal with the longer implicit attention, they get -- they view the summarized information from the previous layers that then gets merged in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1525" target="_blank">00:25:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, hence, why -- why -- why they show that separation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1527" target="_blank">00:25:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because at -- at this point, they were still testing and trying to figure out how to best manage long contact sync.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1534" target="_blank">00:25:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And -- and -- for -- for genetic modeling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1538" target="_blank">00:25:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And -- and -- and part of the evaluation was that if they just use -- if they just keep one state, and then they keep merging in, it performed worse in the case of state space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1549" target="_blank">00:25:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And to have, like -- have it, like, pre -- pre-processed with the short explicit, and then subsequently merge into medium, and then merge into large.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1556" target="_blank">00:25:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1558" target="_blank">00:25:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1560" target="_blank">00:26:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I guess -- yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1561" target="_blank">00:26:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1562" target="_blank">00:26:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, the pre-processing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I -- so, that's a really good way to think about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1567" target="_blank">00:26:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1568" target="_blank">00:26:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What I was actually asking about was this alpha parameter is -- it -- it says in the paper that it's swept across the channels, and they don't really go into what that means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that means that I -- I think I understand what channels are, is just basically the different dimensions in your hidden dimension.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1589" target="_blank">00:26:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1590" target="_blank">00:26:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So -- but then, like, I wouldn't understand -- I don't really understand why sweeping this would be a good idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1599" target="_blank">00:26:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or, like, what -- or if I'm completely misunderstanding what they're saying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1604" target="_blank">00:26:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I -- I think it's just view it as -- it's applying that decay as the information flows in, to force the model to, like, just summarize it even further.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1617" target="_blank">00:26:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because -- because even -- even in RRKV, we have that decay mechanism, where -- where, by default, every piece of information will be tried to be forgotten, unless the model has decided that this is important to remember.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1632" target="_blank">00:27:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1634" target="_blank">00:27:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1635" target="_blank">00:27:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So -- so -- so -- so that decay, right, kicks in to help force the model to forget things by default.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1642" target="_blank">00:27:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1643" target="_blank">00:27:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Unless -- as part of the metric multiplication calculations, it decides that, hey, I should amplify this signal instead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1648" target="_blank">00:27:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And -- and if -- and I think genetic modeling is a very good example of, like, understanding why recurrent models are highly favorable to, like, even this use case, or even -- or even sometimes can be used for tags.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1662" target="_blank">00:27:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's because at the end of the day, right, like, if you look at the genetic code, right, it's one of the cases where it's highly repetitive, the data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1669" target="_blank">00:27:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1670" target="_blank">00:27:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but there is, like, slight changes that we need to capture meaning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1673" target="_blank">00:27:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1674" target="_blank">00:27:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you view it from a compression point, we were talking, like, zip compression and things like -- it's highly compressible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1679" target="_blank">00:27:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1680" target="_blank">00:28:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1681" target="_blank">00:28:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so -- so what you actually -- what you want the model to actually learn is the pattern and the anomalies, the peaks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1688" target="_blank">00:28:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1689" target="_blank">00:28:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So -- and to discard the repetitions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1691" target="_blank">00:28:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I know I'm -- this is not the accurate way to say it, but in this use case, right, so by default, if we discard everything towards decay, the peaks -- like, hey, this is weird.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1702" target="_blank">00:28:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why is genome 364, for example, is ABBBA, not as what the repetition should be?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1711" target="_blank">00:28:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1712" target="_blank">00:28:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then the matrix multiplication will pick that value, and then it will try to, like, conserve it into memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1717" target="_blank">00:28:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1718" target="_blank">00:28:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1719" target="_blank">00:28:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why -- it may sound vague, but it's more of, like, the decays there by default and how it works from there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1726" target="_blank">00:28:46.000</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1731" target="_blank">00:28:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So -- let's see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1734" target="_blank">00:28:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So -- so basically -- and this is just, like, sort of -- this is kind of an ablation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1743" target="_blank">00:29:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They -- they -- they studied, okay, the multi-head attention with their -- you know, sort of, like, if they -- you just make these all multi-head attention, you -- you train for 400 billion tokens, and then you get a perplexity of 3.09, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1759" target="_blank">00:29:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1760" target="_blank">00:29:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they looked at this LI LI LI LI, which is this one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1763" target="_blank">00:29:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This was the original design of striped hyena.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1768" target="_blank">00:29:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you get this .2.87, so a bit better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1774" target="_blank">00:29:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, interestingly, if you just replace these two first LIs with these SEs, you get the same basic perplexity, so these LI -- so it doesn't hurt to have this more efficient, very short convolution instead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1791" target="_blank">00:29:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they found that, like, you do even slightly better if you stick an MR in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1796" target="_blank">00:29:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So -- so -- so -- and -- and, you know, like, for what it's worth at -- at this -- you know, in this model at -- with this data, like, at this point in the training process, beating multi-head attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1810" target="_blank">00:30:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then -- and then I actually -- here's another place I don't understand what this ABF positional embedding is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1824" target="_blank">00:30:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I stuck it in here more as a hope that someone else would explain this slide.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1829" target="_blank">00:30:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I -- if not, I don't think it -- they didn't seem to think it was super important, but that, like, basically, this -- it's a more scalable, you know, this ABF is more scalable, and they get up to a million tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1844" target="_blank">00:30:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It seems -- one -- one thing I was a little unclear about is why is the perplexity going down as the context length goes up, you guys?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1851" target="_blank">00:30:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it just data distribution difference, or -- I'm not sure. Did anyone pick up on that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1856" target="_blank">00:30:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For genetic sequencing, that is -- should be expected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1860" target="_blank">00:31:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Mostly because, like, say, majority of the data is going to be repetitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So once you've seen the pattern, you should be able to at least answer the pattern.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1868" target="_blank">00:31:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Okay. I see. Yeah, that makes sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1871" target="_blank">00:31:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1875" target="_blank">00:31:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So training -- so training here is -- is, you know, sort of, like, on both 7B and --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1885" target="_blank">00:31:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and 40B. Notice this is log scale significantly faster than dense transformer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1892" target="_blank">00:31:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, like, you can see it here, but I think maybe easier to understand is that, you know, like, one would be the same amount of time as Stripe Tyena 2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1903" target="_blank">00:31:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they beat, you know -- sorry, Tyena 1 plus they beat -- oops, sorry -- they beat the dense transformers by a factor of three or more here, and a little more than three and a little less than three here at the long context, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1919" target="_blank">00:31:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can -- this is what we expect, but it's sort of validation of this was one of the primary design points, and they're saying we kind of met the design point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1928" target="_blank">00:32:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And then they get into a lot of detail. I'm not -- I'm not going to go into a ton of detail here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1937" target="_blank">00:32:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's -- there's this sort of efficient two-stage block convolution algorithm that works well for these explicit parameterizations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1952" target="_blank">00:32:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, you know, from the upper left, here's, like, just a Toplitz matrix, and you can envision this as just blocks of matrices, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1963" target="_blank">00:32:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, so this is just the full Toplitz, you know, lower triangular matrix.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1969" target="_blank">00:32:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just making it into a smaller -- or I'm just chunking it into these different H -- capital Hs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1975" target="_blank">00:32:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then -- so what they're saying is that if you -- so you have this, like, a convolution, could -- like, if it's not a full --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1986" target="_blank">00:33:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">if it's, you know, like, a short FIR filter, it's only L sub H long, then I have all these zeros here, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=1995" target="_blank">00:33:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that I can actually -- if -- if this is kind of short, then I can actually represent this with just two --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2002" target="_blank">00:33:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like, the diagonal H0 and then H1 on the -- right next to the diagonal, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2009" target="_blank">00:33:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I -- this might not be clear from the diagram. I'm going to go into that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2014" target="_blank">00:33:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But just notice there's zeros here, so you don't need -- in this -- you don't need any -- any of the Hs in this lower left-hand corner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2023" target="_blank">00:33:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's sort of -- so, you know, this is a pretty good example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2027" target="_blank">00:33:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you just -- you know, let's say your sequence length is 6 and your -- and your filter length is 4, then -- then you have this, you know, sort of, like, on the diagonal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2041" target="_blank">00:34:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have this -- you can look at, like, this here is this, right? And then it's repeated here, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2050" target="_blank">00:34:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you have this off -- right adjacent to the diagonal, you have this guy, and that's right there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2056" target="_blank">00:34:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that could be decomposed into this plus this, right? And so what this allows you to do is much more efficient multiplication.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2070" target="_blank">00:34:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, and they -- so they, you know, study this, and it's indeed significantly faster in terms of the throughput, especially in terms of teraflops per second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2087" target="_blank">00:34:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it's basically double or more, two and a half times, I guess, at scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2095" target="_blank">00:34:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a good thing. And so this can be used for -- definitely for the SE, the small one, and then the small explicit, and then the medium regularized as well, depending on the block size.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2110" target="_blank">00:35:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, like -- and then this is a comparison of those blocks to other types of blocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2120" target="_blank">00:35:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is -- this is flash attention, this SPDA is -- is, like, non-flash attention, I guess, and then it compares to Mamba, and then XLSTM, and DeltaNet, which I don't -- I'm not familiar with these two, but presumably they're state-space models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2140" target="_blank">00:35:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're

you know, so basically taking your sequence of, in this case, genes, of tokens, and, you know, sort of inferring it in parallel, and then sharing the -- you know, sort of doing a --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2171" target="_blank">00:36:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of, like, scatter-gatherer approach or

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2184" target="_blank">00:36:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is at a bulk level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2225" target="_blank">00:37:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what -- and you just, like -- this overlap has to be forwarded to the next guy

-- this one, I don't get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2239" target="_blank">00:37:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Does anyone

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2264" target="_blank">00:37:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2265" target="_blank">00:37:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's part of the -- so, the first part is, like, the first chunk in parallel, and, like, by context thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2269" target="_blank">00:37:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, after that, the information is synced across, and then they get merged, and then you get your outputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2275" target="_blank">00:37:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Ah, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, that -- I think I see now. Okay. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2281" target="_blank">00:38:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing that I actually do admire the state-space team -- their formulation on is -- well, the high-level parts, right, the math can be rather complicated, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2291" target="_blank">00:38:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They actually design it in a way where you can reduce the operations onto a very few brilliant operations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2300" target="_blank">00:38:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that is extremely counterintuitive, but it's mathematically right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2307" target="_blank">00:38:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, they can do proof that this is a cheap and faster way to, like, do those steps, even though it may seem weird.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2312" target="_blank">00:38:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah, no. So, I spent, actually, quite a bit of time going through the -- sort of the background papers here to understand how the -- like, especially that -- the mapping from their surrogate attention to -- to, like, these hyena operators.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2330" target="_blank">00:38:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, like, actually, the math -- I didn't put it in the talk. It's actually pretty understandable, and I -- there's no, like -- you don't need differential equations, which is -- like, you need -- if you wanted to do the -- you know, sort of the continuous version, you need to use differential equations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2349" target="_blank">00:39:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But for the discrete version, like, you just -- it's all just basic algebra to understand. I recommend, if anyone really wants to understand what's going on under the hood here, you can go and check out the hyena paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2361" target="_blank">00:39:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I can give a link. It's actually linked up above in the talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2366" target="_blank">00:39:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So, that's sort of, like, the machinery. Does anyone want to ask or comment on the machinery part of this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2380" target="_blank">00:39:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Good. So, they did a bunch of -- they did a whole bunch of evals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2390" target="_blank">00:39:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think part of that is because, unlike the sort of, like, actual, you know, natural language version, there are not so many benchmarks. There are some benchmarks, but -- so, they have to -- so, a lot of what they do is benchmark against real-world, you know, sort of, like, real-world data sets that -- that -- that are, like, somewhat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2419" target="_blank">00:40:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">commonly used for evals or for -- or in some cases, they just came up with data sets to test against. So, they basically developed their own benchmarks for the study in a lot of cases. So, it's a little bit hard for me to understand how -- how well they're actually doing. This is an exception. I guess, needle and haystack, we're all familiar with. And it looks like they --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2448" target="_blank">00:40:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like, they do pretty well. There's not any red except for this guy. This 7B model seems to have trouble at a million context length with depth at 100%. So, for -- I don't really understand why I didn't look into it. So -- but in any event, like, they -- they seem to do pretty well. And the way that they do this is they just stick a generated 100 base pair sequence somewhere in the context, you know, at 10% and 20% and whatever. And then they --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2477" target="_blank">00:41:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then they perturb it and see if that -- how much that impacts the -- the sort of -- the likelihood of the -- the same sequence at the end of the context. So, I think this is -- this closely matches what is typically done for a needle in a haystack test. Except -- one thing that I -- was questionable to me was that -- they used a generated 100 base pair sequence. Instead of --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2504" target="_blank">00:41:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">just a generated 100 base pair sequence instead of using some actual out of distribution, you know, sort of like held out sequence from a genome that is not part of the training set. Because -- and I -- I find this questionable because since it's in distribution law, of course, you're going to naturally be perturbed if you have a -- if -- you're -- you're naturally going to have a lower -- or --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2533" target="_blank">00:42:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">-- lower likelihood if you perturb the -- the -- the needle. Right? Does that make sense?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2540" target="_blank">00:42:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No, I think that makes sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2545" target="_blank">00:42:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, so I feel like they -- this is -- unless I'm misunderstanding, I don't feel like this is the right test. Like, they should have used something out of distribution. Like, they actually -- in other places, they were really careful to hold out -- like, they held out certain viruses because -- I think for other reasons, but that -- they test whether or not, like, their performance on these out-of-distribution viruses. And it's really poor. And that's what -- they had actually intended that -- to be the design. Because I didn't -- I think they didn't want to bring in --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2546" target="_blank">00:42:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I feel like they, this is, unless I'm misunderstanding, I don't feel like this is the right test, right?

Or it might have been just for monitoring, but in any event, they should have used something that was held out from the distribution, or from the training set, sorry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2590" target="_blank">00:43:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So, okay, anyway. So then here, like, they have these, so one thing I love about these bioinformatics papers is their diagrams are often really, really good, and really interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2604" target="_blank">00:43:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I don't want to, like, I don't want to, like, I can talk about a few of these. I think the important thing is the title here is that they're able to predict the mutational effect of, on, like, proteins, and as measured in various ways, on RNA, on organism, organismal fitness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2628" target="_blank">00:43:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and across different domains of life, right, like, not only in humans or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2632" target="_blank">00:43:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, so I, if anyone's interested, I can go into the, I think I understand most of these diagrams, but, but I think one interesting thing to note is that these, all these zero shot,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2648" target="_blank">00:44:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, zero shot is really clear what it means in language modeling. In this case, I was a little confused about what they meant by a zero shot prediction here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2661" target="_blank">00:44:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what they're typically doing with these, all these studies is they're looking at what is the, you know, the change, like, in some cases, it's the change in likelihood or the likelihood of, you know, sort of a sequence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2677" target="_blank">00:44:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, using that to, as a threshold on that likelihood or other more complicated things to, to make a prediction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2685" target="_blank">00:44:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So they, so like, in this case, they're using the change in likelihood when they mutate a sequence and they use that as an indicator of whether it's essential or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2696" target="_blank">00:44:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, and I don't understand the biology of why that's a good test in this case, but, but that's generally, you know, you can see that here as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2708" target="_blank">00:45:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Here, maybe, I'm not sure it's, it can, can you guys read this, by the way, it might be hard to read and, but like the, so the delta likelihood, you know, like sort of is used to predict that whether or not it's an essential gene.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2724" target="_blank">00:45:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So is that, is that kind of clear from a, at least from a high standpoint? So they did it, like you can see each one of these is a section in the paper and they, they really, I think, did a very complete job of looking at, okay, we're trying to build a foundation model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2740" target="_blank">00:45:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So does it generalize to a lot of different use cases without being explicitly trained on those use cases? And I think they did a good job of, of, of making that claim.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2750" target="_blank">00:45:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And then this is, you know, more of the same kind of, but enables, you know, sort of like human clinical variant effect prediction. So, and I thought one of the, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2767" target="_blank">00:46:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically, similar stuff, but with human clinical effects, right? So, and this is probably one of the most important use cases for this model is being able to, to like, like I was saying in the beginning, being able to predict what will this, given the specific genetics of this patient, what will their response to this medication be or something like that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2794" target="_blank">00:46:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Or like, or like, what will their progress, how, how, what, which, how will their, their specific set of mutations impact the way a disease progresses, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2805" target="_blank">00:46:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are like super useful, you know, things you can imagine everyone gets, you know, you get a blood prick when you get, get on medication, they do, they sequence your genome if it's not already on file.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2819" target="_blank">00:46:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you, you can, you know, you can pick which medication to take based on, on your specific genome, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2826" target="_blank">00:47:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's, that's like, and this is kind of enabling that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2829" target="_blank">00:47:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't, I don't know how they claim they're doing a good job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2834" target="_blank">00:47:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it'll, you know, I think it'll, whether that bears out from a clinical standpoint, I don't know, but it like, you know, looks very promising.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2847" target="_blank">00:47:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so a little, sorry, anyone want to ask questions about either of these two slides?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2853" target="_blank">00:47:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, we got 10 more minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2856" target="_blank">00:47:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so, okay, so let me move Eugene.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2863" target="_blank">00:47:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, this is like information on how they train the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2867" target="_blank">00:47:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, um, so interestingly, you know, the way that they thought about this was how do, like, we're going to do a, um, we're, we're going to, uh, train, you know, a base, like, as, as is common with long context models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2885" target="_blank">00:48:05.900</a></span> | <span class="t">They do like a base training, um, and then they extend the context in, in like, sort of what they're calling mid training, um, that they did that the way they think about this is like, okay, what are the, what are the sort of genetic, um, units that we can fit in, you know, a certain, like an AK context link.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2908" target="_blank">00:48:28.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that, you know, you have like these, um, I think tRNA is transcript RNA, you have certain bacterial genes, um, non-coding RNA sequences, which help with the mechanism of transcription and other things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2923" target="_blank">00:48:43.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and, but like things you don't have are like these sort of like larger eukaryote genes, phages, um, you know, sort of like these transcript domains, um, for humans or yeast cells.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2937" target="_blank">00:48:57.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So like need a longer context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2940" target="_blank">00:49:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's interesting because I think unlike language modeling, you're the, there's the, like these, the things that are here and the things that are here are more qualitatively different, I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2952" target="_blank">00:49:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2953" target="_blank">00:49:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I found this to be a, like an interesting difference in language modeling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2958" target="_blank">00:49:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and this sort of shows, do you like the, the, um, the token counts for the two models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2966" target="_blank">00:49:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I won't go into this, the rest of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2971" target="_blank">00:49:31.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2973" target="_blank">00:49:33.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So then there was a, two really clever things that they did or like that clearly they are, um, they thought carefully about the evals here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2985" target="_blank">00:49:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So they, um, and I, this is part of a larger diagram that I can show, but they, um, is like super hard to understand, or it's like really chaotic and would take like 10 minutes to talk through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=2998" target="_blank">00:49:58.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So I, but the, the, the gist of it is all captured here where they, you know, they train a sparse autoencoder, they extract features, and then they identify biological features that, that they correspond to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3011" target="_blank">00:50:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3011" target="_blank">00:50:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and so they valid, and they were using this partly as, um, a way to verify that their model is actually learning biologically, uh, relevant things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3023" target="_blank">00:50:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3023" target="_blank">00:50:23.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's like sort of the operational standpoint that we already saw where like, yeah, we're able to predict things that are important, but this is more of a, look, you know, sort of a conceptual standpoint.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3034" target="_blank">00:50:34.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, can, can, can our, can we learn features that correspond to, um, you know, sort of like boundaries of genes and, um, you know, different kinds of different types of genes and other things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3048" target="_blank">00:50:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that make sense?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3050" target="_blank">00:50:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So I, I thought this was, um, interesting to include in an eval.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3056" target="_blank">00:50:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I think it's something that maybe, uh, we could do in language modeling as well, now that sparse autoencoders are becoming easier to work with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3065" target="_blank">00:51:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, the other thing that I thought was pretty clever was that they, um, they, so this chromatin accessibility is like basically an important, uh, so this is epigenetics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3083" target="_blank">00:51:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, meaning it's like heritable differences in, uh, the way that your genes are expressed, um, that are impacted by the environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3091" target="_blank">00:51:31.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically you're, so it's kind of, you know, I'm probably going to, it's like a geneticist will probably like, you know, throw up if I say it wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3101" target="_blank">00:51:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But, um, you know, it's like basically a way that your, your, your genome can learn about its environment, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3109" target="_blank">00:51:49.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So that like you can, so that it impacts how much, or how the ways in which your genome is, is actually expressed based on your environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3118" target="_blank">00:51:58.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can pass this in some cases onto your children.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3121" target="_blank">00:52:01.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's also heritable, but it's a different mechanism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3124" target="_blank">00:52:04.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, chromatin is one of the main ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3126" target="_blank">00:52:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">There are others, so, um, so what's going on here is, um, they, uh, they basically want in order to, to be able to either do, you know, sort of like in, like, um, like in, uh, com computer simulation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3148" target="_blank">00:52:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, like using their model or other things of chromatin accessibility, or actually to design, um, design genes that they can, you know, use CRISPR and other, um, additive mechanisms to stick, uh, things into, uh, into the genome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3168" target="_blank">00:52:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and, and, and, and, and be able to control it's, you, this quote, unquote, chromatin accessibility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3175" target="_blank">00:52:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So what they.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3176" target="_blank">00:52:56.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Did was they basically sampled sequences and then they use this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3182" target="_blank">00:53:02.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you can just think of this as a classifier basically is, is, is, is this region accessible or not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3189" target="_blank">00:53:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and then they would, they accept some and rejects them and then they just shop out the rejected part and then like, according to the criteria and then, um, and then just keep reject and then take the only the accepted part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3205" target="_blank">00:53:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then generate from there on and, and then just keep iterating in that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3209" target="_blank">00:53:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's sort of like a, um, um, constrained generation basically using this sort of, um, this, this, um, really complex model to be the, be the signal that decides whether or not to reject or, or, or like the constraint.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3229" target="_blank">00:53:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So I thought this was also very clever, um, take on constrained generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3235" target="_blank">00:53:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and like, sort of get, it, it, it got me to thinking about, okay, what besides like, you know, right now we have these very deterministic things that we do, uh, constrained generation with what are the, you know, sort of more, uh, more sophisticated things and like sort of models and downstream things that you could use for constrained generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3255" target="_blank">00:54:15.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3257" target="_blank">00:54:17.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So like this, you know, again, like sort of truck driver stop, but that's the end of the slides.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3263" target="_blank">00:54:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Does anyone want to comment, ask questions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3266" target="_blank">00:54:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I can review stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3267" target="_blank">00:54:27.860</a></span> | <span class="t">We have only three minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3269" target="_blank">00:54:29.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, there's a question regarding, do you get a chance to look into how the data collection was done?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3274" target="_blank">00:54:34.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Like what was done for evil one?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3276" target="_blank">00:54:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">What was done for evil two, um, specifically, I guess for the training and processes and all that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3282" target="_blank">00:54:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3283" target="_blank">00:54:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, uh, they do go over that in the paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3285" target="_blank">00:54:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, uh, they actually, they, they formed a reasonably large data set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3293" target="_blank">00:54:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, here, let me see if I can

do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3514" target="_blank">00:58:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that.</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:58:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">like the grammar, so the, the equivalent would be like the English grammar here, right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:59:13.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Anglo-Saxacan languages, basically English, French, that, that, that whole category, not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpJRiorDQnw&t=3559" target="_blank">00:59:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">including Chinese and Japanese, because there's, there's a different category
