One is when you actually do just allow yourself that moment to recognize, wait a minute, what's actually going on is that I have learned more than I knew before.</p><p>It's just that my confidence has gone down actually no more than I did a month ago, a year ago, 10 years ago, it helps to reframe and remind you, wait a minute, no, I am actually getting better at this in terms of my knowledge base. And what follows knowledge is skill.</p><p>So as long as you keep learning, you keep practicing, you keep trying, your skill is going to catch up with that knowledge. And so in the beginning, it really is just reminding yourself, no, no, no, no, no, it doesn't feel easy right now. But there is value in continuing to work on this.</p></div></div></body></html>
