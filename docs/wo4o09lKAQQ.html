But I'm kind of skeptical of kind of any kind of precise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=14" target="_blank">00:00:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">mathematical or exponential prediction of how it's going to be. I think it's, I think it's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=19" target="_blank">00:00:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's all going to be a mess. But I think what we know is it's on a metaphorical exponential,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=24" target="_blank">00:00:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's going to happen fast. We're already at the point where if you look at the loss,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=28" target="_blank">00:00:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the scaling laws are starting to bend. I mean, we've seen that in, you know, published model cards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">offered by multiple companies. So that's not a secret at all. But as, as they start to bend,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">each little bit of, of entropy, right, of accurate prediction becomes more important, right? Maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">these last little bits, bits of entropy are like, well, you know, this is a physics paper, as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Einstein would have written it, as opposed to, you know, as some other physicist would have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">would have, would have written it. And so it's, it's hard to assess significance from this. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">certainly looks like in terms of practical performance, the metrics keep going up relatively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">linearly, although they're always unpredictable. So, so it's, it's hard to see that. And then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the thing that I think is driving the most acceleration is just more and more money is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">into the field. Like people are seeing that there's just a huge amount of, you know, of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of economic value. And so I expect the amount of money spent on the largest models to go up by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like a factor of 100 or something. And for that, that then to be concatenated with the chips are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">getting faster, the algorithms are getting better, because there's, there's so many people working on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this now. And so, and so again, I mean that, you know, I'm not making a normative statement here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">this is what should happen. I'm not even saying this necessarily will happen, because I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">there's important safety and government questions here, which we're very actively working on. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">just, I'm just saying like left to itself, this is what the economy is going to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">- So do you think that another thing on the scale of a transformer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is coming down the pike to enable the next, the next great iterations?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">- I think it's possible. I mean, people have worked on things like, you know, trying to model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">very long time dependencies, or, you know, you know, there's various different ideas where I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">could see that we're kind of missing an efficient way of representing or dealing with something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think those inventions are possible. I guess my perspective would be, even if they don't happen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we're, we're all, we're already on this very, very steep trajectory. And so I'm less, I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">we're constantly trying to discover them as are, as are others. But things are already on such a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">fast trajectory, all that would do is speed up the trajectory even more. And probably, probably not by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that much, because it's already going so fast. I think we've been relatively responsible in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">sense that, you know, the big acceleration that happened late last year, and beginning of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">year, like, we didn't cause that we weren't, we weren't the ones who did that. And honestly, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">think if you look at the reaction to Google, that that might be 10 times more important than anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">else. And then kind of once it had happened, once the ecosystem had changed, then we did a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">things to kind of to kind of stay on the frontier. And so I don't know, it's, it's, I mean, it's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">any other question, right? It's like, you're trying to, you're trying to do the things that have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">lowest costs and the biggest benefits. And you know, that that causes you to have different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">strategies at different times. How likely do you think it is that these models will be superhuman</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">for many years at economically valuable tasks, while there are still below humans in many other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">relevant tasks that prevents like an intelligence explosion or something? I think this kind of stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is like really hard to know. So I'll give I'll give that caveat that like, you know, again, like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the basic scaling laws, you can kind of predict, and then like this more granular stuff, which we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">really want to know to know how this all is going to go is much harder to know. But my guess would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">be the scaling laws are going to continue, you know, again, subject to, you know, do people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">slow down for safety or for regulatory reasons. But you know, let's just let's just put all that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">aside and say, like, we have the economic capability to keep scaling. If we did that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">what would happen? And I think my view is we're going to keep getting better across the board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't see any area where the models are like, super, super weak or not starting to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">progress like that used to be true of like math and programming. But I think over the last six</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">months, you know, the 2023 generation of models compared to the 2022 generation has started to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">learn that there may be more subtle things we don't know. And so I kind of suspect, even if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it isn't quite even, that the rising tide will lift all the boats, you know, are we going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">superhuman in some areas and not others? I think it's complicated. I could imagine that we won't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">be superhuman in some areas because, for example, they involve like embodiment in the physical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">world. And then it's like, what happens like the AIs help us train faster AIs and those faster AIs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">wrap around and solve that? Do you not need the physical world? I think the idea that AI systems</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">become more productive and first they speed up the productivity of humans, then they, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of equal the productivity of humans. And, you know, and then they're in some meaningful sense,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the main contributor to scientific progress, that that happens at some point. I think that basic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">logic seems likely to me, although I have a suspicion that when we actually go into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">details, it's going to be kind of like weird and different than we expect, that all the detailed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">models are kind of, you know, we're thinking about the wrong things or we're right about one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo4o09lKAQQ&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">thing and then are wrong about 10 other things.
