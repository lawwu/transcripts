Sax's dream has come true. Tucker Carlson is with us today. You know, Tucker, he was the number one TV host for much of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the past decade, including last year, when shockingly, he was fired from Fox News on April 24. Reason for the firing. It's never been pinned down, but maybe we'll get into it today. And we're going to find out what is motivating a post Fox News Tucker, who has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously launched a show on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. He's done 42 episodes and counting. He's had everybody from Donald Trump, Andrew Tate, Dave Portnoy, and the newly elected president of Argentina on the program. So welcome to the All-in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Podcast, Tucker Carlson.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you for having me. It is it is a legit honor to be here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Two part question to kick us off here. First, have you figured out why you were fired from Fox? And let's get into that a bit. And second, given that you were the number one host for for much of the past decade, and I think probably in the top five highest paid of all time, what's motivating you now? What's the mission here as an independent journalist? Take those two questions in whichever order you like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know why I was fired. I mean, it kind of is an Agatha Christie story. There are like so many suspects, you know what I mean? But I don't know. I was never told I can only speculate. There were a lot of different things going on. I had a lot of opinions that were unpopular, you know, with people who might have influenced my show getting canceled. So I really don't know. I will say, you know, right after it happened, people said, well, how can they fire the top guy? And because that's what it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm certainly not the first high rated host to get fired. It's not only about ratings. There are a lot of different factors. It's a big company you all have worked for and run big companies. And, you know, it's there's a lot of complicated stuff going on. And it's never exactly clear, you know, why things happen the way they do. But I was not shocked by it. I was shocked by it in the short term sense. I didn't expect to have my show canceled that morning. But I was not shocked at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">When I thought about it for a minute, I'd expected that, you know, you can't kind of give the finger to everybody and persist in a in a corporate job. So I no hard feelings. And I and I in fact, I said that on the call when I received the news. It's not my company. And I never felt like I had a right to be on the air. I was I was working at the pleasure of the family that runs the company who treated me very well. And, and, and they wanted me off. And so I was off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Did you ever have moments where somebody taps you on the shoulder and says, advertiser XYZ is getting uncomfortable, or we're trying to land this new advertiser, and right, they want you to shape things in one way? Did you ever feel that pressure? Is that or is that just a thing that is kind of like a boogeyman that doesn't actually exist?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, it will it not only exists, it defines news coverage, especially on pharma. You know, because pharma is the biggest advertiser in television, as I know, you know, and so for sure. I mean, if you know, Pfizer sponsoring your show, you're not going to question the facts. I mean, it's kind of that simple. So absolutely. And of course, that's why they're the biggest advertiser. So they can shape news coverage. I mean, that's, that's the point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But I personally never had a single person say to me, don't say this. That I recall, I haven't thought about it too much. But that certainly I was there 14 years. And I didn't have that experience regularly, or at all really that I can remember. And, and I think, you know, my producers may have been told that, but it didn't ever get to me because I was always really clear, which is, I always said out loud to the supervisors there, you know, I work for your company, I don't own this network.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">All I can control is what I say. If you don't like what I say, don't have me on TV. But as long as I'm on TV, I'm going to say what I think is true. And in a million cases, I said only part of what I think, not because of my employer, but just because you shouldn't actually say everything you think. I mean, I have some crackpot views too. Or I have resentments that I didn't want to work out on the air. I mean, I did, you know, you're straining yourself and you want to, as you do in your personal life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But on no question of principle, did I ever pull back because I just, I wouldn't do that. And again, I was just super clear. If you don't like what I'm saying, take me off the air, but I'm not going to, you know, toe a line. And because I was so clear about that, I just think they didn't think it was worth having some kind of dispute with me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And to their great credit, for the time that I was there, and I said this many times in public, like I took positions on the Ukraine war, on the COVID vaccine, on the COVID lockdowns, among other issues that I think, you know, I've been vindicated on pretty conclusively on the origins of COVID.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of those are super unpopular. On January 6th, which was so hated at the company where I worked that people, a number of people, including on-air people, four that I can think of, resigned in protest over my, over me suggesting that actually it was more complicated than it looked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And there were a bunch of federal agents in the crowd. How can you say that? Are you claiming a false flag? Well, no, not, wouldn't use that phrase, but like, this is something weird going on here. Well, I've been vindicated on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It sounds like I'm bragging. I'm not. I'm just stating factually that I said things that were truly hated by a lot of the people who worked there and they let me keep saying them. So it's kind of hard to complain really, at this point, right? Again, it's not my company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Just from a business standpoint, I think it's weird for a company to fire their top performer and to do so without giving any notes. I mean, if any of us had a superstar executive or a superstar engineer, like a hundred x engineer, working at one of our companies, and like day in and day out, they were, you know, hitting every milestone and crushing it. Like if you had a problem with them, you would give them a note, you would just like try to say, Hey, can we just like it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just think from like a business standpoint, it's so weird. It just seems like self-destructive. And I think it was, I mean, their ratings really cratered in the wake of making this change. Maybe they've come back a little bit, but I don't think it's ever been the same. I just think it's a crazy way to operate a business. So yeah, it's their right. I mean, they can do whatever they want, but I don't understand it as a way of doing business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I don't understand it as a way of living either. I mean, you know, everybody in the course of life, whether as a parent or an employer, or just a friend has to deliver uncomfortable news or disagree with someone that you deal with. And you have a moral obligation to explain the disagreement. You can't just, you know, levy the penalty and leave it at that. You have to explain why you're doing that. And I think that's, it's incumbent on us morally to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I wasn't that mad about it actually, because I know the rules of that particular business, which are really harsh. And I've been in it, you know, my whole life. And so I've seen a lot of people as talented or more talented than I meet bad ends. And, you know, for reasons that I thought were not justified. And I know them all really well. So you work in a business like that, you know what it is. You know, the black car is going to show up at 3am and tow to the Lubyanka. And that's just what it is. You know what I mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't kind of whine about it, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">How much of it was the, you know, this is a family owned business. And the patriarch, obviously, pioneered opinion based, you know, journalism slash entertainment commentary. And the younger ones maybe were on the other side of the political aisle, and maybe were not as I don't know, cutthroat, or maybe didn't share the same philosophy of their dad, what was your relationship like with the new generation with Rupert, et cetera?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And how much did that play into it? Do you think?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, my relationship with the father and son who are directly involved in that company was, from my perspective, very strong. And I will say this about the Murdochs. They're very polite. I mean, they're really kind of very Anglo, almost elaborately polite in a way that I'm not mocking, I'm complimenting. And they're not confrontational, they're not nasty in the way that they deal with people directly. And I prefer that as sort of a way of communicating with people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So I got along with them very, very well. I always liked them. And they were very nice to me, elaborately nice to me, and always gave me assurances of my right to say what I thought was true. And so again, I can only speculate. I will say, though, and you see this with Trump, especially, I don't think I'm anywhere near as divisive as Trump. Obviously, I'm not as powerful as Trump. I'm not the figure Trump is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But one thing that maybe Trump and I have in common is we're really disliked by a certain set of people, affluent people, highly educated people, people who work at NGOs, government, finance, really kind of hate a certain brand of politics. So it's not being conservative. You can be conservative in the sort of, I work at Cato or Heritage, or we need to get back to free trade or whatever, that kind of thing, the Reaganite foreign policy. That's all fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you start asking questions like, well, why doesn't our country act in its own interest? There's something about that that's uniquely offensive to them, to that whole class of people. Now, I could not have more contempt or loathing for those people, having grown up among them. I know how repulsive they are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So their hatred of me, I wear as a badge of honor. It actually makes me happy. But it's hard to take. I would say, I mean, again, I'm just speculating in my specific case, but I know more broadly, like it's very hard to have lunch at the Four Seasons in Jackson during the winter because there's some private equity wife who's going to scream at you on your way to the men's room because that world hates you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you live in that world and you're employing someone like me, you know, you hear about it. I guess that's my point. You hear about it like, what? That guy's a Nazi. What's the deal with that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to actually pull this thread. I would love your perspective on the state of American society, just less on the political spectrum of Republican versus Democrat. But just just observe for us, Tucker, what do you see in American society? Where are we as a society? What has happened? What is happening?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, this isn't an eight hour podcast. I could actually give you my very lengthy theories and views on that. But I will just say one thing that I've been thinking about a lot recently. I just had my college roommate staying at my house. And, you know, we're, of course, the same age, known each other our whole adult lives. He's been very successful and he lives in an enclave of very, very successful people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And and so we're familiar with this culture. And we were talking about American and he's from an immigrant family. So he's got a kind of broader perspective, I would argue, a broader perspective on like America. He's 54, as I am.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And we were talking about how obviously this is not a democracy. It's not even a sort of decent facsimile of a democracy. It's to call it a democracy is like ridiculous, actually. But it's even worse than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Our politics and not just our politics, but our public conversation reflects the very specific and parochial concerns of a tiny, tiny group of people, which is middle aged, affluent women who tend to be very angry and tend to mostly with their husbands, but probably for other reasons, too, and exercise this like wildly disproportionate power over what we can talk about and think about and the rules that the rest of us live by.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just kind of amazing. And he happens to live in Jackson, Wyoming. So and I go there to ski and to fish and I have for a very long time. And I always say to him, I can't go anymore because I yelled at at lunch over my elk chili or in the lift line or whatever, or at the West Side Market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Literally a relative of mine yelled at me while buying bananas in the West Side Market. She lives there. And I'm thinking, what is it about this group of people that hates me so much when again, I know them really well. I'm related in some cases to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So and I'm not quite sure, but I just I see our politics and our concerns, which if you take three steps back are like insanely picky. You like trans black lives matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I never said they didn't. But like if that's your main public policy objective to celebrate trans black lives in a country of 360 million people, it's got a lot of big problems. You are not seeing the whole picture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">What is that? And what it is, again, is the disproportionate influence of a class of people and their neuroses. I wouldn't even say policy concerns, but like there are things they're worried about and their weird personal tics and like the result of years of therapy and SSRIs on their brains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Like that kind of controls our whole conversation. And my friend was saying, because he's really smart, he's like, yeah, but the good news is this can't last because it's just too stupid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And at some point very soon, the country is going to revert to the place that all countries begin, which is in a conversation about things that matter, like who comprises the population.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Do we have enough water? Where are we on energy exactly? How are we going to manage these complex relationships with other countries? Like the things that, you know, the stuff of government, the stuff of resources, of course, resources, but like just the basic questions that should dominate the consciousness of any country and should dominate our public conversation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like our public obsessions are getting increasingly irrelevant, actually. Increasingly, it's like crazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">As our problems get bigger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and the problem gets bigger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The conversation becomes more inane as the problems get bigger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you. Exactly. That's exactly right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you look at that, that cohorts disproportionate impact, and then you translate it, for example, last night, there was, I guess, like a almost riot protest when folks were trying to light the Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center, I guess, and there was like a huge pro Hamas, I think, somebody check me out if this is wrong, protest and then people were pushing back on the cops and all this stuff. And all these folks are trying to do was just like the Christmas tree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you connect the dots? How does that cohort get to?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">No, but it's actually a branch from the same tree, Christmas tree in this case, because that whole conversation, well, I think it's interesting and I think it's geopolitically significant and I've been to those countries and I know people there, so I'm interested in it. And there's a lot to care about and be interested in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But the displacement of all of our public passions onto a conflict in a foreign country, however important that conflict may be, really kind of tells you a lot. It's like, in other words, yeah, I care what's happening between Israel and Hamas. I have views on it, which are probably pretty mainstream views, whatever. I don't have any very interesting views on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's a little weird for your entire country, thousands of miles away, to be so preoccupied with that conflict that they miss big history changing events happening like in their own country. And I think that's, again, a species of the same problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We are unable to, the problems that confront us are so big that we can't deal with them. And actually, my wife and I had this conversation the other night. I was for years a magazine writer and I have to file every Friday. I work for Bill Kristol at the Weekly Standard. And obviously, I regret that. But it was interesting at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And I have to file the story every week. And I'd stay up all night because I'm very lazy and I put stuff off. And I'd stay up every Thursday night, all night. And I had a call. It's going to the printing press in Pennsylvania. This was back when it was in print. And you've got to file it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And right around 8.30 a.m. on Friday morning, I would have this overwhelming urge to rearrange the books on my shelves in my library by title or by subject. I'd have all these weird kind of like librarian fantasies about rearranging books, which on a normal day, like, why would you do that? Better things to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But as my problems mounted and I couldn't write the lead I wanted, I would transfer all my anxiety onto something I felt I could control or that was of lower stakes, less consequence. And I think that's kind of what we're seeing a little bit. We care more about foreign wars and trans lives as the obvious things that hold our society together start to fall apart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you even deal with that? I don't know if I'm being very articulate, but I think that's what's happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It makes actually perfect sense. What do you put on the top of that list of things we should be focused on, Tucker?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I mean, from my perspective, by far the most important...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, if you rank one, two, three, this is what America needs to put its energy on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not even close. National cohesion, and by which I mean something specific. What does the majority of the country have in common with one another? Because look, the arc of the last century's American history is super, super interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have this massive influx of immigration, the Ellis Island generation, late 19th, early 20th century. And it's both good and bad. We only remember the good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But there was a lot of social volatility, like a lot. Like the mayor of Chicago got shot in his house. There was bombings on Wall Street.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Like the whole, the Wobblies, the anarchists, like the foot soldiers that were immigrants, working class European immigrants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And part of the problem was there was a lot of immigrants and I mean, Sacco and Vanzetti, you know, who shot the clerk in, was it Brockton, Mass? Anyway, it was in Massachusetts, Boston.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">They'd been in the country for just a few years and they immediately got sucked into radical politics. Well, why was that? Well, because they weren't kind of bought in or rooted in or hadn't been fully assimilated into American society.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1106" target="_blank">00:18:26.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So then you have the First World War and we basically shut down immigration and we have this period of settling where like all Americans, let's think through our civic religion, what ties us together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then that leads into October of 29 and you do have this national crisis that lasts for more than a decade and we didn't blow up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And we had a successful, you know, the CCC. We like had these big programs, which I'll say this is a conservative, kind of worked in keeping people fed and focused, gave them purpose, kept the country from collapsing during the Great Depression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1135" target="_blank">00:18:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">If that happened now, when there is no broad agreement on what it means to be an American, no agreement at all on what we all have in common, I don't think we can withstand it, actually. I really don't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not even convinced it matters as much what that civic religion is as it does that we have one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">If we don't have anything that ties us together, when that day comes, and you know what I mean, when the economic crisis comes, because it's coming, like what's that going to look like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to be very scary. And so that's what I'm most worried about by far.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you define national cohesion? I guess maybe then like what are the few elements that you think America needs to agree on as a majority?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Wake me up from a deep sleep and ask me what it means to be an American.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then do the same to 1000 other people and we'll just do a survey on it. And do the majority of those people give the same answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And if they don't, like so this is, I mean, I have so many theories, I'm going to control myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But I would just say one other thing, which is we overestimate people's ability to metabolize change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not like a strict Darwinist or anything, but I do sort of believe that over time people adapt to their environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And that in us is, most of our abilities are inborn.

We live in what's supposed to be a big democracy. There's supposed to be a lot of media channels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4269" target="_blank">01:11:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But yet they all enforce a certain narrative on pretty much every issue. But even, you know, again, I'm picking on, I think, one of the biggest issues right now, which is this war we've got going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4281" target="_blank">01:11:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, how does that happen? I don't understand it. How do they maintain that control?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4284" target="_blank">01:11:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">This is one of my personal concerns about technology and about progress of all kinds, which is you don't actually know where it's going. You don't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4292" target="_blank">01:11:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, your best forecaster or mine have very often been wrong. And, you know, of course, the promise of the Internet was diversity and access to information from a lot of different sources, unfiltered information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4304" target="_blank">01:11:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You can talk to people in foreign countries for free. You know, every American will have an encyclopedia at his fingertips and people are gonna be much more informed and no one will be able to control it because it's free and open.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4317" target="_blank">01:11:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And the effect has been, you know, the opposite. There's less, I would argue, there's been less freedom in information than there was 30 years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4328" target="_blank">01:12:08.360</a></span> | <span class="t">How did that happen? I mean, that's, it's a very, I mean, you guys are much better situated to answer that question. Someone should think about that, I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4333" target="_blank">01:12:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But the bottom line is there are just not that many pipelines, actually. You know, in television, there were three big news channels, cable, you know, broadcast kind of receded in importance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4343" target="_blank">01:12:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's mostly about prostate health now. And so there are three big channels, two of them on one side, one was on the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4349" target="_blank">01:12:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there were the social media giants, but there are not that many of them. And they were all locked down and they were all riddled with intel, in some cases, actual salaried intel officers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4360" target="_blank">01:12:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Matt Taibbi's amazing reporting has shown this, not just American either, from foreign countries. The whole thing was an op. It was insane.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4367" target="_blank">01:12:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, you could, I'm not going to beat up on Fox News, but there was a kind of a fairly narrow band of acceptable views allowed on that channel. Is that control? Yes, it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4378" target="_blank">01:12:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there really was no remaining place with scale where someone with a dissenting view could give it voice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4385" target="_blank">01:13:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's just crazy. It's the opposite of what we were promised. But whatever, not to whine about it. But the existence of X, where anyone around the world or in most countries anyway can get for free a whole range of opinions that aren't controlled, that changes everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4402" target="_blank">01:13:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Like the primacy of control of information in a war cannot be overstated. Like that's, you can debate whether it's more important than ammunition, but it's right up there, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4412" target="_blank">01:13:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think this election, if that platform stays free for the next 12 months, you know, I think we have a shot at at least of a real election.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4421" target="_blank">01:13:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But if it does, and I think they're going to do whatever they can to shut it down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4424" target="_blank">01:13:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We also have web-based shows, podcasts, and that even predated a little bit, you know, taking over X.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4431" target="_blank">01:13:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a self-correcting mechanism here. If you feel too controlled, like maybe perhaps you felt or you felt pressure at Fox.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4439" target="_blank">01:13:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't speak for you if you did. Then all of a sudden, Joe Rogan, All In Podcast, whatever, podcasts all emerge and now your show on X, and I'm sure it's going to be on other platforms as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4450" target="_blank">01:14:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you can speak to what you think the impact of a post-Fox Tucker Carlson show will be, and how will you be able to sort of shape the show differently, if at all?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4462" target="_blank">01:14:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's the mission here? That was my first question we never really got to, which is post-Fox, post-money, post-fame.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4469" target="_blank">01:14:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">What is Tucker Carlson's mission statement going forward? What is your goal here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4473" target="_blank">01:14:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Just the same as before, and I should just be extra clear. I wish I could tell harder stories about Fox, you know, forcing me to take some line or other, but they really didn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4483" target="_blank">01:14:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, they didn't want the show anymore, so that kind of tells you. But anyway, the point is, my intent in hosting that show is the same as my intent in hosting the show we're about to launch on X, which is, you know, just do your best to say what you think is true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4498" target="_blank">01:14:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Bring perspectives and information that you don't think are widely covered to a larger audience, and, you know, try and stay firm in that. Admit when you're wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4506" target="_blank">01:15:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, just be honest. It's actually not—it's, you know, I got in this business because I hadn't graduated from college, and my father's like, "It's a pretty pure meritocracy in journalism. You should do it."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4516" target="_blank">01:15:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's also pretty simple. No real skills required. Just be literate, which I was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4521" target="_blank">01:15:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And is the show going to evolve a little bit?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4522" target="_blank">01:15:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">That's it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4523" target="_blank">01:15:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you've been doing this experiment. You've done about 40 episodes or so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4526" target="_blank">01:15:26.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's the way that it already has evolved. So I got laid off in April, and I, you know, I like to fish and bird hunt, so I did a lot of that. And then I was like, "Ugh, I need to do something."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4537" target="_blank">01:15:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've been stuck in a studio for all these, you know, many, many years. I couldn't really go anywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4543" target="_blank">01:15:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And I went—I took seven foreign trips in four months. I just went to all these places where I knew people. I was interested in what was going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4550" target="_blank">01:15:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just found it amazing. Two things I found amazing. One, the view of America, the vantage you get from a foreign country on what's happening in your own is completely different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4559" target="_blank">01:15:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">There's also a lot—the whole world is reshuffling, in my view, after the Ukraine war. February 2022 really did change a lot, particularly with respect to America's place in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4569" target="_blank">01:16:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">That's worth covering. And the second thing I learned once I started putting videos up on X was that it's international.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4576" target="_blank">01:16:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I was just shocked by that. I mean, because think about it. I mean, I'm working for a U.S. news channel. It's one of three U.S. news channels I've worked for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4584" target="_blank">01:16:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">CNN was international, but I was on CNN U.S. So I'm just used to thinking about America being viewed by Americans, having a conversation about this country.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4591" target="_blank">01:16:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I had no experience at all of a big international audience, and that platform has that. And so I was amazed by that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4600" target="_blank">01:16:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we're going to continue to cover the rest of the world. I'm going over to Dubai in February, interviewing a bunch of heads of state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4608" target="_blank">01:16:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's incredible.

There's so much going on. It's like crazy. People—and this is not a political point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4616" target="_blank">01:16:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">This is like a human point that bothers me almost more than anything politically, which is the death of curiosity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4623" target="_blank">01:17:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like people are not curious.

I want to learn more. And it had exactly the opposite. It's like, lull me to sleep with TikTok. Don't tell me more. I don't want to know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4637" target="_blank">01:17:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Just double down on what you already know, what you already believe over and over and over and over again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4640" target="_blank">01:17:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, what is that?
