This one surprised me as well. I ran into a leader who had a sand timer on his desk. He had a reputation for was being very very calm even though he worked inside a very cutthroat culture.</p><p>People loved working for him and he had exceptional results. Was he naturally like this or were there some hacks, some things that he put into practice? And he said that what he would do is every time there was a worrying thought and it wouldn't go away, what he would do is he would go into his office and he would shut the door and he would take this five minute timer and he would flip it over and for five minutes he would focus on nothing but that one worry.</p><p>It sounds like a recipe for anxiety, but as I dug deeper into it what I realized is that there's a lot of science behind this practice. When we have a worrying thought inside our head, we'll tend to try to push it out or compartmentalize it and to basically say, "Hey, I don't have time for you right now.</p><p>I'm focusing on this other thing." When we push things out, what they tend to do is they tend to grow louder.</p></div></div></body></html>
