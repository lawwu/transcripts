There's always a good time to invest in equities. If equities are at an all-time high, I would say to myself, "Hey, there's momentum. I just jump on the bandwagon, invest more in equities." There's some people who do it the opposite, right?</p><p>They say, "Well, if equities are expensive and they're at all-time highs, well, I don't want to invest, right? Equities are going to crash soon." And then equities do crash. And then they say, "No, I don't want to invest because it's way too scary." So you have to almost rewire your mind.</p><p>If equities are at an all-time high, great. Momentum is working. I'm going to keep investing and this thing will keep rolling forever. And then if equities are down, okay, forget about momentum. And now we think valuation. So now we say equities are cheap. So now is a great time to invest too.</p><p>Don't really sweat the volatility. Don't really sweat valuation so much.</p></div></div></body></html>
