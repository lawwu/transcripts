My bad if you don't. - No, no, I've spoken about it in the past. Like, you know, three months, four months of dating Paris for a Drake show, proposed, did the whole thing.</p><p>And I think I have so much, like, you know, love and appreciation for how she was with me, how much she helped me get to a place and see who I really am as a person and get me off that crazy train. And in reality, you know, I wasn't just grown up and adult enough to handle what comes with that.</p><p>And I fucked it up and, you know, took years and years to be able to get to a place where, you know, we don't speak very often anymore, but it's nothing but love. I wish her the best. I want her to be happy in life. And like, it wasn't ever going to work out.</p><p>- How long was the marriage? - Maybe like a year and a half. But for me, like where I'm at now, are you not ready to get married? - I was married. - What? - Just, that marriage just ended recently. - To the game or what? - That marriage just ended recently, dog.</p><p>- Yeah, bro, I'm at the point now-- - How do you give him some advice? He's going through it, bro. - I mean, fuck, bro. I'm at the point now where like, when I fall into love and I get into these relationships, like the heartbreak of ending and who I turn into when it ends is like world ending for me and world shattering, especially when I find somebody who is my best friend, who I do care about so much.</p><p>- That's the hardest part right there. - And when it ends for me, I crumble. Like I turn into a mute. I hold myself up in my room for weeks and months at a time. And I almost like lose in my brain, like how to even be myself or be a real person.</p><p>So like right now, it's very shaky thing for me and something that I want to steer clear from to the point where like, man, even when I'm on tour and you go to a party and there's 200 girls there and 30 or 40 of the boys, like I'm not interested really in the chase.</p><p>Like, well, I've talked to some people here and there and like have a fun night every now and then. But like, I'm not in that dog era, dog mentality anymore. Like I want to be around my friends. - How did he get over that? - Me and him got over it.</p><p>- I mean, I think- - You got over it? - I think more than anything, I think more than anything, bro. - You are the biggest capper ever. - It takes time, right? It takes time and like, you know, I really didn't get over it until I got around Drake and the boys and the crew, which for me, I have to go to a place where I know I'm the safest, I know I'm the happiest.</p><p>- How the fuck did that get you out of being a dog? - I mean, not necessarily. Like I just, when you get into a relationship and you see what a vibe is with somebody and what the end goal of the game- - Oh, so being with Drake and then how does that make you want to be a dog anymore?</p><p>- I mean, 'cause I just don't care to do it, bro. When you catch a vibe with somebody and you're in a relationship with somebody and you see and have a future trip or a future vision of what you want your life to be and see a piece of yourself in the future.</p><p>Like, I think we all want kids eventually. I think we all want family eventually. You're not running. You see these guys running around in the streets till they're 45, 50 years old. That's not a life that looks enticing to me. - That part is scary. So you obviously deal with heartbreaks tough.</p><p>Like you said, you hole up in the room. How long does it take for you to like feel like a full like person? - Bro, this last one was the toughest one I've ever dealt with. You know, still even having shutters and instances at times where I'm still dealing with it.</p><p>And you know, I think for me, like I said, I had to go to, I had to go sit at this high for five days and like sit in the places that I know to my core make me the happiest. I had to go to Toronto and go to Drake's and to hang out and sit in the studio and listen to music and go to one of their parties where they're playing nothing but old Drake slappers and things that I would do when I was in my dorm room in college.</p><p>I have to call my sister every day. I have to call my mom and my dad and tap into my family and like really slowly find a way to try and get it, you know, out of my head. And I think there's certain points in time where I have to go really hard drinking and fucking around to get my mind off it.</p><p>And slowly but surely as I'm around good people and I'm around the right people, my perspective starts to shift and I realize really deep down that as much as that did mean to me, there are other things in my world and in my life that have meant as much or more to me that like the music, right, with Drake.</p><p>Like I would not go to sleep when an album would drop. I would sit in my dorm room and memorize every word and write it down on a piece of paper until I knew every song of the whole album. - Do you feel like-- - Wait, how are you doing?</p><p>Are you doing okay with your heartbreak? - Yeah, man. - You okay? - I'm doing okay. - How do you handle it? He goes to Drake's house, goes to the studio. - I go to the gym, dog. I go lift some weights. - Yes, sir. - Go get some shots up.</p><p>- On your end, you kick it. - Hang out with my dog. - Yes, sir. - Kick it. Do you, is the relationships ending because you are breaking up with this girl or she's catching you do some wild stuff and she's in? 'Cause I feel like if you, if you break up with a girl, that means you're pretty much over it.</p><p>But if she breaks up with you or catches you doing some wild stuff and she breaks up with you, that's when it can be like tough. - Oh, that's different. If he breaks up with you, that's gotta hurt you. - Are you in these relationships? - No, no, I'm really not.</p><p>I haven't been very much of the past of like an ender of the relationship very much. Like when I go after somebody and I get in a relationship with somebody, like I'm in it for the long haul and it's what I want and I know it's what I want.</p><p>But like, you know, I think for me in my life, throughout times, like especially last year, like, you know, as I'm getting back into the public eye and I'm doing the podcast and I'm doing more interviews and the Netflix stuff and everything I've done, you know, it brings a lot of daily interaction with certain people that are usually all positive.</p><p>But for sometimes for me, like I look back on everything with an immense amount of like shame and like, damn, I'm sitting there on Sundays watching Lamar and like all these guys that I've played with and against and stuff and I'm seeing what could have been if I would have been in a different place.</p><p>So I think for me, like last year, like I think I just ride through a wave of depression at times. And when that wave comes, I'm not myself. Like I'm not the fun flowing, energy filled, talk shit, have fun kind of guy. And it puts me in a little bit of a hole.</p><p>And for me, that comes with sitting on the couch, staying at home more, don't really want to leave or go out or go to dinner. And like, you know, this relaxed relationship, I was the happiest I could have ever been just being with her and vibing at the house or just doing things solo one-on-one.</p><p>- Why'd she break up with you? - I mean, because I feel like I was just, I wasn't myself, right? I wasn't taking care of the relationship the way that I should, wasn't taking care of myself the way that I should. - Don't you feel like a good woman when you're in those places of like not being yourself, they should be able to see that and try to help you work through that.</p><p>- And that's a lot of it too, right? I think it got to a point where she was like, yo, I'm giving you everything I have. I'm giving you unconditional love. I'm giving you everything that I possibly can, chances and chances to try and like, yo, snap out of this, be yourself, be the person that I fell in love with.</p><p>And for me, it was just like really stuck. And like, you know, my mind and energy and effort was like all focused on it. I'm aware that it's going on, but like I couldn't get myself out of it. And, you know, tough man, tough. You know, this is a person I definitely saw and envisioned spending a lot in the rest of my life with.</p><p>And, you know, I look back at it now and it's taken me a lot of time and perspective shift to just be like, you know what? At the end of the day. You could call me five years down the road and be like, yo, I miss you. I love you.</p><p>Let's try and make this work again. And I would drop everything in my life for everything that I was doing to be able to do that. Tell her you're in a better place. You might as well. I mean, bro, I want her to be happy, right? And whatever she's doing in her life and whatever she's doing, I wish the best for her.</p><p>If it's happy with somebody else or happy being on her own or whatever it is, like I'll always be there in any way that I can be and doing whatever I can be. But, you know, I don't want to sit and squeeze my way into a situation or try and make things messy because, you know, if it's meant to be, it'll come back, right?</p><p>If it's not, it's the most love for me ever. And I don't think I handled things the right way whenever things ended. I think I really pressed and tried to make it work and, like, you know, just kind of lost my marbles a little bit to the point of where I would have done anything to make it work.</p><p>And maybe it wasn't meant to be at that time. So, you know, for now, I have other things to focus on and other things to try and do to keep my mind off it and to just try and just keep going.</p></div></div></body></html>
