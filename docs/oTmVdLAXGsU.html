That's how we pursue our happiness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTmVdLAXGsU&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'd add one more thing to that. Compare Christ to whatever else it is that you treasure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTmVdLAXGsU&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what is it that you really want? Is it love? Is it you want to be loved?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTmVdLAXGsU&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that can come across in various ways, a sexual addiction, a desire for fame.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTmVdLAXGsU&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are really varieties of wanting to be loved. Is it acceptance? Is it money? Is it power? Is it comfort?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTmVdLAXGsU&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now compare that thing you dream of and love with Christ. Which is better?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTmVdLAXGsU&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Does pornography offer you the satisfaction, acceptance and love that Jesus does?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTmVdLAXGsU&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Does money offer you anything in comparison to the riches of Christ?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTmVdLAXGsU&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Does passing temporal power offer you anything in comparison to what Christ is offering?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTmVdLAXGsU&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you see how much better Christ is than those other things you go running after,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTmVdLAXGsU&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you will choose Christ rather than those things, and you'll walk away from them with freedom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTmVdLAXGsU&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Wonderful, Michael.
