And it's also not to say that then if we discover you have one of these disorders, then can we use mouth tape to help with the treatment process, that you're also being treated for this and using mouth tape, you can absolutely do that as well.</p><p>There's just a concern, 'cause some people are now just blindly taking these steps without knowing that they might be doing some harm.</p></div></div></body></html>
