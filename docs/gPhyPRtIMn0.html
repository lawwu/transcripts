href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So fourth thing so we can get all the way so you can all understand what I'm talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Customer experience at

| <span class="t">So we have more than $26 billion that runs on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So talk with LangChain like, hey, you're not joking here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So there is a lot of implications for that and everything on customer experience is meant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to maximize the value that the

target="_blank">00:01:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have the typical land, adopt, expand and renew framework that everybody has on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.300</a></span> | <span class="t">industry to go there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.980</a></span> | <span class="t">That is the process that we go through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But when you talk about any company, there is always process, people and technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">In those kind of conferences, a lot of people think about the technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a lot of hype but they always come together with the teams that implement that and the process</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that goes with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So I meant to start with this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have land, adopt, expand and renews and actually there are people and organizations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that goes for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have a customer success organization that actually is in charge or when someone acquires</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">something from Cisco, buy a product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">There is an adoption team that makes sure that you adopt whatever you buy for, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And there is an organization that is renews to make sure that when the end of the term</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">comes, you are happy enough to actually renew your subscription.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And usually more often than not, during that period, we expand our relationship with the customer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">There is obviously technical support, which a lot of you match to this, and other organizations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">like implementation, service delivery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm talking about 20,000 people organization north of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a lot of things that could be improved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And from that lens, what you're doing is adopting AI to help us, not only on optimizing the process,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but optimizing for people and maximize their returns to the business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's a very important thing because if you look on the left hand of this slide, I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about how we make customer experience unimaginable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And by that, I'm going to hyper-personalization, proactive and predictiveness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But we are not talking about agentic AI overall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't come out of the blue and like, hey, agentic AI is a new thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">We start with machine learning predictive AI models over a decade ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So treat very well your data science team because they're going to be critical now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">When it comes from the LLMs, Gen AI, which are very good for everything that has to do with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.540</a></span> | <span class="t">interactions on language, there is an L on the middle of this for a reason, LLM is really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">bad for predictions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you bring this together, we can have multiple agents that go for workflows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So with that said, our vision and the future of Cisco customer experience, and you have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">leading on this for over two years now, and a lot of companies are coming to help understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">how we're doing this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's part of the reason why in this conference on the very strong partnership we have with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and Harrison and his team, we are going for using agentic AI to elevate CX to become an agentic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.860</a></span> | <span class="t">CX by providing personalized, predictive and proactive experience to all of our customers, together, not separate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Hyper-personalization, how we can predict fails before they happen, how it can be proactive of field notice, or even best practice that goes there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We are leveraging multi-agents. By multi-agents, you're going to see on the next slide what I mean by that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">There's human and machine type of agents, Gen AI, and traditional AM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">We are providing services that goes for users that call them, like you can call on a video call, on a chat interface, or a phone call, or to have a tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And the agentic CX provides a lot of embedded value, like advanced technical support, predictive intelligence operations, and all of this is meant to help customers to have recommendations that are proactive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we want to avoid them to face an issue, if we can, upfront.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.340</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to give them predictive insights, and make this hyper-personalized foresight on a sense that every customer should have an agent on themselves, which has context for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So, context is a very important thing for us, and we are going beyond what we call about MCP context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.540</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a big thing that is out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">With that said, let me go, now that you're all PhD, what we do at Cisco, let me talk a little bit about use cases, and why we are drive from a use cases approach, as opposed to a tools approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, just sharing an experience for here, when you start about a year and a half ago, obviously, GPT was the big name in town, and everybody was trying to try, GPT 3.0 was really bad back then, but it still was novel, right, completely novel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But, before we have everybody trying to do a chatbot for whatever reason there was, so the first thing is, before we even go to the use cases, we define the criteria that would make the use case belong in the first place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, we have an advisory part of our services, we enter a customer that the customer had 412 use cases for AI, and when you talk with them, it ends up being five that actually collaborate to the business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, boy, this is less than 10%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we define that criteria to say, any use case that we do on customer experience, remember, it's 20,000 people organization, there's a lot of creative people and a lot of ideas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=395"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">How did you do that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let me go a little, explain how the agentic flow works for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, here's a question, typical question for the renews person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">What's the upcoming renew status for customer X, Y, Z, and the actions required to minimize its potential risk?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a very fair question, but if you think about it, I need to know what's the customer, then I need to know what products the customer bought,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I need to know what dates these products were bought, so I can get the circle of renews.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I need to understand what the current status is, and I need to map all the signals for the risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And if the customer has multiple products, he may be happy with the product A and not happy with the product B.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And the renews may be compromised or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there is a lot of signals and intelligence that goes from that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, having a single agent for this was not ideal, because you don't get to the accuracy level that we are targeted to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we needed to go before supervisor was a thing on the Harrison this morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">We came with a supervisor approach, which is basically receives the NLP and decomposes the NLP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And because the question is about a renews question, it hits the renews agent immediately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Then the renews agent gets the context, and then he calls himself the adoption agent and the delivery agent to understand what's the status of the customer now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I can answer half of the question on the pipeline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see this on the demo, on the Langsmith and all the traces going, and how we decompose the questions there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we can learn and leverage some of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's active in parallel behind the scenes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Not 100% autonomous yet, because we still have human in the loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But sentiment analysis is something that I can trigger any time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.760</a></span> | <span class="t">If there is a question, I can proactively go and trigger the sentiment analysis and all the signals and come back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, this customer hates us on that product, he loves us, or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the same time, I want to make sure what is the install base that this customer has.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Is a competitive guide into this, because we open a breach, we are too expensive, or we miss a functionality, whatever that is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I'm talking about Cisco, but I appreciate the fact that a lot of you have a similar scenario on your products,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.760</a></span> | <span class="t">especially if you have recurrent revenue and a lot of things that goes on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, then when you get out of the first part of the question, and you get the real focus on customer experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Add customer experience on any company is all about workflows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">A support ticket follows a workflow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">A renewal process follows a workflow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Adoption follows a workflow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you think about this, LLMs are not very good on workflows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">They are good on language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">They are not metadata.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">They are trained on information that goes there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">When you do a genetic with a tool like LangGraph platform, it helps a lot with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we went on this, and we go to workflows, and if the second part of the question is about risk, I hit a predicted machine learning model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Why?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it's very deterministic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">DLLM is very probabilistic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we combine it both to get to the accuracy level, and we leverage the length change to make context carrying back and forward, and LLMs to trace it back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Going to the point that we receive the answer, we do the final reasoning formatting, and answer it back to the internal user.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, you can go deeper on this, and I don't have time for that, but I want to share you something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">This, our CX Agentic AI in action, I have seven agents on that example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Over time, we may decompose them on some other agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">That's okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The point of Agentic AI, a lot of people think about agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">For us, it's less about the agent itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It's more about the flexibility for the workflow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Think about this example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.760</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a question, how can I maximize the value for what I've invested in Cisco in the last two years?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a very fair question, but it's meant for an external customer, not an internal user.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Same agents, different workflow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">How can I dynamically change this for the understanding?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">That's how the power of the supervisor and dynamic agents goes from there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1022" target="_blank">00:17:02.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you can see the agentic power coming in reality, and this is running in production.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you have time, I recommend you to go in the booth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You have Vince and Amand that presented yesterday, myself and others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">That's going to show how we're running this on environment in production.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.760</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">We use multiple models, as I said, deployment on-prem and on the cloud.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And a predictive machine learning pipeline using predicted models on ML integrated with LLMs to accomplish the results that we want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">With that said, I want to wrap this conversation, share with you some key learnings and takeaways that we went through that process for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, first thing that I would recommend you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">As I mentioned before, please define the use cases and the metrics first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't jump on the bandwagon because there is a new tool on the weekend because next weekend is going to have a new one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1077"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It's amazing to be on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But at the same time, if you define the use case, it's much better for you to measure it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">At the same time, rags, prompts, field shots, supervised fine-tuning chains come after you have the use case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1098" target="_blank">00:18:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a reason for them to access.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1100"

production, they have different metrics than the experimentation team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1117" target="_blank">00:18:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The experimentation team has a latitude and degree of freedom to try and fail and fail fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1123" target="_blank">00:18:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So use that and have a dedicated team for evaluation too.</span></div><div

the evaluation team to have the golden data sets and be able to say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPhyPRtIMn0&t=1139"
