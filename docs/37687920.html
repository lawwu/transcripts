class="t">So they are getting, they are, their thinking is getting so much more integrated as they move from Challenge 2 to Challenge 3.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37687920/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2994" target="_blank">00:49:54.340</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">And so you'll find that, I, I find that one of the things you want to be on the lookout for in Challenge 3 is the exposition strand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37687920/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=3009" target="_blank">00:50:09.240</a></span> | <span

class="t">And so they'll say poetry till the end and like try to like rush writing some poetry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37687920/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=3017" target="_blank">00:50:17.620</a></span> | <span

href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37687920/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=3024" target="_blank">00:50:24.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And so trying to look ahead and say, hey, student of mine, who I love so much, could you, let's make a schedule to ensure that we're including poetry in our writing and about the beauty of words and how we can reflect God's goodness in the words that we're choosing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37687920/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=3040" target="_blank">00:50:40.260</a></span> | <span

href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37687920/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=3043" target="_blank">00:50:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the U.S. History book is really thick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37687920/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=3046" target="_blank">00:50:46.440</a></span> | <span

class="t">It's so full of great information, but maybe looking into an audio book version for that so that there can be days of maybe more restful reading versus more of like the highlighting and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37687920/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=3058" target="_blank">00:50:58.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe being able to balance that will help them just be able to integrate into that, that Challenge 3 U.S. history strand a little bit better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37687920/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=3066" target="_blank">00:51:06.200</a></span> |

class="t">So I just in terms of just that simplification of preparation as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37687920/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=3292" target="_blank">00:54:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, as classical educators, we are looking at, you know, the whole purpose is building virtue, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37687920/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=3297" target="_blank">00:54:57.540</a></span> | <span class="t">We're trying to build virtue in us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="t">And so, and the, we are thinking about building virtue in our kids, but we're really also building virtue in ourselves at the same time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37687920/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=3306" target="_blank">00:55:06.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if we step back and we look at the preparation and say, how, how do I want to see virtue arise in my community through, not like we said, not just academics, but in general, but academics are an amazing way where virtue is built.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37687920/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=3321" target="_blank">00:55:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But that is, that is my goal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37687920/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=3324" target="_blank">00:55:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what I'm shooting for is building that virtuous human being that's going to be able to shine the light of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37687920/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=3329" target="_blank">00:55:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And so all of these things are just, just tools for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37687920/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=3333" target="_blank">00:55:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if we keep that in mind, then our focus for the goals that we make becomes much more clear as we continue to, as we continue to work toward that.</span></div><div class="c"><span
