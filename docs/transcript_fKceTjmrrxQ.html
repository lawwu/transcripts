You mentioned your bag got stolen, you've gotten mugged, something like that. And like, why didn't that stop you from travel? When I think so many people, that's their fear that something bad would happen. And if it does happen, they might not wanna travel again.</p><p>I have to assume it's happened to you and you've kept going. - Yeah, you know, I got stabbed in Columbia. Um, and my mother always sends me like, every State Department warning about Mexico. But it's like, hey, like we live in the States. People get gunned down going to Walmart, right?</p><p>There are mass shootings all the time in this country. Bad things happen, it's just part of life. It doesn't matter if you're home, or in Mexico, or in Thailand, or in Paris, or Japan, shit happens. And so what, you know, you can live in fear and say, I'm just gonna never go anywhere.</p><p>But then you walk across the street to a movie theater and then, you know, make it out because it's a psychopath. Or you get hit by a car on your way to work, you know? So it's like, are you really gonna live in the fear of a, you know, every what if?</p><p>If so, then like, never leave your house. - If you're up for it, I'd love to hear the story in Columbia, and maybe from the perspective of, I think a lot of people don't really plan for that. And so they don't know what they would do in that circumstance.</p><p>And I imagine, you know, you're here now, so it all went well. What kind of happened, and how did you know what to do, and where did you end up going, and how did the trip unfold after that? - Yeah, I was in Bogota, and I had my phone out, and long story short, you shouldn't have fancy electronics out.</p><p>And I just forgot to put it back in before I left this cafe. And so I tried to take it, and he jerked backwards instead of just going forward. And so like, we started tussling. And then, yeah, he had a small little knife. I thought he was just punching me.</p><p>I mean, if he had like shown the knife, I would've been like, "Yo, take the phone." But afterwards, you know, I was like, "Oh, so sorry." And I was just covered in blood. It's 'cause like- - I assume you went to the hospital, and everything was fine? - Yeah, the whole thing cost me like 50 bucks.</p><p>Honestly, like I, you know, the flight home was like a thousand bucks, and I have to reimburse me for that. But the, you know, the 50 bucks, I was like, "That's not worth the paperwork." I mean, they could've done it for the 50 bucks, but I did it for the flight.</p><p>- Would you go back to Bogota after that? - Oh, yeah, 100%. I love, love Bogota. I was really sad to have to go home. - Yeah, I've also been to Bogota, and I think especially, I mean, it's just a great place. Like, I love the country of Columbia.</p><p>I've been there a few times. Bogota is close enough, and no, you know, time zone good enough that I think you could even do it in a long weekend and have a great trip. Not that, I don't wanna, you know, not do slow travel, but I think for those who don't have the time to do it, it's still a place that you can go in a short period of time because of the proximity.</p><p>- It's such a phenomenal place. I was there for six weeks, and I'm gonna stay in another six weeks.</p></div></div></body></html>
