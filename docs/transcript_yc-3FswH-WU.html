Every time I focused and avoided distractions, it's made a huge impact. I think that everyone assumes that there's this power law in the world that you are a passive participant in.</p><p>You're either going to catch one of the power law winners or you're going to lose it. Therefore, you've got to portfolio your way to a power law, to catch a power law. I don't give a shit about that because I think my job in life is to make the power law and to make that outcome.</p><p>And I feel like that has made a huge impact on how I think about life. Every time I've tried to act on it, it's actually paid back significantly. So focus is the biggest piece of advice I've gotten that I think matters. Seven samurai. Akira Kurosawa did such an amazing job representing this ethos, I think.</p><p>You strike and you strike perfectly and you strike with full force and with all your energy and everything you have, your whole character, everything, and you can accomplish incredible things.</p></div></div></body></html>
