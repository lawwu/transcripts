But now it's 2030, you've solved all the real problems. What happens next? What are we doing with a superhuman God? I actually get nervous when someone says, what are you going to do with the superhuman AI?</p><p>We've learned a lot of things over the last 150 years about markets and democracy and that societies work out norms and what they value in this complex and decentralized way. How do we make things good? Most people, most groups, most ideologies that started with like, let's sit down and think over what the definition of the good life is.</p><p>I think most of those have led to disaster. So this vision you have of a market-oriented system with AGI, like what is each person has their own AGI? Like, what does that mean? I don't know. I don't know what it looks like, right? We need to solve the important safety problems and the important externalities.</p><p>Which again, those could be just narrowly about alignment. Subject to that, we should think about what's worked in the past. And I think in general, unitary visions for what it means to live a good life have not worked out well at all.</p></div></div></body></html>
