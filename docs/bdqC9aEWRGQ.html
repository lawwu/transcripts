an unbelievable career with us, and he really put the Nuggets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdqC9aEWRGQ&t=122"

from a team,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdqC9aEWRGQ&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and, you know, that
