So how it all started. I was reading a book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">about Donald Trump re-election and since, as you can hear, I'm not from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">United States, there was a few too many characters to me.

I built a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.820</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit of an AI companion application. It looked terrible, but it gave me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">context for the people that were on the page with a little bit. It found the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">images for them and gave me a little bit of a summary in the context of the of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.060</a></span> | <span class="t">page that I was at. And a month later, it turned into something different. So this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be the Snow Queen. This is one of the first experiences we've built. This is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">the Snow Queen book, and this is the part where the sorcerer's parentheses are flying away</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">with the mirror that distorts the reality. So all right. So it tells a story about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.820</a></span> | <span class="t">flying and flying and the heaven is so far away. There's music and it reads, but you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">can't go into your time story. But then the crash happens and the mirror shutters and it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">distorts everything all around. So this is one of the first experiences we've built. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.820</a></span> | <span class="t">it's all in Polish, so I want to actually demonstrate one that we built just for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">conference that's in English. This is 1984. And what's interesting here, which I don't think I'll be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">to show you, is that you can send a quick voice note to the book and ask what's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">on in this scene right now. I don't really have audio. But the point is that there's many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">different AI voice assistants, but they are almost always just terrible, if not all of them, to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">be honest, serious terrible. We had a demo from Google yesterday. They were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">saying up front that it works 50 percent. It's usually there's a delay. They start talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in the wrong position. I mean, at the wrong time. Then they interrupt you. So we built here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a system where you hold it as to just specify when you are speaking and then you let it go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And it immediately, 100 milliseconds, responds to you. And then you could scroll further and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">then ask a question like, "What happened between the last time I asked a question and now," and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it can summarize what's going on. So you have to believe me that. You can check later on bookgenius.net.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Another thing that we were thinking about is the search. That's a very common thing, searching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So the most normal search would be just exact search. But if you want to -- the way our brains</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't work, they don't memorize the pages. So if you want to find a scene where Winston</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">met O'Brien, then exact search is not going to work. But embeddings work. So you can quickly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">find the scene you were thinking about this way. And then you can go to that -- go to that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">spot, read a bit more. And you can go back to the place where you were reading. But there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">also one step forward -- I mean, one more thing you can do. You can basically say, "Talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">all the way the party propaganda works." And you can do deep research. And it's going to actually read the whole book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">point that you finished at to give you the answer. So it's very useful. It's going to take a couple minutes. I'm going to go back to presentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So I started with VibeCoding, Vanilla.js, very confusing code. But it gave me the freedom to iterate very quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You basically don't know what you don't know. And if you start to -- especially right now, the time it takes to plan</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">everything up front is often wasted. Because you can much quicker just tell your thinking to the AI and generate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">something that works. And then you see, "Oh, that's actually not that great. Let's try this and that." And I realized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that throwing away code that you poured your heart into often feels terrible. Like, you're invested. You've spent so much time. But throwing away</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">code written by AI actually feels great. So I would describe this as waves of changes. So basically, once I start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">feeling that I don't rewrite the whole code base day after day, like the amplitude of the waste is getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">lower and lower. And there comes a time where I can start old-school engineering. I can start getting tests and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">refactor. But there are traps to refactoring. Do I refactor the worst piece of code? I would suggest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that it's better to focus on no hanging fruits. So for example, I had a piece of a code from OpenAI audio</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">processing. And it's like JavaScript, very quickly written, no types, very confusing. But I never have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to touch it. So I'm not refactoring it. Although it was very tempting. So we often think about refactoring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">by adding this. How bad? How painful? How easy? But if something is very bad and very easy to change, but it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">painful at all. And it's probably not a good idea to change it. So I would suggest that it's better to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">look at how bad the code is multiplied by how painful and multiplied by how easy. And when all those factors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">are taken into consideration, then it starts making sense to make a decision. So a lot of the AI experiences</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that we see and talk about are basically either chat GPT wrappers or image generators or half-working</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">useless voice assistants, including Siri. So our approach was to hide the AI from the user.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we produce the books, the AI does the initial draft and we do the rest. And I would argue that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">human touch is invaluable in situations like this. AI cannot tell if the music that it generated isn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">good. It cannot say if the graphics are good-looking or if the avatar is actually matching the vibe of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">person that the book is talking about. So we want to make the AI disappear. And multiple things connected</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">together, simple things, simple building blocks, make for the magical experience for the reader. There's nothing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">really new here. You could already ask a friend a question about the book, but is your friend available</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">24/7 and all-knowing? Probably not. You can already search, but is the search the spoiler-free search?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it natural language search or exact match? So I think that beautiful graphics help you get into the mood</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of the book and help you with the character recall. And music that matches the scene makes it the experience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like watching a movie. And we know that music influences the emotions hugely. And it's very nice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">when you're reading the book and the music just flows with the book and gives you this great experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So nothing new, but at the same time completely new, which is what AI allows us to do nowadays. And I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">encourage everyone to think about those tiny little niches where we can create some completely new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">experiences on top of something that we have known for such a long time. So in thousands of years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it was never possible to read books like this or even really produce books like this. Because if I had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to do all those graphics and music for every single book, it would cost me, I don't know, $100,000 per book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So it never made sense to do this. So how do we do this? The process is we use a combination of LLMs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to the scene analysis, book characters detection. We give the AI an overall music theme. So we say for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Sherlock Holmes books, for example, that it's like Victoria London and all that, and it should be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">norm music and kind of on a sad node. So with scene analysis plus mood detection, we do music generation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and we also destructured XML with metadata. So for example, we have a text like this, and AI is very good at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">doing this kind of a mapping, which then is very easy for us to use in the book when we say, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we can display the avatars that are in the scene. It would be very time consuming for a person to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">through the whole book and map every single thing like this. So today we are open sourcing the player,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">so anyone can create the Netflix-style experiences for books. And if you want AI that feels like magic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">not like chatbots, come talk to me. We build AI experiences that ship in the light and not slides,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcka7rzcxLk&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">although I hope the slides were nice. So thank you, and you can find me at those places.</span></div></div></body></html>
