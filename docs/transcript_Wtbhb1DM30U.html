Was it when you were pretty young or was it in more recent years? - So I wanted to become a psychiatrist. I wanted to, I thought of it as kind of engineering the human mind by sort of manipulating it.</p><p>I thought that's what I thought of psychiatry is by using words to sort of explore the depths of the mind and be able to adjust it. But then I realized that psychiatry can't actually do that. And modern psychiatry is more about sort of bioengineering is drugs. And so sort of, I thought that the way to really explore the engineering of the mind is the other side is to build it.</p><p>And that's also when C++ really became the cool hot thing. So I learned to program at 12 and then never look back hundreds of thousands of lines later. Just, I love program. I love building. And that's to me is the best way to understand the mind is to build it.</p><p>(upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music)</p></div></div></body></html>
