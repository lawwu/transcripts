Like I said earlier, you have to look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">around and what's there. There's a new kind of cadre or cohort of consumer looking healthcare</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">clinics, primary care.

But imagine you had a terrible headache and it was like, "Oh my God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm incapacitated."

I think you should always have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=2064" target="_blank">00:34:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a glass of water around and you should always be, you shouldn't be chugging, you should be drinking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=2068" target="_blank">00:34:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the part two to that is alcohol.

But the truth is you should not eat things in a package. If it's in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=2278" target="_blank">00:37:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a package, it's probably processed and probably not the greatest thing for you, almost impossible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=2283" target="_blank">00:38:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to do that.

If it's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=2289" target="_blank">00:38:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of ingredients, uh, probably not good.

So, if you've smoked 10 packs a day... I'm sorry, one pack a day for 10 years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=3588" target="_blank">00:59:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you have a 10-pack year history.

So, the question is, if you did her diet, like let's just say you followed her diet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=3670" target="_blank">01:01:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and said, "Okay, doc, I'm going to do that.

If you can't do that with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=3720" target="_blank">01:02:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">diet, then you need to be on something. You need to be on a statin, sadly. And if you are so adamant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=3726" target="_blank">01:02:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">about taking statins, which is basically there's a lot of different kinds, but there's an HMG-CoA</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=3731" target="_blank">01:02:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">reductase inhibitor, but that's the fancy name for the molecule.

If you could find a way to put that in a soup and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=3742" target="_blank">01:02:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">eat it every day, you could lower your cholesterol, your LDL that way. So, I think that whenever you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=3747" target="_blank">01:02:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">find out something's abnormal, you have to think about, "Okay, intervention, retest, intervention,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=3752" target="_blank">01:02:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">retest.

So $500 a year is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=4114" target="_blank">01:08:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">0.5% of your income."

So I think there's some consolidation in that space, but I think you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=4373" target="_blank">01:12:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">have to be really clear on what drives this doctor.

Doing that research, I read an article about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=4384" target="_blank">01:13:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple sclerosis this morning.

Just heads up and I'm tracking this." Nothing to do here, but maybe in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=4392" target="_blank">01:13:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a year or two, there'll be some interesting developments. And by the way, we talked about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=4395" target="_blank">01:13:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">all these costs. If your company has an FSA plan, you could put money in pre-tax each year and be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=4402" target="_blank">01:13:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">able to use that for your medical expenses. So one way... And I haven't really thought through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=4408" target="_blank">01:13:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this completely before.

You can't change it mid-year. So one way to force yourself to have a health budget</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=4416" target="_blank">01:13:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is to just commit to put a little bit more in your FSA each year. So maybe say, "This year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=4422" target="_blank">01:13:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to put $2,000." And obviously, we're going to be recording this in January. So it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=4425" target="_blank">01:13:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a little late for this year. But next year, you could say, "I'm going to put $2,000 or $3,000 in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=4429" target="_blank">01:13:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">my FSA." You do have to use it or lose it. Usually, maybe you could roll over, I think this year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=4435" target="_blank">01:13:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">$650. But it'll force you to try to get more serious about these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=4440" target="_blank">01:14:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if you're listening to this and you're like me, at least, it's really hard to be like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnUri4QMNKA&t=4445" target="_blank">01:14:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, do I want to do this test?
