It's a zero annual fee card. It earns 3% back on groceries, 3% back on online retail, and 3% back on gas. Each of those individual categories is only on the first $6,000 a year. And then after that, it is a 1% card.</p><p>The signup bonus right now is $200 on 2,000 spend in six months. There's a 0% intro APR for 12 months. That signup bonus hasn't been higher since 2022. And there aren't a lot of perks on this card. $7 a month towards your Disney bundle. And it also has a 2.7% foreign transaction fee.</p><p>Given that there are cards out there that like the Robinhood card that are 3% on everything, and there are plenty of cards that are going to reward you 3X points or 3% back or more on groceries and gas. And the online retail category is only up to $6,000 a year.</p><p>So are the others. This card is not that exciting to me. Yes, it's a no annual fee card, but you're not getting access to membership rewards. You're not earning that much. This card for me, I'm going to put in the C tier. It's just not something that I'm going to be excited to be using on any regular basis.</p></div></div></body></html>
