So, he was kind enough to already introduce us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=21" target="_blank">00:00:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I'm the CEO. Matthew was the first person who joined us. If you have any difficult questions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=25" target="_blank">00:00:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">please direct it towards Matt. If you think about the three major categories of software</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">engineering, at least as we see it, there's three things that show up to me. The system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.780</a></span> | <span class="t">design, where you think about how do you actually architect a system. A lot of the talks we saw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in this track have been about that in some sense at a high level. Second is actually developing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">software, putting in the business logic of your particular company and all of the DevOps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that comes with it. And then when your software actually hits production, invariably it's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.020</a></span> | <span class="t">to break and then troubleshooting of these production incidents. At the heart of it, those are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the three things interspersed with each other as you think about developing production-grade</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.460</a></span> | <span class="t">software. Now, what's been happening with the magic of AI software engineering tools like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Cursor or Windsor or GitHub Copilot and many more others, the part around development is getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">narrowed. That's the part we're relying on all these different systems to do it for us and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">increasingly so. Over the next year, I'd say more and more of what we see is going to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.580</a></span> | <span class="t">the development part of it really seamless. The question is what happens to the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">two parts of this entire software engineering workflow? The first one being system design</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and the other one being troubleshooting. Now, what is the promise that is, as we think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">what software engineering could look like, is that we'll get to focus on just the most high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">impact and creative work that happens in engineering, which is system design. So, we're hoping that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.700</a></span> | <span class="t">AI will write our code for us and also troubleshoot all the production incidents. So, we just get to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.940</a></span> | <span class="t">focus on the fun stuff, which is the creative work of how we put all these different pieces together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.300</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the hope. I actually think that to make that happen, there's something missing, right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">which is the problem of troubleshooting. How do you automate that part of it? And I think if we just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">continue in the way we're going, it's actually going to look at the opposite. It's that most of our time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, is going to be spent doing on-call for the vast majority of us. And why is that? I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.300</a></span> | <span class="t">troubleshooting is going to get more and more complex as we go along. First is that as we write,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">as these software engineering, AI software engineering systems write more and more of our code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">humans are going to have less context about what happened. They don't understand the inner workings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">of the code. They don't have all the context in their minds, right? Second, we're going to push these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">systems to the limits. We're going to write more and more complex systems, just like the things we saw in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">the previous talks, right? So, the system's going to get more complex and we're going to have less</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding of it. And as a result, troubleshooting is going to get really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.980</a></span> | <span class="t">really painful and complex. And I think that's where we're going to spend most of our time in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">this world, which is just QA and on-call, right? And that'll be kind of a sad existence for ourselves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">if that's what happens, right? So, this, I think, is a grim reality if we don't do something about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So, now, if you think about the workflow of troubleshooting, what does it look like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In my head, you'll have all of these different wonderful companies like Grafana, Datadocs, Splunk, Elastic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Sentry, whatever it might be. And what they do, essentially, is they help process data and help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.740</a></span> | <span class="t">you visualize it, right? And so, if anyone who's been on a Datadoc dashboard or whatever it might be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">you have these beautiful dashboards, thousands of them, to give you some cut as to what is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.940</a></span> | <span class="t">health of your system. Now, something will break invariably in production. Then what happens next?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The next step, as I see it, is what I call dashboard dumpster diving, right? You'll go through all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">different thousands of dashboards to try to find the one that explains what happened. And you'll try to have many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">different people doing it in parallel. At some point, you might come up with some sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.260</a></span> | <span class="t">promising lead, like, okay, maybe that was it. That's the dashboard that kind of explains what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.300</a></span> | <span class="t">happened. Or that's the log that kind of explains what happened. Then you want to connect it to some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.460</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of change you made in your system, right? As we think about root cause analysis, it's typically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.220</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to connect it to some particular change in the system, whether it's a pull request or a change</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">of your configuration files, whatever it might be, right? And that's where you start, say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.460</a></span> | <span class="t">that's the second stage of your troubleshooting, which you stare aggressively at your code base until</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">something, you know, some sort of inspiration hits you. And then most of the time it doesn't hit you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.900</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you kind of bring more teams into the mix, because you know it's maybe not your issue,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and suddenly you have 30, 40, 50, 100 people in a Slack incident channel trying to figure out what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">happened. And this loop keeps going on and on and on, right? So the status quo of what incident</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.140</a></span> | <span class="t">production incident debugging looks like clearly is not optimal. And I think it's only going to get worse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.460</a></span> | <span class="t">space for all the reasons I talked about earlier. And obviously this problem has been around since</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.500</a></span> | <span class="t">software has been written, and it's not like we're the first people to think about thinking of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">issue, right? The problem is that the existing approaches we've taken to troubleshooting or using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">machine learning AI towards it have not worked, and I don't believe will work for really fundamental</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.820</a></span> | <span class="t">reasons, right? So the first one is what we call AI ops, broadly speaking, which is we're using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.220</a></span> | <span class="t">traditional machine learning and statistical anomaly detection type techniques to help figure out what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">happened, right? The problem is if any of you have actually tried these techniques in production</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">systems, it leads to too many false positives. Your system is too complex, too dynamic, and if you just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">try to come up with some sort of numerical representation of your data, it's going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.180</a></span> | <span class="t">not representative enough. And what you'll see is that you'll have thousands of alerts happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe one of them is useful, but you just don't know which one. So it typically leads to more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">signal, sorry, more noise than signal is what AI ops has led to, sadly. Okay, now we have this new world of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.020</a></span> | <span class="t">LLMs. Okay, so one option is, okay, let me -- I'm sure many people here have taken a log and put it in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">ChatGPT and said, "Explain to me what happened. What's going on in this log?" Right? That's something I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.460</a></span> | <span class="t">think all of us have done. Now, that's okay if you know which log you're going to look at, but if I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">actually dealing with production-grade systems, you're going to have petabytes of data. You might have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.780</a></span> | <span class="t">trillion logs. Which one do I look at? You can't take all of these different logs, the trillion logs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and put it in context. Right? Even if you have infinite context, it doesn't matter. The size of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.380</a></span> | <span class="t">these systems are so large that, forget about the context window, it doesn't even fit into memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't even fit into a cluster. That's why you have such difficult retention policies for data,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.300</a></span> | <span class="t">right, for logs and metrics. And second, the problem with these LLMs are is that they don't have a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">good understanding of the numerical representation of the data. So they have a good semantic understanding,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.540</a></span> | <span class="t">they don't have a good numerical representation, and also the context isn't big enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, now the third thing we might think about is let's build an agent, right? Like, let's build a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.780</a></span> | <span class="t">React-style agent. The problem with that is that if you think about these React-style agents, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">they're going to do is they're going to assume you have some access to some sort of runbook, some sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.260</a></span> | <span class="t">of meta workflow that they can rely on to help you make a decision of what next tool to call. The problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.460</a></span> | <span class="t">is any runbook you actually put into place is deprecated the second you created. I don't know how many of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.540</a></span> | <span class="t">you have used runbooks, but typically what we've found in my experience and the team's experience is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.580</a></span> | <span class="t">they're typically deprecated by the time they're built, right? And so that workflow that the agent is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.220</a></span> | <span class="t">to go through is not going to be optimal. And also if you try to make it do a much more broad search of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">system, if you give it these simple tools, it's going to take too long, right? If you just put it into like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">loop, tool calling loop, it might take days to run if it doesn't time out, right? And typically if you try to solve an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">incident, you need to solve it in two to five minutes for it to be really useful, right? So every minute counts when things are down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So as a result, none of these three things, if you do them just by themselves, is enough to really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">troubleshoot. There's fundamental issues in all of them that I think need to be solved by thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">about them in a more collective way. And that's really what we're trying to do at Traversal, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, what you need to do with Traversal is, what we're trying to do at Traversal is really good out of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.540</a></span> | <span class="t">sample autonomous troubleshooting, which is that if you have a new incident, we've never seen it before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">can you troubleshoot it from first principles debugging? And to do so, I think we need to combine a few different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">ideas. The first one being statistical, the second one being semantics, and then the third one being a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">novel agentic control flow. And with statistics, what I mean is causal machine learning. So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">where a lot of our research came. So the idea of causal machine learning is this idea of being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">correlation is in causation. So how do you get these AI systems to pick up cause and effect relationships</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.820</a></span> | <span class="t">from data programmatically? That's what we spend a lot of time thinking about. And obviously that problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">shows up a lot in production incidents, because typically when something breaks, a lot of things break</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.260</a></span> | <span class="t">around them, right? So there's a lot of correlated failures, which are not the root cause. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.780</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking about it programmatically is what the study of causal machine learning is. The second being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.700</a></span> | <span class="t">semantics, right? Which is actually trying to push the limits of what these reasoning models can give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.780</a></span> | <span class="t">you to help you understand the semantic, rich semantic context that exists in log fields, in the metadata</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.700</a></span> | <span class="t">source of the metric, and so on and so forth, right? Or in code itself, right? And so by combining</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.060</a></span> | <span class="t">causal machine learning, which is the best of what statistics gives you, and reasoning models, which is the best of what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.460</a></span> | <span class="t">semantics gives you, you now have at least the tools, the basic tools to put into place so that you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.100</a></span> | <span class="t">actually deal with this issue. Now we have to figure out how do you actually make this work in an agentic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">system. And what we found is this idea of swarms of agent, where you have these thousands of parallel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">agentic tool calls happening, giving you this kind of exhaustive search to all of your telemetry in some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of efficient way. That's what brings it together and helps you actually deal with this issue, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So just to repeat, it's statistics, which is causal machine learning, semantics, which is these reasoning models,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.700</a></span> | <span class="t">and this novel agentic control flow, which you call the swarms of agent, all of this put together in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">the right elegant way is what actually helps you autonomously troubleshoot, right? A lot of the work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.140</a></span> | <span class="t">we rely on is based on our years of research, years of experience as researchers, we've written a number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.340</a></span> | <span class="t">of papers on these various different fields, and also relying on a lot of the research that has happened</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.500</a></span> | <span class="t">in general in the field over the last couple of years that we're relying on to actually make this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">into a reality. And so if you think about the troubleshooting workflow we talked about earlier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and all the pains of it, each of the different things can help remove or alleviate some of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.500</a></span> | <span class="t">pains. So the idea of finding the promising lead from your sea of information, that's where this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">agent swarm and causal machine learning put together really help. And then from the promising lead,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">connecting it to a specific change in your system, whether it's a pull request or change log,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that's where a lot of the work that's happening in code agents and also vector search we're relying on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">it.

What I wanted to spend my time doing there was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">focusing and writing beautiful code.

But you're not looking through some documents, you're not looking through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.900</a></span> | <span class="t">a database table, you're looking through hundreds of millions of metrics, which are viewable on thousands</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">of dashboards. And beyond this, you also have tens of billions of logs that you might want to find.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And these are coming from thousands of services. And what's the thing you're looking for here? You're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.740</a></span> | <span class="t">looking for a something that's comparatively microscopic. So this might be a single log that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">describes the thing that went wrong, the root cause of the incident. And you know, if you're lucky, after a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">few hours of everybody frantically searching, the incident gets resolved, and you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">everybody can go back to work. That is until the next production incident comes, and the cycle repeats</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">itself. So this is a very familiar situation to me. Unfortunately, it may be a very similar situation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">to all of you. But things have changed for digital ocean. So what traversal's been able to do for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">digital ocean is make their mission critical infrastructure far more resilient. So you'll see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">here that mean time to resolution, MTTR, has reduced pretty dramatically for digital ocean. We've measured</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.100</a></span> | <span class="t">that about 40% reduction, and the amount of time that it takes to find and resolve production incidents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of these minutes mean a lot of pain for an engineer that's now been removed, and also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.260</a></span> | <span class="t">thousands of dollars for each minute. So now I'll be able to show you how this works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the world post-traversal, rather than this frantic search going on all the time, when an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.220</a></span> | <span class="t">incident kicks off, the traversal AI, the ambient traversal AI, begins its investigation. And the thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.260</a></span> | <span class="t">that it begins its investigation with is the same little bit of context that engineers get when the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.340</a></span> | <span class="t">incident starts. And given the small amount of context, traversal AI orchestrates a swarm of expert</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.500</a></span> | <span class="t">AI SREs to sift through petabytes of observability data all in parallel. And so what was done previously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">manually is done exhaustively and automatically. And then after about five minutes, traversal comes back to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.740</a></span> | <span class="t">users right where they are in the incident Slack channel and tells them what happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So here you can see that traversal identified an issue. There was a deployment that introduced changes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.700</a></span> | <span class="t">a cascade of issues throughout the entire system. And when engineers see this, they can roll it back,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">they can move on and get back to their good work. And you'll note here that traversal - the engineers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">of DigitalOcean noted that this was the thing that solved the issue. This was the correct finding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is happening all the time. Engineers that want to dive in further can look in the traversal UI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">where you have a well of information that traversal unearths describing what happened with the incident.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It cites relevant observability data, just like any good engineer would. It gives you confidence levels</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">for the potential root cause candidates. It explains its reasoning. And if you want to dive in even further,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.980</a></span> | <span class="t">traversal allows you to interact with an AI-generated impact map. And you can even ask follow-up questions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.820</a></span> | <span class="t">to traversal to ask questions like, "How does this incident impact the part of the stack that I care the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.500</a></span> | <span class="t">most about?" And this entire experience is exactly the kind of thing that I was dying for in my previous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">roles. And I'm so excited to share that it's now a reality. So - thank you. But this is not just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">happening for DigitalOcean. We're working across a very heterogeneous group of enterprise environments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So you'll see here - the thing that I want you to focus on here is that we're talking to basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.780</a></span> | <span class="t">every observability tool out there, and we're talking to them on a massive scale. We're talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.140</a></span> | <span class="t">trillions of logs. So yes, it's an AI agent's problem, and I like thinking about the AI agent's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.340</a></span> | <span class="t">problem. But in reality, this is just as much an AI infrastructure problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Furthermore, the problem that we're solving here is one where we have a massive set of data,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and we're looking for this small piece of information that's telling you everything that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.140</a></span> | <span class="t">you need to know. This is sort of a needle in the haystack problem. And we're focused right now on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.700</a></span> | <span class="t">observability. But there are plenty of other domains where there are similar principles that can be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">applied. In my experience that when you're doing network observability, you're working on cyber</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.060</a></span> | <span class="t">security, you find similar patterns here that I hope that you all in your respective domains can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">take from this that these strategies of exhaustive search and swarms of agents can be applied in these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6_NiGIEXZQ&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.820</a></span> | <span class="t">domains as well.
