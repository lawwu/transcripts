I preached a few months ago from 2 Timothy 4, where Paul said, "At my first defense,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgBb_BI4g4Y&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">no one stood by me. Everybody deserted me, but the Lord stood by me and strengthened me." Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgBb_BI4g4Y&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you could take that verse and say, "See? He didn't need people. Jesus was his friend. Jesus will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgBb_BI4g4Y&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">never fail. People will always fail you. I'm tired of dealing with people. They're just fickle, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgBb_BI4g4Y&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">they let you down. And I'm going to be like Paul and have the Lord stand by me. And if everybody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgBb_BI4g4Y&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">forsakes me, that's their problem. I've got Jesus." That is totally not what Paul experienced in that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgBb_BI4g4Y&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">chapter, because he said just a little bit later to Timothy, "Do your best to come to me before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgBb_BI4g4Y&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">winter." And he said a little earlier, "Luke alone is with me. Get Mark. Bring him with you. He is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgBb_BI4g4Y&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">useful to me in the ministry." This is Paul's heart in all of his letters. Paul hated being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgBb_BI4g4Y&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">in ministry alone. When he was forced to go alone to Athens, first thing he did was send back,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgBb_BI4g4Y&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">"Please get Timothy and the team down here as soon as you can. I don't want to be here in this city</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgBb_BI4g4Y&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">by myself." And so I think it stands that Christ died so that we would not be Christian loners,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgBb_BI4g4Y&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but would be in Christ-exalting friendships, because if you say, "Why?" It's because there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgBb_BI4g4Y&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">more of Christ to be known in Christ-exalting friendships. You know, I don't want to twist</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgBb_BI4g4Y&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the arm of a loner and say, "You ought to do this, and it's your duty to do this." I want to say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgBb_BI4g4Y&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">"You're missing something, really missing something.

The head can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgBb_BI4g4Y&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">say to the feet, "I have no need of you."'" They can't.

So here's my encouragement. First of all, to the loners who think they don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgBb_BI4g4Y&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">need others, I would say you're kicking against the pricks.
