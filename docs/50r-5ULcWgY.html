But of course, what we've learned in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=79">00:01:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">last few decades is really two things. First, we've understood that the universe had an origin</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=85">00:01:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">about 13.8 billion years ago in a so-called Big Bang, a hot, dense state, whose very beginnings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=93">00:01:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">are still shrouded in mystery. And also, we've learned more about the extreme things in it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=98">00:01:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">black holes, neutron stars, explosions of various kinds. And one of the most potentially exciting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=105">00:01:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">discoveries in the last 20 years, mainly the last 10, has been the realization that most of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=112">00:01:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">stars in the sky are orbited by retinues of planets, just as the Sun is orbited by the Earth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=119">00:01:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and the other familiar planets.

I mean, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=165">00:02:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">entirely logically possible that life is unique to this Earth.

I think many of us would indeed bet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=2106">00:35:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that probably some kind of life exists elsewhere. But even if you accept that, then there are many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=2114">00:35:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">contingencies going from simple life to present-day life. And some biologists like Stephen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=2121">00:35:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Jay Gould thought that if you reran evolution, you'd end up with something quite different,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=2126">00:35:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and maybe not with an intelligent species. So, the contingencies in evolution may</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=2131">00:35:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">militate against the emergence of intelligence, even if life gets started in lots of places. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=2138">00:35:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I think these are still completely open questions.

I mean, I mentioned the fact that the origin of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=2147">00:35:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">life is a question that we may be able to understand, and serious people are working on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=2154">00:35:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's usually put in the sort of too difficult box.

But it's not like that now. And that's partly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=2163">00:36:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">because of clever experiments, but I think most importantly, because we are aware that we can look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=2170">00:36:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for life in other places, other places in our solar system, and of course, on the exoplanets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=2176">00:36:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">around other stars.

Because now, of course, these exoplanets are detected by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=2207">00:36:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">their effects on the parent star.

So, most of the 5,000-plus planets that have been found around other stars, they've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=2225">00:37:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">been found indirectly by their effect in one of those two ways on the parent star.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=2229">00:37:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">>> You could still do a pretty good job of estimating size, all those kinds of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=2233">00:37:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Size and the mass, you can estimate.

So there's a trade-off. And there are examples. I mean, for instance, the other thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=6635">01:50:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we learned was that it may be efficient to have 95% of your hospital intensive care beds occupied</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=6643">01:50:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">all the time, which has been the UK situation, whereas to do what the Germans do and always keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r-5ULcWgY&t=6648">01:50:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">20% of them free for an emergency is really a sensible precaution.
