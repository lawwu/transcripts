But when you're, we talk about online deals, you're not necessarily buying a physical gift card. So in the case of these apps, what you're really just getting are numbers and pins. So if it's something that you can do just by copying and pasting numbers, then like, that's really appealing to people.</p><p>So pepper, as you mentioned, like that's been huge. I sort of hesitate to talk too much about it just because like, you have to spend a lot of money in a short amount of time to get the really good deals from pepper. And also who knows for how long pepper will continue to be like a really great place to get gift cards.</p><p>But yeah, it seems like every year or two, an app comes around where they're, they're losing money selling gift cards because they want to increase revenue. They want to increase users, things like that. And if somebody is willing to subsidize the product, you should always buy as much of that product as you can.</p><p>And if it's a gift card, all the better. Cause it's, it's like they're selling dollars for 50 cents.</p></div></div></body></html>
