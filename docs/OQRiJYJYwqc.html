So let's just start at the basics. Can you kind of cover what are the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">principles like first principles of just building a more energy efficient home and why that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">important? The first place you start is creating an airtight house. You want a house to be as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">airtight and well insulated as you can. If you don't, if you don't have a well airtight house,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it doesn't matter what kind of tech you put into it, what kind of solar panels you put on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">If it can't hold onto its heat energy or keep heat out efficiently, your energy use is going to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">through the roof. So you have to make sure that you're building it right to make sure that it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">meets certain standards. And one of those is a passive house. There's a passive house standard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that is very popular around the world. It's gaining ground. I did not build my house to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">passive house certification, but I took a lot of the underlying principles into mind when putting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this house together.

And is that something that applies only to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">new homes or if I'm sitting, which, which right now is about a hundred year old home, is this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">still something I can aspire to achieve?

You can do this to, you can retrofit old houses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and in a lot of areas there's like, you can basically bring in an energy kind of guide.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Usually like in my area, I'm in Massachusetts, there's a program called mass save and it's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">free service through the state.

There's a lot of low hanging fruit that you can really do on a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">house that's a hundred years old to make it way, way better. Yeah. And I actually got a listener</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">from, or an email from a listener in Arkansas who had a similar program where the state kind of had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">someone come out, but they also paid for it.

If you live in an area, like I know in California,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you have time of use rates.

So for instance, in California,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">time use rates, super cheap overnight.

And what you're saying, you know, in California, PG&E gives you multiple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">rate options, right?

They actually run a, they won't do this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">proactively, but on the website, you can say, run what my bill would have been for the last year on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">all the plans and tell me which plan would have been the cheapest.

What's the cost difference between the different rates that you're seeing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want to say the cost difference is about 2X on our rate plan.

But as an example, there is an EVB plan, which is different. And it's 29 cents from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">midnight to 7am, 40 cents per kilowatt hour from 7am to 2pm, and then 64 cents from 2 to 9pm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So 29 to 64 is the range.

So it's like a really tiny gap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And another great thing, one benefit of an electric car is that the cost of electricity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is often cheaper than the cost of gas. Another is that in California, at least,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you can get on an electric vehicle rate plan for your home. And that peak pricing is a shorter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">window and a lower price.

And so when it used to be a bedroom, if you wanted someone to sleep here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's on the ground floor, you'd have to crank the heat up in the rest of the house.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so one option is if your ducts are really accessible, you can add a fan in your ducts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">which will turn on when it senses certain temperature air and blow air to try to help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">redistribute the air. Or you can get a register fan, which is what we have. So the vent actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">has a fan built in. And when it senses cool or hot air based on a desired temperature, it will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">suck that air in faster to try to help distribute things around the house.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was one big one that we had. And then the other is just we got a lot of quotes. When</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we added air conditioning, the quotes were like two to three x difference for people doing the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">same thing. And so I don't know, those are a few of mine. What about what do you think about when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you think about an efficient HVAC system? Oh, man, it's the ductwork is a big one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">My old house, the ductwork head was not sealed well. So all the joints were leaking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">air. And like, so one side of the house was always hot and the other side of the house</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">was always cold. And we were always trying those hacks of you kind of like semi closed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the registers on one side to try to force more pressure to get to the other side of the house.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But when you do that, you can throw the HVAC system kind of out of balance, which is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">good for the system as all. So the idea of the fan is a great one. It's a nice hack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=810" target="_blank">00:13:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to get into the pricey options really quick when I say this, but it's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">heat pump all the things. Yeah. Let's talk about that, because that was a question that we had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">when we were talking to all these HVAC people about, do we want to do a heat pump?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And unsophisticatedly came to the conclusion, no. Now feeling like I regret it, but talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">heat pumps. Heat pumps are the most energy efficient way to generate heat or air conditioning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">hands down. Nothing comes close. It feels like it breaks the laws of physics,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">because like if you're talking about electric resistive heat, it's like for every unit of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">energy you put in, you get one unit of heat energy out. But with a heat pump,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not generating the heat in that kind of conversion. It's just moving it. So it's taking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">heat from the air that's outside your house and it's moving it inside the house and using a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">compressor to amplify it. So for every unit of energy you put into the system, you're getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">three or four units of energy of heat back out. And that's the same for air conditioning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're doing a reverse of that. So heat pumps are just the most efficient thing you can do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The downside is they tend to be more expensive upfront. So when you're trying to price it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it may look like a little bit of sticker shock of like, oh my God, what am I doing? This is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">30% more expensive than this other system. That's less efficient. Why would I do that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You're talking about timeframes. So it's like, what's that payback period? So heat pumps might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">take three, five, six years to earn their keep. But then after that point, you're just saving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">gobs and gobs of energy and money after that point. And would that replace a furnace and an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">air conditioner unit? Or what does the heat pump replace? It replaces everything. It's like a heat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">pump. Heat pump goes both ways. In my new house, I have a geothermal heat pump, which is instead of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">extracting heat from the air, it's extracting heat from deep in the earth. There's a 400 foot well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that was drilled in my yard. And they basically just ran a pipe, a tube down that 400 feet back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">up again. And it's got a liquid that goes through it. And it's just, it's like a giant water cooled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">PC if you know about PCs, but it's like, you're basically just taking, if you want to air</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">condition, you're taking the heat from the inside of the house, you're dumping it into the earth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and the earth is cooling down that liquid. So when it comes back up into the house,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that's being used to cool your house. And then the reverse in winter, if it's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">if I'm trying to get hot air in the house, it's extracting the heat from the earth and bringing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it in and amplifying it. So it's one system that does both. Okay. And what would, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like an upgrade cost be if someone just has a standard house, is this like tens of thousands,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">thousands? That's a loaded question. Cause it depends. Cause there's so many different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">kinds of heat pumps. You can get air source, heat pumps, which are the cheapest. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">if you want to go super, I don't want to call it cheap, cheap, but like, they're still really good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">is, uh, like a ductless mini split system. That's probably the most affordable way to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">heat pump system into your house with as a retrofit.

So let's say a typical heating system might cost you $10,000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">for an upgrade.

Uh, if you want to flip</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=1005" target="_blank">00:16:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">into what I did, geothermal, uh, your eyes will pop out of your head. The sticker shock, uh, kicks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in very fast. Um, cause they can get very expensive because it comes down to the drilling of the well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that whole system, that whole side of it is expensive. The mechanicals in my house are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">not the expensive part. The really expensive part is drilling wells and doing all the stuff you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to do outside to get it to work. But at the end of the day, if you live in a place, you live in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Massachusetts, it gets hot in the summer and cold in the winter. You're using your heating and air</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=1036" target="_blank">00:17:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">conditioning quite a bit.

We're using our air conditioning so little that living in the Bay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">area, we didn't have it for the first 12 years. So like, you know, it's temperate enough that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">don't need it that often. The heat also doesn't run that often. So I think if I remember right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the reason why we ended up not doing a heat pump was that the less you use your heating and air</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">conditioning, the less, you know, the longer that our return investment will take.

So it didn't make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=1067" target="_blank">00:17:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that much sense.

That's, it's something I always tell people when they ask me, should I get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">solar panels? It's like, I can't answer that for you. You have to figure it out yourself because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it's such a personal thing. Like it makes so much sense for me for solar and a geothermal in my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">current place right now. But like where you live, a heat pump, the expense of that would make no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=1085" target="_blank">00:18:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">sense.

And we even bought this thing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2160" target="_blank">00:36:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you like plug into the, us an outlet and you just run this thing along the sort of wall and it'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2166" target="_blank">00:36:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">beep when it's there, but it's, it's not very accurate. Uh, and so we have some ways to go,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2171" target="_blank">00:36:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">but that dovetails nicely. So one way to save money on energy is to reduce your usage. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2179" target="_blank">00:36:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we talked briefly. Another one is to dial in your rate plan to match your usage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2184" target="_blank">00:36:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">but a whole nother one is to just produce your own energy. So let's, I moved into a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2189" target="_blank">00:36:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">home with solar, so I didn't have to make a decision, but you've had to make that decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2193" target="_blank">00:36:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So how do you think about when it makes sense to kind of produce your own energy? Uh, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2199" target="_blank">00:36:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe, maybe there's another option. I remember there was this one house in San Francisco that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2202" target="_blank">00:36:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">had a wind turbine on the roof. Uh, but, but how do you think about solar as an option and when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2208" target="_blank">00:36:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it makes sense? Yeah, I've done this twice. Now I did it on my old house and I've done it on this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2213" target="_blank">00:36:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">house.

It's still not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2217" target="_blank">00:36:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">turned on yet, but the way I look at it is you have to have a clear set of goals that you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2221" target="_blank">00:37:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to do. Like, what are your goals? Are you just looking to save money on your energy bill and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2225" target="_blank">00:37:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">come out ahead? Are you concerned about climate change? Whatever. Are you looking for energy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2230" target="_blank">00:37:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">security? Because power goes out in your neighborhood several times a year because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2235" target="_blank">00:37:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">there's big storms that come through and knock down power lines. What is it that you're trying to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2240" target="_blank">00:37:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">um, solve for? And once you have that criteria, it becomes very easy to decide if solar is right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2247" target="_blank">00:37:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">for you or not. And it's kind of what I said earlier of like, I can't say everybody should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2250" target="_blank">00:37:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">go solar because it may not fit your goals. So for like me and my personal situation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2255" target="_blank">00:37:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it was, I was looking for energy security and to save some money over the long term.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2260" target="_blank">00:37:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like, I wasn't looking for a short term goal for saving money. But in my areas where I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2265" target="_blank">00:37:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">live here in Massachusetts, we get, you know, ice storms that come through bad storms in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2269" target="_blank">00:37:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">winter that sometimes knock out my power lines.

It's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2586" target="_blank">00:43:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you guys had the best programs for years.

So there's some decent incentives that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2595" target="_blank">00:43:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">can get that knock off the cost of what the system will be out of pocket. And then there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2599" target="_blank">00:43:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the federal tax rebate that you can get, which knocks 30% off your, uh, how much you owe on your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2604" target="_blank">00:43:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">taxes that you can claim. So when you're talking about, like, if you're installing a system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2608" target="_blank">00:43:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that's $30,000, you're knocking $10,000 right off the bat because the federal tax credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2613" target="_blank">00:43:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then my state knocks, you know, another 7,000 off of that.

And it's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2843" target="_blank">00:47:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">they show me like they live in a large house and they share the plan with me.

Oh, there's a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2889" target="_blank">00:48:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a few really cool things.

It changes the material. Think about like water goes through a phase change when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2902" target="_blank">00:48:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it goes, turns into steam. So you have a phase change material, like it's like a wax. So it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2906" target="_blank">00:48:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of like a solid, and then it becomes kind of like this soft liquid material. So there's these,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2912" target="_blank">00:48:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it almost looks like the size of a, um, instant water heater.

There's a company that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=2947" target="_blank">00:49:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to bring this flow battery to market.

Uh, but I also wanted to make sure I was only getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3212" target="_blank">00:53:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">things that had a purpose. Like, I'm not a big fan of like, Oh, I have a smart light. They can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3216" target="_blank">00:53:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">turn red and green just because it can. It's like that kind of stuff is like, not what I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3221" target="_blank">00:53:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">concerned with. It was more about smart light switches that can turn rooms off if nobody's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3226" target="_blank">00:53:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">there for a certain period of time, stuff like that. Okay. And what is that light switch? Cause</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3230" target="_blank">00:53:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I have, I, we, the things we did here, maybe I'll share what we did when we moved into this house,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3235" target="_blank">00:53:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we replaced all the light switches with Lutron cassette lights, which at the time seemed like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3240" target="_blank">00:54:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the best lighting automation system certainly doesn't sense what's happening anywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3244" target="_blank">00:54:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was one big change we made. And fortunately, the previous homeowner had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3249" target="_blank">00:54:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">done a lot of hardwiring. So we ran, we have, uh, a ubiquity Unifi Wi-Fi system and, and including</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3258" target="_blank">00:54:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Unifi cameras that are mostly run hardwired. Those are the 2 big pieces, but I'm curious,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3265" target="_blank">00:54:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">um, you know, from your side, what were the components that you thought were actually useful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3269" target="_blank">00:54:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and important in your system? Well, the first one was lighting and we went with Lutron for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3274" target="_blank">00:54:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the new house. Lutron is the only smart home device I've ever used that has been rock solid,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3281" target="_blank">00:54:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">never had a problem, never failed me in any way, shape, or form. It works with every system that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3286" target="_blank">00:54:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">out there. It is like the cream of the crop as far as I'm concerned. So when I moved in here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3291" target="_blank">00:54:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I got all the Lutron cassette for all the switches and then since because it ties into any system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3296" target="_blank">00:54:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">then I can basically automate things. I'm using Apple home as my base, but I may actually be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3302" target="_blank">00:55:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">shifting that. But it's like, I can set up automations for all this kind of stuff of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3306" target="_blank">00:55:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">if nobody's home, lights go off. If it's this time of night, certain lights go off. If it's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3311" target="_blank">00:55:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, room is empty for a certain period of time, lights can go off. So it allows me to set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3315" target="_blank">00:55:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">up those automations in a rock solid way that just always works. And that was the first place I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3319" target="_blank">00:55:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">started. Great. I feel great about my decision to do that because we have the same system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3324" target="_blank">00:55:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What about other, I've got ubiquity unify stuff everywhere too. Cause it's like, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3329" target="_blank">00:55:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it's kind of like the cream of the crop when you're talking about security cameras, wifi,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3334" target="_blank">00:55:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">setting up home networks, it really is the best. It's, it's, it's the first time I've used it and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3339" target="_blank">00:55:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I love it. Yeah. I can't think of the number of times in our last home, I had to restart a router.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3344" target="_blank">00:55:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the advantage of unify system is I have not restarted our router in over a year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3351" target="_blank">00:55:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep. It might restart at night when no, one's actively using it to upgrade the software. Maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3356" target="_blank">00:55:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that's happening, but it is so solid that I just haven't had to do any restarting or anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3361" target="_blank">00:56:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not the most consumer friendly to set up. And I think they're getting better there, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3366" target="_blank">00:56:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, that's been solid. And then, you know, almost every home internet plan is now unlimited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3373" target="_blank">00:56:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So it doesn't really matter, but it is nice that, you know, all the cameras are local.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3378" target="_blank">00:56:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, we've just got a massive hard drive in the, in our kind of what's called a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3383" target="_blank">00:56:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">dream machine pro similar, probably to what you have, and you could still stream your cameras</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3387" target="_blank">00:56:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">from anywhere, but you're not constantly using your bandwidth to stream, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3392" target="_blank">00:56:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">nine cameras to the cloud, uh, and, and storing them on someone else's server,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3397" target="_blank">00:56:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">which just eats into your, you know, bandwidth use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3400" target="_blank">00:56:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And on top of which is recording all the time.

Um, and if you have rogue devices that are using a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3429" target="_blank">00:57:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of bandwidth, that's another thing I noticed is that the dream machine shows you per client.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3435" target="_blank">00:57:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So it shows how much bandwidth each thing is using.

I have a room that needs this like a dark room that every time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3877" target="_blank">01:04:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and the light switch is so poorly located that you have to like reach around stuff.

But then I'm like, gosh, couldn't we just use the ring sensors that we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3887" target="_blank">01:04:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">on all these doors already? But I think ring is is kind of private in that way. Did you do anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3893" target="_blank">01:04:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">for security in your house?

So it's like any sensors I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3905" target="_blank">01:05:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">would add could then show up in Apple Home and I could use them for different automations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3910" target="_blank">01:05:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's part of the reason I'm looking at that system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3912" target="_blank">01:05:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Any other smart home things I'm forgetting that you've thought about in this new house?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQRiJYJYwqc&t=3917" target="_blank">01:05:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm doing Lutron Serena shades throughout my house.
