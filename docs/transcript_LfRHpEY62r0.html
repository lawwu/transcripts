There's a lot that can be done to improve quality of life of individuals, and those will be steps along the way. And then ultimately, it's intended to address the existential risk associated with digital superintelligence. Like, we will not be able to be smarter than a digital supercomputer. So therefore, if you cannot beat them, join them. And at least we won't have that option. So you have hope that Neuralink will be able to be a kind of connection to allow us to merge, to ride the wave of the improving AI systems? I think the chance is above 0%. So it's non-zero. There's a chance. Have you seen Dumb and Dumber? Yes. So I'm saying there's a chance. He's saying one in a billion or one in a million, whatever it was at Dumb and Dumber. You know, it went from maybe one in a million to improving, maybe it'll be one in a thousand and then one in a hundred, then one in ten. It depends on the rate of improvement of Neuralink and how fast we're able to make progress. Well, I've talked to a few folks here that are quite brilliant engineers, so I'm excited. It's important that Neuralink solve this problem sooner rather than later, because the point at which we have digital superintelligence, that's when we pass to singularity and things become just very uncertain. It doesn't mean that they're necessarily bad or good, but the point at which we pass to singularity, things become extremely unstable. So we want to have a human brain interface before the singularity, or at least not long after it, to minimize existential risk for humanity and consciousness as we know it.
