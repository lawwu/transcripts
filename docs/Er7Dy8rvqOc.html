And the answer is, I think you need to do all different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=894">00:14:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">kinds of reasoning inside a computer, depending on what kinds of problems you face.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=899">00:14:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">- I guess the question is, what kind of things can you encode symbolically so you can reason about?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=907">00:15:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">- I think the idea about, and even symbolic, I don't even like that terminology,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=916">00:15:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">'cause I don't know what it means technically and formally.

You cannot reason at completely fine grain about everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=927">00:15:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in your life, right?

And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=950">00:15:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the answer is abstraction, spatial abstraction, temporal abstraction. I think abstraction along</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=955">00:15:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the lines of goals is also interesting.

So I think that's where these kinds of, if you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=966">00:16:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to call it symbolic or discrete models come in. You talk about a room of your house instead of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=973">00:16:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">your pose.

And also because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=988">00:16:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't have enough information to reason in high fidelity about your pose of your elbow at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=995">00:16:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">2.35 this afternoon anyway. - Right.

When you try to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1033">00:17:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">actually solve the problem with computers, the right answer comes out. You mentioned abstractions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1039">00:17:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, neural networks form abstractions or rather there's automated ways to form abstractions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1047">00:17:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">- Absolutely. - And there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1047">00:17:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">expert driven ways to form abstractions and expert human driven ways.

So when you're referring to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1059">00:17:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">2.45 p.m. versus afternoon, how do we construct that taxonomy?

I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1073">00:17:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I think when we get to be better machine learning engineers, we'll build algorithms that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1080">00:18:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">build awesome abstractions. - That are useful in this kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1083">00:18:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of way that you're describing. - Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1084">00:18:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">- Yeah.

So first,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1100">00:18:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">what are Markov decision processes? - What are Markov decision processes?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1103">00:18:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">- And maybe how much of our world can be models and MDPs? How much, when you wake up in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1110">00:18:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">morning and you're making breakfast, do you think of yourself as an MDP? So how do you think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1115">00:18:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">MDPs and how they relate to our world? - Well, so there's a stance question, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1121">00:18:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So a stance is a position that I take with respect to a problem. So I, as a researcher or a person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1128">00:18:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">who designs systems, can decide to make a model of the world around me in some terms. So I take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1136">00:18:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this messy world and I say, I'm going to treat it as if it were a problem of this formal kind,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1142">00:19:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and then I can apply solution concepts or algorithms or whatever to solve that formal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1146">00:19:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">thing, right? So of course the world is not anything. It's not an MDP or a POMDP. I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1151">00:19:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">know what it is, but I can model aspects of it in some way or some other way. And when I model some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1156">00:19:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">aspect of it in a certain way, that gives me some set of algorithms I can use. - You can model the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1161">00:19:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">world in all kinds of ways.

Some really force the world to be deterministic.

So what are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1192">00:19:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Markov decision processes? - Okay, so Markov decision process is a model. It's a kind of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1196">00:19:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">model that you could make that says, I know completely the current state of my system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1200">00:20:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And what it means to be a state is that I have all the information right now that will let me make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1208">00:20:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">predictions about the future as well as I can.

I think it's a, I mean, it's certainly not a good model for most problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1241">00:20:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I think because for most problems, you don't actually know the state.

So that's now a different problem class. - So, okay, that's where the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1253">00:20:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">POMDPs, the partially observable Markov decision processes step in.

So now the idea is we still kind of postulate that there exists a state. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1270">00:21:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">think that there is some information about the world out there such that if we knew that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1275">00:21:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">could make good predictions, but we don't know the state. And so then we have to think about how,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1281">00:21:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but we do get observations.

So there's no point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1894">00:31:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in planning in detail. But you have to have -- you have to make a leap of faith that you can figure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1901">00:31:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it out once you get there.

And that's critical. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1918">00:31:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you would never plan to fly somewhere if you couldn't -- didn't have a model of how hard it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1923">00:32:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">was to do some of the intermediate steps. So one of the things we're thinking about now is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1926">00:32:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">how do you do this kind of very aggressive generalization to situations that you haven't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1934">00:32:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">been in and so on, to predict how long will it take to walk through the Kuala Lumpur airport?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1938">00:32:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you could give me an estimate and it wouldn't be crazy.

So I'm really interested in these kinds of abstract models and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1954">00:32:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">how do we acquire them.

Yeah, there's this notion of goal regression and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1964">00:32:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">pre-image backchaining, this idea of starting at the goal and just forming these big clouds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1970">00:32:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of states. I mean, it's almost like saying to the airport, you know, you know, once you show up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1979">00:32:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to the airport, that you're like a few steps away from the goal. So like, thinking of it this way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=1987">00:33:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it's kind of interesting.

Right? So what are we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=2437">00:40:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">going to do with the output of it?

And the idea that we're going to go from being people who engineer algorithms</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3475">00:57:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to being people who engineer objective functions, I think that's definitely going to happen. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3480">00:58:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that's going to change our thinking and methodology. >> You started at Stanford</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3485">00:58:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">philosophy, that's where you should go back to philosophy. >> Philosophy, maybe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3489">00:58:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Designing objective functions. >> Well, I mean, they're mixed together,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3492">00:58:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">because as we also know, as machine learning people, right, when you design, in fact, this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3498">00:58:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the lecture I gave in class today, when you design an objective function, you have to wear both hats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3503">00:58:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">There's the hat that says, what do I want?

And I have to take that into account. So it's always a tradeoff,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3514">00:58:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and we have to kind of be mindful of that. The part about taking people's jobs, I understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3521">00:58:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that that's important.

Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3536">00:58:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">>> I mean, I think other people should be thinking about it, but I'm just, that's not my strength.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3539">00:58:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">>> So what do you think is the most exciting area of research in the short term,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3544">00:59:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">for the community and for yourself? >> Well, so, I mean, there's this story</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3548">00:59:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been telling about how to engineer intelligent robots, right? So that's what we want to do. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3555">00:59:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">all kind of want to do, well, I mean, some set of us want to do this. And the question is, what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3560">00:59:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the most effective strategy? And we've tried, and there's a bunch of different things you could do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3564">00:59:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">at the extremes, right? One super extreme is we do introspection and we write a program. Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3570">00:59:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that has not worked out very well. Another extreme is we take a giant bunch of neural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3575">00:59:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">goo and we try to train it up to do something. I don't think that's going to work either.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3579">00:59:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question is, what's the middle ground? And again, this isn't a theological question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3588">00:59:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">or anything like that. It's just like, how do we, what's the best way to make this work out?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3594">00:59:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it's clear, it's a combination of learning. To me, it's clear. It's a combination</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3600">01:00:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of learning and not learning. And what should that combination be? And what's the stuff we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3605">01:00:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">build in? So to me, that's the most compelling question. >> And when you say engineer robots,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er7Dy8rvqOc&t=3609">01:00:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you mean engineering systems that work in the real world?
