We get questions all the time from podcast listeners and YouTube viewers and people who read our blogs and our email is askcompoundshow@gmail.com. Today's Portfolio Rescue is sponsored by Liftoff, which is our automated investing platform through Betterment. Duncan, are we going to do a video? Yeah, do you want to do the full one or the shorter one? You pick. Okay, we'll do the full one. Five, four, three, two, one, zero. Liftoff. Liftoff 30 minutes after the end. It's just beautiful. You know, I've been getting, I have a Liftoff account. I opened one for my wife and I opened one for each of my kids and I've been getting a lot of emails this year from Liftoff about tax loss harvesting opportunities. See, so there's a positive spin there. If you want to learn more about Liftoff, we actually have an advisor who works there. We have a few advisors who can help. So, if you want an automated investing platform with an advisor who you can ask questions to, go to liftoffsinvest.com. Alright, John, throw up my first chart of the day here. This is just the S&P. This is a little stale now that the stocks have gone down more. I posted this about a week ago. This is just this year for the S&P 500. You can see we've had a ton of down, up, down, up, down, up, and all these different changes and a lot of volatility. I posted this and Andrew on Twitter responded with this following question. John, throw it up there. "Ben, any precedent for this? Or is this typical pain in a bear market? It's my first, can you tell?" So, this guy Andrew is living through his first bear market. And yes, there's plenty of precedent for this. Bear markets are painful. They're volatile. They test your discipline and your intestinal fortitude as a long-term investor. But here's the thing. If you're a young investor and this is your very first bear market, today's situation for you is far better than things were nine, twelve, eighteen months ago. The S&P 500 is now down a little more than 20%. Russell 2000, small cap stocks, is down almost 30%. The Nasdaq 100 is down more than 30%. Prices are on sale. And not only are prices lower, but you can find some yield on your cash for once. For years, the most asked question we got on Animal Spirits and some of our other platforms where we had email were, "What am I supposed to do with my cash savings? I'm earning zero yield. I want to save for a wedding. I want to save for a house. I want to just have my emergency fund, but I'm earning nothing in cash. There's no yield." Guess what? You can find some yield in your cash. One-and-two-year treasuries are yielding 4%. That means higher interest rates on your savings account, your CDs, short-term bond funds. Duncan, when I used to get my hair cut in high school, I went to a proper barber shop. Old school, four chairs, and lots of good conversation. But it was slow. And every time I went in, I'd have a scheduled time. My old barber Roger would say, "Hey, Ben, sorry. Service is down, but the quality's up." Every time, without fail. And I'd have to wait 20-30 minutes until he was done talking to someone. Great conversation. And then I'd sit in the corner and read a Sports Illustrated. This was before cell phones. I think it's similar today in the financial markets, especially for young people. Prices are down, but expected returns are up. Service is down, but the quality's up. If you're a young person in your 20s or 30s, you can expect to live through, I don't know, seven to eight brutal bear markets. Maybe two to three extreme, bone-crushing crashes. Maybe more, maybe less. But bear markets are great for people making regular contributions, because it means valuations are down, dividend yields are up. And this time, bond yields are up. Usually in a bear market, bond yields are down, because bonds typically go up when stocks go down. This time it's not happening that way. Listen, every bear market is unique in its own way. This one is different that way, because maybe rising rates are causing the stock bear market. But the emotions you feel during every bear market are the same, because human nature is the one constant. So, how do you survive these bear markets? I think especially for young people, it's just you have to automate. You put your contributions on autopilot, you rebalance periodically to make it automatic, and then each year you increase the amount you save. And for God's sake, don't worry about days and months in the market when you're in your 20s. Worry about decades, because that's your time horizon. Yeah, fair. That makes sense. Good advice. I recently got my hair cut, and I went to two places, and they were both completely full. The third one had no one in it, and it was a bad, bad idea. The barber was like a crazy person, but they cut my hair. So there's no line for a reason. Okay, that's fair. My wife finally made me, after the last couple of years, stop getting my hair cut at Great Clips for $9.99. Yeah, I mean, that's a good deal. It's a good deal. All right, got to save some. I'll probably double that now. All right, let's do a question from a viewer. Okay, so up first we have a question from Wes. In previous shows, I've heard you and Michael Batnick mention that you lease your vehicles. Would you be able to elaborate on when you think leasing a vehicle is most appropriate? Conventional financial wisdom says that cars are always viewed as liabilities, and this same wisdom almost frowns upon leasing a car. For context, I'm a recent college graduate with a great job who's moved from California to Colorado, where I'm contemplating buying a more expensive car that is suitable for the snow. I regularly contribute to my retirement accounts, but I do already have a car payment, student loans, and rent. I want to make sure I'm making a smart financial move if I choose to upgrade my car. All right, so one of the first things you need to learn as a young person, budgeting-wise, is fixed expenses matter way more than variable expenses. It's not your lattes and your eating out that matters. It's your fixed expenses. So that means, for most people, the biggest ones are going to be housing and transportation. So, John, throw up this tweet from this week from CarDealershipGuy. "New record this week. Percentage of consumers who finance a new car with a monthly payment over $1,000. So in June 2019, it was a little under 5%. Now it's fast approaching 13%. $1,000 for their monthly payment, which is just insane to me." And I get how it happens, because car prices are way up. People buy these huge SUVs and trucks. That's a hefty payment, yeah. That's huge. And that's a fixed payment. And that doesn't include things like insurance and gas and all these other ancillary costs that come with owning a car. And the price of a car, I know they've gone up in recent years, but most of the time, that's a depreciating asset. So, as a personal finance guy, I never thought I would've leased my automobile. But I did my first lease in 2015, because it was a great deal, thinking I could simply buy it when the contract ran up, back when there actually were good deals on cars. And so, I personally leased my Ford Explorer and have been leasing ever since then. And here's some of the reasons why I personally leased. And I think this is circumstantial. So my office is like four miles from my house, so I don't put a ton of mileage on the car. I have three kids, aged eight and under, and kids destroy the interior of a car. Peanuts and Cheerios and Goldfish everywhere. I would rather have the dealership take on that destruction. The payment is lower. Sure, I'll never go without a car payment, but it's a reasonable level, so I don't really mind it. I've had a lot of bad experiences with used cars over my lifetime. I've replaced transmissions, alternators, brake pads, brakes, tires, you name it, I've probably replaced it. Call me crazy, but I enjoy driving a new vehicle once every 36 months or so. The technology gets better. I don't think you can really beat the new car smell. That's kind of hard to beat. I don't know if that's worth it. That's worth the payment alone, right? That new car smell. But listen, leasing a car is certainly not for everyone. Those are my reasons. But if you want to run the numbers, there's this guy who emailed us in a while ago and said, "Hey, guy's name is Jesse Kramer. He has a blog called The Best Interest, and he wrote a fantastic blog post called The True Cost of Car Ownership." So he actually ran the numbers to figure out, if you want to figure out buy versus lease, here's the things that you should run the numbers on. Again, because a lot of it's circumstantial. First of all, it's how long you plan to drive the car and how far you drive it. He said depreciation is by far the biggest expense. So you can assume the car drops by 10% immediately driving it off the lot, and then an additional 10% each year for the next five years. Now, most new cars are covered for 36 months under warranty and maintenance, and after that you're on your own. So the cost of repairing an older car is estimated to be twice the amount for a new car. That's part of the reason that I lease. You also have to factor in the cost of fuel registration insurance. He says the average cost of owning a car is something in the range of $0.35 to $0.65 per mile over the life of the vehicle. So per mile driven. So assuming a car can last 15 years and go 200,000 miles, that would bring the cost of a $30,000 car to like $90,000 over the life of it, if you add everything up. Repairs, gas, insurance, maintenance, all this stuff. So he says that the premium for leasing is about 5% per mile. But you take the catastrophic thing off the table, where if you wreck the car and something goes really wrong, they'll take care of it. So I think the biggest things you have to figure out is how long do you want to drive the car for? How many miles a year do you drive it for? So if you're putting on 15,000, 20,000 miles a year, leasing doesn't make sense. If you want to trade up every few years, some people do, some people don't, it doesn't make sense to buy if you're going to trade up. And do you care if you have a car payment? Because the great thing about buying is once it's paid off, if you pay off in cash or just pay it off after three, four, five years of your term of your loan, then you don't have a car payment as long as you drive it. So I say no right or wrong answers here. I don't think that there is like a black and white. A lot of, like most things, it's pretty circumstantial. Depends on how much you want to drive it. Also, I was just going to mention, Jesse's often in the chat here on our very videos. I don't see him today. But so good Twitter follow. So go check out Jesse's stuff. Yeah. Sharp guy. All right. And Duncan, you should do a poll. Own versus lease in the thing here. I don't know how to do the polls. You do it. Yeah. I already did one, actually. Oh, you did one? Okay. Let me see if I can find what the result was. All right. I'll look for that. I'll look for that while you're talking next. All right. Let's do another one. All right. So up next, we have a question from Brandon. By the way, they just did an announcement that they're about to start vote testing. So we'll see. All right. Duncan's dealing with a fire alarm drill today. So if we hear anything in the background, that's why. It's always something. Yeah. Okay. So up next, we have a question from Brandon. I'm 24, single and have no kids. I'm currently hellbent on trying to buy a house with cash early in my life. I have $63,000 in my 401(k), $21,000 in my IRA, $5,000 in crypto, and $67,000 in a brokerage account. I also have $130,000 in cash on the sidelines. There's cash on the sidelines. Everyone's always talking about. My only debt is $15,000 of student debt, and payments aren't due until January, and the interest rate's 4.4%. Due to my income being high and living in a fairly inexpensive area, buying a house with cash is very realistic in four to six months. I'm currently paying $950 a month in rent, and my expenses are relatively low. That being said, I'm conflicted. Should I stay on this path, or should I put a lot more into the market? My 401(k) and IRA are maxed out for the year, but at current prices, it's a solid buying opportunity in my brokerage account with the cash I'm sitting on. At the same time, the psychological satisfaction of being mortgage-free would be great, and a saved income in the future may fuel my retirement faster. How would you handle this? Lewis: Alright, this is our not-to-brag of the week, for sure. 24 years old, doing really well. Lewis: Also, imagine how much that crypto was back a year and a half ago. Lewis: True. Yeah, it used to be $20,000, now it's $5,000. We get a lot of housing-related questions here at The Compound. Paying for a house in cash is obviously rare, but it's certainly a question we've gotten before. The interesting thing to me here is, my advice now versus 9-12 months ago is totally different, because mortgage rates. So, John, throw up the mortgage rates. This is Mortgage News Daily, publishes these daily. So, you can see, as of yesterday, 30-year fixed is approaching 6.5%. You can see, but they showed the 52-week range there is a low of 3. So, I think a year ago, you could have gotten a 30-year mortgage for like 2.9%, 3%. Man, it's just brutal when you think of that. So, I think if Brandon would have asked this question of mortgage rates at 3%, I would have said, "He's nuts. Why would you pay cash when you have a 3% mortgage that is going to be eaten away by inflation and that's such a low hurdle rate?" Plus, you have interest deduction you can take off. So, now, with mortgage rates at 7%, that's a much higher hurdle rate. I think it actually makes more sense. So, I guess the biggest worry here would be, am I going to miss out on some compounding in the stock market? Now, obviously, with the mortgage, you know exactly what that return is going to be. No one knows what it's going to be in the stock market. Houses are illiquid, but if you paid it in cash, you could always take a mortgage out or a home equity line of credit in the future if you need to, maybe if rates come back down, that makes sense. And I guess the other question is, how comfortable are you locking up that much cash in your home? That takes your diversification down significantly. One of the things we talk about here a lot is regret minimization. So, maybe Brandon has thought about, I don't know, pay 50% in cash for the house and invest the other 50% and split the difference somehow. There are some benefits to paying with cash. It puts you in a much better bargaining position. I talked a few months ago, Duncan, how I sold an investment property earlier this summer. The person who bought it from us bought in cash. And boy, not to pat myself on the back here, but I'm pretty sure I top ticked the market when I sold that. But the person who bought it bought it in cash, and it was so much easier. There's no banks to deal with. There's no credit agencies to deal with. There's no back and forth on paperwork. When you pay in cash, you don't have to deal with any of that stuff. So, the bargaining power goes up immediately, because the other side doesn't have to deal as much with the bank. So, it's not as much of a headache. Obviously, having a house fully paid off at 24 puts you in a unique position. Brandon says he's single. What happens if, down the road, Brandon gets a spouse? And that spouse says, "You bought this house for how much? I don't like it. I want to be in a different one." Maybe Brandon could rent it out, and that income could help pay for the new mortgage. Or sell it at a profit, maybe. So, the good news is that they're in a great financial position. I think no matter what you do here, you're going to be fine at 24. Especially if you continue maxing out that 401(k) and IRA. I did a little back of the envelope here for Brandon. So, if he's maxing out 401(k), that's $20,500 a year right now. IRA is $6,000. Those limits will change over time, but let's assume they don't. Let's assume Brandon, at 24, just continues to save that much every year. Nothing else. So, that's $26,500, from age 24 to age 60. Let's say he earns 7% a year on that. What does he end up with, Duncan? I've got to be honest, the firearm's going off, so I wasn't following. Alright. That's not that loud. If he did that every year at a 7% annual return, he's going to have like $4 million by age 60. So, I'd say don't stress too much about this decision either way. You're going to be fine. Go with a more psychologically pleasing answer. But either way, if you keep saving, you're going to be fine. So, if you're worried about the stock market that much, you're 24 and you're still maxing out your retirement accounts and you want to pay for the house in cash, I think you're going to be fine as long as you keep saving. Do you think that's a common goal for people that young to want to buy a house in cash? I don't even think that had ever crossed my mind. Well, we talked about that person a few weeks ago emailed from Missouri and they were paying like $300 a month in rent. I think a lot of people here would be surprised to know that you could buy a house in cash for that much and there's still places that are relatively affordable. So, obviously, this is a very rare position. But I think with their finances so well in their mid-20s, they're probably going to be fine either way. Just keep saving. Yeah, I'd say so. That's not too loud, right? That's just them talking now. It sounds like you're at an airport. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So, up next, we have the following. "I took advantage of a large dip and just opened a position in a market favorite, NVIDIA, with the intention of holding for 10 to 20 years. I'm writing far out of the money calls and returning the premium less a portion for taxes to the position each week. As a first time options trader, this seems too easy. What am I missing? What's the catch? Thanks, and can we get a TCAF hoodie in black?" I have good news. Well, the bad news is I have no idea what you're talking about with options. The good news is we just added the black hoodie back to the shop. So, your wish is granted. We also have a forest green one. Hey, you know something about options. You know what OTM meant. That's the first abbreviation you've known about. Trust me, I've lost plenty of money in options. I said on Animal Spirits this week, I've actually never, I guess it's for a future show, I've never traded an option in my life for some reason. So, let's look at the textbook definition here. So, a call option gives the holder of that option the right but not the obligation to buy security at a predetermined price, right? That's if you buy the option. Now, if you're a seller of the option, like this person, or a writer, I don't know why they call it writing, it's finance-speak, I guess. You're giving the buyer the option to buy your shares at a predetermined price. That seems like a free lunch, right? Those calls far out of the money, especially with a stock like NVIDIA that's so volatile, you're probably going to earn some pretty good premiums. Earn that sweet premium, and it feels like you're paying yourself an extra dividend stream, basically. So, what's the downside? Well, the downside is you want to hold this stock for 10 to 20 years. The downside is you could get taken out of these shares, right? You're obligated to sell those shares at the strike price, if it should hit. Now, option prices are based on a number of different variables, but one of the biggest variables is volatility. Generally speaking, the higher the volatility, the higher the price of the option. So, for you, that's good, because you're earning more income. But that could be bad, because the stock trades a lot. So, John, just throw up this chart of NVIDIA calendar year returns. This chart is just insane. Every single year for the past 12 years for NVIDIA, since 2012, has been a double-digit gain or loss. Six of the last eight years saw gains of 65% or more on a calendar year basis. Three of the last seven saw gains of 100% or more. And of course, this year it's down 55%. In 2018, it was down 31%. In 2012, it was down 11%. I guess that's what happens with a stock that's up so much. So, your risk is that you rate some call options, and the stock breaks through those levels, causing you to sell the shares. I guess you have to ask yourself, is the amount of income I'm earning on that worth the hassle? Does it, you know, tax-wise, making more purchases, wanting to keep your position at a specific size? So, that's the cost-benefit there. Is the income stream I'm getting really worth the hassle of having to go through this and potentially buy back more shares if you want to keep that position where it is if you're going to be a holder for 10 to 20 years? To me, it's just hilarious. Every time I buy an option, it moves against me immediately. I could probably harness that intuition and actually use it somehow to make money in the stock market. George Costanza, do the opposite. Yeah, exactly. Every time. Every time. I think for most people, trading options is kind of like gambling on sports. The great thing about it is, you know exactly what you're going to get. It's like a parlay, basically. You could put a little bit of money up, and if it's right, you earn a bunch of money. If it's wrong, you just lose what you put up. I think that's the way most people these days in retail probably look at options, whereas professionals are looking at them more as a risk management tool and hedging and all these sorts of things. It sounds like this person is actually looking at them for income. Yeah. No, it sounds like whatever they're doing is working so far. Hopefully, it continues to work for them. Maybe that income is helping for Nvidia shares continuing to fall and get slotted this year. Right, yeah. Next question. Okay, up next, we have a question from Christy. "My husband and I are 34 and 40 years old, healthy and planning on starting our family. We don't own a home yet, but hope to buy in two to three years. We have about $100,000 in assets between vehicles, retirement, and savings. As we start our family, should we set up a last will or a living trust estate plan? What do you think is better for this particular point in our lives, and why?" Hopefully, Christy and her husband will have a chance to buy houses at much lower prices if the Fed keeps raising rates. Let's bring in an estate planning expert here, Taylor Hollis from Red Bulls Wealth. She's been on the show before. Taylor's worked in estates. All right. Christy and her husband do not have a family yet, but they're looking to start one soon. They're getting ahead of the game here, I think. What are they thinking about in terms of estate planning? When do you need to start thinking about this as a young person? Yeah. I think the sooner, the better. Typically, even if you're not married, if you have any assets at all to your name, I think it always makes sense to have some sort of basic will in place just to give you control over what happens to those assets if you pass away. Their question in particular is asking about the difference between setting up a living trust or just a basic will. I think that a living trust, which is also known as a revocable trust, is typically, in most cases, set up for two reasons. One, if there's a privacy concern, and two, to avoid probate in the estate settlement court, and specifically if you have property in multiple states. Are those concerns mostly for people who have a lot of money and a lot of assets then? Typically, yeah. Just more complex. It's just a more complex situation. Typically, a living trust would make more sense. In their case, it sounds like a will can definitely accomplish what they need it to. The good news, a lot of people think they don't need to set up a will until they have kids, or until they own a home, or whatever it might be. Typically, attorneys can write the will in a way that covers all those future plans. It'll cover your future children. You can go ahead and factor all those things in now so that you're not having to redo it. What's the simplest way for people to do this if they don't have a lawyer on call or something? How do people even go about this these days? I always defer to hiring an attorney for this. You can find attorneys these days that specialize in these simpler cases. Most people think they don't need an attorney if they do have a fairly simple situation, and they're like, "Can I just go on LegalZoom and do this?" Technically, yes, probably you could, but just as a professional, I always prefer people to actually work with an attorney on it. I think it's going to be less expensive than people may think if they find the right person. Okay, that makes sense. All right, Duncan, one more question. Yeah, last but not least. I think the firearm's done. I think we did it. We made it. We made it. Way to go. The loudest part of it, I think I was on mute for, so yeah. Okay, so last but not least, we have a question from Jason. "I'm a 37-year-old single male with $385,000 in my retirement accounts, $277,000 in my current company, 401(k), and $117,000 in my rollover IRA. I hope to be with my current company for many years to come. They have a 401(k) match of 100% up to 10%." That's really good, right? Up to 10%, yeah. 10% is a really good match, yes. Really good. "I maxed out my 401(k) in 2021, and I'm currently doing a mega backdoor Roth conversion. I call it an extra $35,000 over the max over a two-year span. After some due diligence," is that DD? I think that's what it'll concern, yep. "After some due diligence on my rollover IRA, it has underperformed by roughly 7% compared to the S&P, and I'm paying professional fees of about $1,000 a year to Fidelity. I'm thinking I should take control and throw it all in a low-cost S&P fund and call it a day, or considering I can only contribute $6,000 a year into this and will be contributing much more in my 401(k), I could be more aggressive. Perhaps a mixture of S&P and also mid- and small-cap exposure. Would love your insights." A lot going on here. Now, sometimes we have to shorten these questions. This person also did ask, just generally, "How am I doing for retirement here?" Because they gave us a lot of information. And I think, "How am I doing?" is pretty much the only question that matters for the majority of people who are saving, if you're not uber-wealthy, if you don't have a ton of money, just FU money. I think a lot of people want to know just how they're doing. I think Jason is doing pretty good for the amount of money they saved, and they're by themselves, and they're getting this huge max. So, the question is, it sounds like they're on the right path, but they're just unsure. I think that happens to a lot of people, Taylor. Because there's so many options out there, I could be using Advisor, I could be having a different asset allocation, I could be using different funds. I think for a lot of people it's tempting to always think, "There's got to be more out there. What am I not doing? What could I be doing differently?" So, how do you help someone sort through all this stuff when they have six figures saved, it sounds like a pretty good plan, they're a pretty good saver, but then they need to take that extra step to make sure, "Is everything I'm doing, am I going to be okay?" Right, right. Yep. Very common question. A lot of FOMO, I think, baked into that for sure. He might not like this answer, but my first response to his question is, "What are your goals? You're young, you're an aggressive saver, you have a good pool of assets built up. Are you trying to retire early? Are you trying to be able to start your own business? What's the end goal?" And then let's work backwards from there, both in terms of your saving, which obviously you're doing a great job of, but especially your asset allocation in the investment plan. And I think that taking a holistic approach obviously makes a lot of sense. I think there's some mental accounting happening here. He mentioned, "Should my rollover IRA be more aggressive because it's smaller and I'm putting less into it?" To me, that doesn't necessarily matter and it should be viewed altogether. I think if anything, your Roth component that you're building up through these mega backdoor contributions should be your most aggressive because you're theoretically never have to take money out of that. So in just a basic sense, we typically like to see the Roth as the more aggressive bucket. And then my next question in terms of his concerns on performance would be, "Well, what was it invested in that caused it to underperform?" But again, I think coming back to what your end goal is, what you're trying to accomplish is going to help you set an appropriate benchmark for yourself instead of just the market. I feel like mega backdoor Roth is kind of like the sizes at Starbucks. Can we just call it a large Roth conversion? It's like a Venti. This is like a Venti Roth IRA. I don't know. Someone did some good branding on that strategy. Yes. It sounds like you're doing a lot with your money. Sounds like Transformers. So he said that he's paying an advisor to help him and he's underperforming. And I think maybe the question for that advisor is not, "Why am I underperforming?" It could just be because maybe they're invested in international funds and international funds are doing worse than the S&P. It's, "Can you help me put together an asset allocation that I can live with, that I won't question all the time?" So maybe that's the question. If that advisor can't do it for you, maybe you have to find a new one or come up with something on your own. But that's the thing for most people. There is no such thing as a perfect asset allocation. It's, "What's the asset allocation that I can stick with that I'm not going to tinker with, I'm not going to leave it alone?" I think the old saying, William Bernstein said it, "Asset allocation is like a piece of soap. The more you use it and fondle it and touch it, the smaller it's going to get." That's the same thing with your portfolio. Sorry, I didn't mean to use the word "fondle." But I think we talked last week, too, for younger people in their 30s, if this person doesn't have a really complicated situation, maybe they don't even need an advisor, as long as they can figure out an allocation. And the other thing is, maybe you go backwards and go to a target date fund and let someone else handle that for you, and you don't have to think about it anymore. Right. I think it sounds like he's doing all the right things. He's doing the things he's in control of, and that's saving a lot of money. Again, determine what the purpose is, what the goal is. Because with all of his savings, it sounds to me like maybe he wants to retire early. Yeah, and that's the question in terms of, "How am I doing?" You're right. Focusing on what you can control in saving, for most people, that's the biggest piece. Right now, we can't control the Fed, we can't control interest rates, we can't control the stock market, and all that stuff is completely out of our control. Tax rates, none of that. But if you can actually increase your savings in a time like this, that's pretty good. So I think, as far as I'm concerned, they're doing pretty good. I was laughing because Toby in the chat said, "I hope this guy finds a way to make ends meet." (laughs) Everyone has their cross to bear here. Listen, we get a wide range of questions from people, and I know it is easy to judge people, but listen, we have people who have -- Jason will laugh at that. He'll find that funny. Yes. But we have people who have 10 figures in assets, and they constantly check their portfolio and they're worried about it. And one of the things that I say is, if you're still worried about your money, you're probably not wealthy in that sense. So I think for a lot of people, it's not the numbers so much that make sense, it's how they feel relative to their circumstances and all these things, and it's tough. So anyway. I think everyone on the questions today is doing a good job, right? Yes. No, we had some great ones. Keep them coming. And now that we're not doing viewer topics on what are your thoughts, we've made Portfolio Rescue that much more valuable. This is the place you come to have your questions answered. It's a premium show, Duncan. Yes. We're a premium show now. All right. I want to thank Taylor Hollis again for joining us. Thanks, Taylor. From Nashville, Tennessee. We appreciate that. Thanks to everyone who was watching live in the chat. We appreciate you all. If you have a podcast for him, leave us a review. If you're on YouTube, leave us a comment, a question in the comment section. If you want some compound work, Duncan just said, breaking news, a new Compound & Friends sweatshirt, black sweatshirt, now available. It's yeah, it's the same sweatshirt design. But yeah, we now have it. We had it in white for the summer. Now it's black and we have a forest green one. Very cool. All right. And we'll have a new Compound & Friends tomorrow. Is that right? Right. We're doing it live from Market Watch's festival today. And so it's going to be basically the program feed from that. Lots of live shows lately. Remember, if you have a question, email us askthecompoundshow@gmail.com and we will see you next week. See everyone.  you</p></div></div></body></html>
