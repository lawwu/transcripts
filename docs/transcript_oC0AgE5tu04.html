Somebody said, what are some of the myths about the NBA? Man, I think this was a myth for me coming in something I believe. But I think it's also a misconception that a lot of people believe. And it's that everybody like works really, really hard. I think like you have to be talented and you have to be gifted and you have to work hard to get here.</p><p>But a lot of people don't work on their game, don't work on their bodies, don't work on staying healthy, don't put the time in recovery as much as you would think. Like I have always been, as you know, super, super like dedicated. And I love to work hard, but I feel like that's not the case for every NBA player.</p><p>I think I also was forced into it with my injury situation. I had to take care of my body. I had to get my recovery in and all that. But yeah, I think that's the misconception. Because even people that I worked with in Denver, they would see me in the gym every night.</p><p>And they would say like, man, before I got to the NBA and before I was working with NBA players, I thought everybody worked hard like you do. And I was like, me too. I thought the same thing. But, you know, there's a lot of talented players, a lot of gifted players.</p><p>But I think that would be the misconception that is not always true. Now, you got the dudes that are super dedicated. Bron has been in the league 20 years, I've heard, 20 some years. His body, like, you have the dudes that are tremendous workers. But you also have the dudes that are chilling for real, you know?</p><p>And especially, sometimes once you get paid, you know, you see guys kind of chill out a little bit.</p></div></div></body></html>
