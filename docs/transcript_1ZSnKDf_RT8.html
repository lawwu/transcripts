A lot of the dentists I've been talking to for a long time, and I would say about 50%, have told me that all of these things that I had done, extractions, braces, headgear, retainers, what they do, it's like foot binding, like the ancient art of foot binding.</p><p>You take a kid's mouth that's too small for his face because his teeth are crooked, right? And you remove teeth, and then you crane the remaining teeth back and let the rest of the head grow, what's gonna happen? And so many dentists are saying, this is one of the primary reasons so many people are suffering from breathing problems, because their airways have been constricted, their jaws are set back like this.</p><p>They had one goal, straighten this kid's teeth at any cost, at any cost to their mouth, their airway, the rest of their face, and that's what they did. And this all came about in the 1940s, this production line dentistry, It was never done this way.</p></div></div></body></html>
