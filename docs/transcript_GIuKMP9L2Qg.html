I feel like sometimes it can be easy to just speak off the cuff. Do you have any tips for kind of restraining to really hone and focus when you kind of know the answer, but if you took a minute, you could piece together an even more profound response?</p><p>- When you're in a situation and you're listening, actually make sure you're listening to the person, not formulating your response in the moment. I think there's a point in time, you know, when you've kind of gotten the gist of what someone is saying, when you kind of turn to, okay, now I'm like, I'm listening, but I'm also creating the narrative of what I'm gonna say in my mind.</p><p>But it's usually later than you think. Most people, I think, stop listening very, very quickly in someone's dialogue. Learning to like uncomfortably push that back a little bit and listen a little bit longer, I find that you learn a lot more from the other person. And then as a result, you end up coming up with more insightful responses.</p></div></div></body></html>
