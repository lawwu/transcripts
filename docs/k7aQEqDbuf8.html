And I popped in a tape and there was an interview on the Ivory Keenan Wayans show,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7aQEqDbuf8&t=1989" target="_blank">00:33:09.780</a></span> | <span class="t">right? The oldest Wayans brother and he had a talk show at the time. And he had Joe Rogan,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7aQEqDbuf8&t=1995" target="_blank">00:33:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">the guy from Fear Factor on the show.

And he was talking about what UFC fighters would do to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7aQEqDbuf8&t=2015" target="_blank">00:33:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">these martial arts guys if they ever got their hands on them. And I was like, "This is exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7aQEqDbuf8&t=2021" target="_blank">00:33:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">what I need. A guy who isn't afraid to speak his mind and knows the sport inside and out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7aQEqDbuf8&t=2029" target="_blank">00:33:49.860</a></span> | <span class="t">but more importantly, is super passionate about it and loves it." So when you see Joe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7aQEqDbuf8&t=2034" target="_blank">00:33:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Rogan on camera, and I was talking about the paid dock talking heads that they had in HBO Boxing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7aQEqDbuf8&t=2039" target="_blank">00:33:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">that were terrible. Joe Rogan does not come off as a paid talking head. He comes off as a guy who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7aQEqDbuf8&t=2045" target="_blank">00:34:05.860</a></span> | <span class="t">loves this. And so early on, no media would cover us. So I had to buy my way onto radio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7aQEqDbuf8&t=2054" target="_blank">00:34:14.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'd do these radio tours, right? And they would drop us in. You'd have to get up at 3.30</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7aQEqDbuf8&t=2061" target="_blank">00:34:21.300</a></span> | <span class="t">in the morning in Vegas on the West Coast. And they, 'cause they're at 6.30 in the morning in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7aQEqDbuf8&t=2067" target="_blank">00:34:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">New York and Boston and Florida and all these other places. So they drop you into these markets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7aQEqDbuf8&t=2072" target="_blank">00:34:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">to do radio, right? And the fighters were horrible at it. Fighters getting up at 3.30 in the morning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7aQEqDbuf8&t=2079" target="_blank">00:34:39.140</a></span> | <span class="t">especially leading up to a fight, never good.
