I think the second city, like as a general rule, it's going to be more affordable, you're going to have less foreigners, so more of a chance to meet local people who maybe aren't overwhelmed with how many foreigners there are.</p><p>So like right now in Korea, I'm talking to you from Busan, which is the second city, and I can list a lot of advantages over going to Seoul because of how more of an authentic experience I'm having, but still having the comforts of being in a city. Obviously you're going to be even more authentic if you go to a village somewhere, but the city life I happen to enjoy, so the second city in a lot of countries, I'm a huge fan of basing myself there for a certain period of time to get to know the culture in a different way, and generally I tend to be one of the few foreigners who is in that city to be able to have a bit more of an authentic experience.</p></div></div></body></html>
