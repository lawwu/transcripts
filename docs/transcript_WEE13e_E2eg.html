And that's honestly the reason that I wanted to get into Citi's program was hotels and the Eva Air availability. Notably, Citi gets choice hotels, which is also part of Amex, also part of Cap One, but you get a one to two ratio instead of on those programs, you get a one to one.</p><p>So twice as many choice points. Wells Fargo Rewards similarly has a one to two choice points. I'll brush on Wells Fargo in a little bit, but the access to some preferred hotels, which are some nice luxury hotels, is interesting. There are also a ton of choice hotels. They don't have the most luxurious portfolio.</p><p>There are some really nice Radisson Blues, Cambria, Ascends, but for the most part, I would say compared to other hotel chains, the shining star of choice is not hotels if you're looking to stay in really luxury properties. But if you are, Citi also has preferred hotels and leading hotels of the world.</p></div></div></body></html>
