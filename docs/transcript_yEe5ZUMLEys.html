Okay, this will be an interesting experiment.  And everybody in the forum looks okay, great.  And I am recording, so that's good too.  So I'm going to go back to SDI dev, dev.  We were looking at, wait.  All right, so we need to make sure we get Paul.  As we're always changing stuff.  And restart.  Okay, so where we're up to is we learn how to create basically a function. But actually something that derives from transform. But it just, it looks exactly like a function. So you pass it an argument. Transform will send that off to the encodes method. Kind of like how nn.module in PyTorch passes it off to a forward method. And it will calculate the result of the function and return it. And then we also learned that something which works that way. You can also optionally add a decodes. Which will, basically something that you undo that transform. Or at least enough that you can display it. And so that has to return something which has a show method. But that's just a function basically. And then we learned that you can pipeline functions. Which basically just means that you are composing functions together. Or transforms. And the interesting thing in this one is that when you return a tuple.  It will.  Then let you, things after that. You can make them tuple transforms. And it will apply the function only to those items in the tuple individually. That are of this requested type. I think we have one unnecessary annotation here. Let me check.  Yep. Okay. So. Yes. You can decode from pipeline. That's kind of the whole point really. Is that a pipeline that encodes can also decode. So you can see here. For instance. So we could go. T equals pipe zero. And so there's T.</p></div></div></body></html>
