The feeling is it's like 9 PM and you've been working on a thing all day and it's almost working. It's almost working. And you know, if you just debug this one thing, then your project will be done and you'll be able to like go to, so you're like, well, I'll just stay up and I'll debug this one last thing.</p><p>And then you start debugging it and you get it and you solve it. And that feels great. And then immediately you run into one more thing. Like, oh, it's almost running all the way through. It's almost going end to end. And you're like, well, I'll just stay up a little bit longer.</p><p>And you know, before you know it, it's like 2 AM and you keep going cause it, it feels so good. Like you, you feel the sense of forward progress. You're not just staring at a wall. I think like for the programming problems where you are at a brick wall, it doesn't feel like this.</p><p>It feels bad. Um, so can every field be transformed into something where you can feel the sense of forward progress? You can get this rapid feedback cycle. I think that's really hard.</p></div></div></body></html>
