They will want something for years. They'll want it deep in their soul. And then when presented with the opportunity to get the very thing they have talked about, dreamed about, agonized about, they will become skeptical. I see it all the time. I have people in my community, they talk about starting a business.</p><p>They've wanted to start a business for six years. They follow 13 people on social, three on newsletter, two on podcast. And they'll say, I don't have an idea. I don't have this. We have a program that does exactly that. And they'll get to the sales page. It has literally every single question they could ever conceivably come up with.</p><p>And then suddenly they start going, will it do this? Will it help a left-handed person who lives south of the equator, but only between September and October? Even with me, when I first started trying to get fit, I had thought about it, talked about it, played around with weights.</p><p>I didn't know what I was doing. Finally, when faced with the opportunity to actually get a personal trainer and learn how this worked, I started debating it. Oh, should I do this? Will it be hard? What about injuries? Blah, blah, blah. It's just a human</p></div></div></body></html>
