And then if you want to talk about it after we can. - Sounds good. - The reason I started doing this is I have relatively low heart rate variability and you want to have a higher one. So I looked at all the things that can raise your heart rate variability and I started doing this breathing technique specifically for heart rate variability, then it went up. - Awesome. - So it's tested. - Great. - Let's do it together here. It'll say, take a deep breath. And then when you'll hear the sound of a, if you follow me for the first inhale and exhale, you'll know what sound means. - And you do this eyes closed typically? - I do it eyes closed. - Okay, we'll close our eyes. - Thank you.

I notice I don't spontaneously breathe at that cadence. I breathe quite a bit faster. So especially on the exhale. So once I got into a rhythm of it, yeah, the mind just goes pseudo random for me. What about for you? Does your mind tend to go one place? - I do. Now I count. So the reason I knew it was five minutes is because it's six breaths per minute. And I counted five, one, one, one, two, one, three, one, four, one, five, one, six, two, one. So I was occupied with a task. - How often do you do that? - At least once and sometimes twice a day. I aim for 10 minutes a day, but if I get to 20 minutes a day, it's noticeable in my heart rate variability results. - Do you do the coherence breathing at a particular times of day or just whenever it occurs to you? - I think it depends on where I am and what else is going on in my life. So I had a window of a very specific thing that I was doing. I would do coherent breathing and I would do squats, just air squats in one location where I didn't have any other equipment. And then I found a way where I was doing treading water, which you got to experience with me. I would tread water and then after treading water, I would get out of the pool, sit in the sun and do the coherent breathing. (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music)</p></div></div></body></html>
