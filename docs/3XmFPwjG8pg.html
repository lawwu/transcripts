I thought this was awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, just the other day, Gemini beat Pokémon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=43" target="_blank">00:00:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I like seeing the little robots with AGI on top of their head.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That must mean that we're already there, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, if we have these agents playing Pokémon and it's already doing it and beating it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that means the game's over, right? We're all done?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, not quite. Because, with Claude Place Pokémon, we saw that it would get stuck in the same place for three days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It would need interventions. It would hallucinate different actions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And not only that, there was a ton of Pokémon training data that was within the model itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, although this is a really cool example about an agent exploring a world, there are a lot of things that we can go and improve on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, as Kyle was saying, my name is Greg Kamrad, President of ArcPrize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We are a non-profit with the mission to be a North Star guide towards Open AGI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We were founded last year by Francois Chollet and Mike Knup.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, just last December, we were invited by OpenAI to join them on their live stream to co-announce the 03 preview results on Arc AGI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, there's a lot of AI benchmarking companies out there, but we take a very opinionated approach as to how we should do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And our opinion is that the best target we should be aiming for is actually humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why we think that is because we see that humans are the one proof point of general intelligence that we know about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if we use humans as the target, that does two things for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because what we do is we come up with problems that are feasible for humans, but hard for AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, while we do that, that does two things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Number one is it creates a gap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you have that gap, you can start to measure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, how many problems can we come up with that humans can still do, but AI can't?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then number two is it guides research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you can quantify that class of problems and then go tell researchers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"Hey, there's something really interesting going on on this side of the problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's something that we need to go check out from there."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Alright?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if we're going to measure artificial general intelligence based off of humans,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we need to actually define, well, what is general intelligence?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's two definitions that I love to quote.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The first one was by John McCarthy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he says that AI is the science and engineering of making machines do tasks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and this is the important part, that they have never seen beforehand and they have not prepared for beforehand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is very important because if you've seen a class of problem beforehand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">if it's already in your training data, then you're simply just repeating memorization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're not actually learning anything new on the fly, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The second person I'd like to quote on this is actually Francois himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he put it very eloquently within just three words.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he calls intelligence skill, acquisition, efficiency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is really beautiful here because skill, acquisition, can you learn new things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And not only that, but how efficiently can you learn those new things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And humans are extremely, spoiler, humans are extremely efficient at learning these new things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Francois proposed this definition in his 2019 paper on the measure of intelligence,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but he went further than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He didn't just define it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He actually proposed the benchmark to see can a human or an AI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">can it learn something new and then go repeat what it learned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is where the ArcGi version one benchmark came out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So over here on the left hand side, this is the learn the skill portion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is what we call the training portion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we show you is a transformation from an input to an output grid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the goal for the human or the AI is to look at it and say, hmm, what's going on here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then on the left, we actually ask you to demonstrate that skill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a little mini skill you learn on the left and we ask you to demonstrate it on the right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you can successfully do it, and this is what it looks like, it's just the grid editor here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">then yes, you've learned what the transformation is and you've actually applied this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you're showing a non-zero level of generalization as you go through this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So our benchmarks, ArcGi 2, this is the most recent one, it has over a thousand tasks in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the important part here is each one of these tasks is novel and unique.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I mean by that is, the skills required for one of them, we will never ask you to apply that same skill to another task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is very important because we're not testing whether or not you can just repeat the skill you've already learned,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but we want to test all the little mini skills that you can do over time and see if you can actually demonstrate those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if we're going to back up that humans can actually do this, well, we need to go get first party data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So our group as a nonprofit, we went down to San Diego and we tested over 400 people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So rented a bunch of computers and we did this in person to prefer to have data privacy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we made sure that every single task that was included in ArcGi was solvable by people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this isn't just an aim here, we're actually doing the work to go and do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if we think about it, there's actually quite a bit of human-like intelligence that's out of scope from what we call a single turn type of benchmark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">With ArcGi, you have all the information presented that you need right at test time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't need to do any exploring or anything and it's all through single turn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we're going to be measuring any human-like intelligence, and I would argue that if you are going to measure human-like intelligence,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it needs to be interactive by design.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what you need to have is you need to be able to test the ability of an agent, whether that be biological or artificial,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to explore an open world, understand what goals it needs to do, and ultimately look at the rewards and go from there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is actually very in line with what Rich Sutton had just published within his paper, "Welcome to the Era of Experience."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he argues that if we want agents that will be readily adaptable to the human world, they need to engage with the open world, they need to collect observational data, and they need to be able to take that data to build a world model and make their own rules and really understand what it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or else you're just going to have the human data ceiling going forward from here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If we're going to be able to build this, we're going to need a new type of benchmark that gets out of the single turn realm, and this is where interactive reasoning benchmarks are going to come in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now an interactive reasoning benchmark is going to be a benchmark where you have a controlled environment, you have defined rules, and you may have sparse rewards where an agent needs to navigate to understand what is going on in order to explore and complete the objective from here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now there's an open question as to all right, if our aim is interactive reasoning benchmarks, what is the medium in which we're going to actually execute these benchmarks in?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it turns out that actually games are quite suitable for interactive reasoning benchmarks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason for this is games, they're a very unique set of intersection of complex rules, defined scope, and you have large flexibility into creating these types of environments that you can then go put different artificial systems in or biological systems with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I know what you may be asking here, wait, Greg, didn't we already do games? Didn't we do this 10 years ago? We already went through the Atari phase.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, yes, we did, but there's actually a huge amount of issues with what was going on during that realm there, not even just starting with all the dense rewards that come with the Atari games.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There was a ton of irregular reporting, so everybody would put their own performance on these different scales and was tough to compare these models with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There was no hidden test set that came, and then one of my biggest gripes with the Atari phase was that all the developers, they already knew what the Atari games were.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they were able to inject their own developer intelligence into their models themselves, and then all of a sudden the intelligence of the performance, well, that's getting barred from the developer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not actually getting done by the model itself from there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we were able to create a benchmark that overcame these shortcomings, well, then we'd be able to make a capabilities assertion about the model that beat it that we've never been able to make beforehand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so to put it another way that's a bit more visual, we know that AI can beat one game. This is proved. AI can beat chess. AI can beat Go. We've seen this many, many, many times here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we know that AI can beat 50 known games with unlimited compute and unlimited training data. We've seen this happen with Agent 57 and Mute Zero.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the assertion that we want to make is, well, what if AI beat 100 games that the system has never seen beforehand and the developer has never actually seen beforehand either?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If we were able to successfully put a test or put AI to this test, then we could make the capabilities assertion about that AI that we don't currently have in the market right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm excited to say that that's exactly what Arc is going to go build. So this is going to be our version three benchmark. Today is a sneak preview about what that's going to look like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is going to be our first interactive reasoning benchmark that is going to come from Arc. And I want to jump into three reasons why it's very unique here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first one is much like our current benchmark, we're going to have a public training and a public evaluation set. So the reason why this is important with our public training, call it on the order of about 40 different novel games.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This will be where the developer and the AI can understand the interface and understand kind of what's going on here. But all performance reporting will happen on the private evaluation set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is very important because on this private evaluation set, there's no internet access allowed. So no data is getting out about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The scores that come out of private evaluation set will have been done by an AI that has never seen these games beforehand and neither has the developer seen them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can authoritatively say that this AI has generalized to these open domains here. Now, the second important point about what ArcGIS 3 is going to have is it's going to force understanding through exploration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One of my other gripes with current game benchmarks out there is you give a lot of instruction to the actual AI itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, hey, you're in a racing game, or hey, you're in an FPS, go control the mouse and do all these things. We're going to drop AI and humans into this world, and they won't know what's going on until they start exploring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So even as I look at this screenshot, this is actually one of our first games, we call it Locksmith. We give all of our games a cool little name like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As I look at this, I don't know what's going on, right? But I start to explore and I start to understand, oh, there's certain things I need to pick up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There may be walls, there may be goals and objectives. I'm not sure what those goals and objectives are right when I first start, but that's the point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So not only are we going to ask humans to explore and make up their own rules as to understand how to do the game, but we're going to require the same thing for AI as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's something that we're not currently seeing from the reasoning models that we have from there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the third key point is that we're only going to require core knowledge priors only. This is something that we carry from ArcGIS 1 and 2 as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But what this means is, you'll notice the ArcTasks, there's no language, there's no text that's being involved here, there's no symbols, and we're not asking you any trivia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I call these other benchmarks that rely on these, sometimes we try to make the hardest problems possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We go hire the best people in the world, and I call them PhD++ problems, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's great, but AI is already superhuman, it's way smarter than me in a lot of different domains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We take the alternative approach, which is let's look at more of the floor and look at the reliability side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's take anything outside of core knowledge and strip those away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So core knowledge priors, the four of them that there are, are basic math.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And these are things that are humans that we're either born with or hardwired to gather immediately after birth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So basic math, meaning counting up to 10. Basic geometry, so understanding different shapes and topology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then agentness, which is understanding theory of mind, that there's other types of agents out there in the world that I know that they're interacting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the fourth one is objectness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So as we create our benchmark, these are the four principles that we like to go after when we try to test the abstract and reasoning piece.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I was reading the recent Darkesh essay, and he actually put it really well in one of his paragraphs here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He was talking about one of the reasons why humans are great, and he says it's their ability to build up context, interrogate their own failures, and pick up small improvements and efficiencies as they practice a task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't yet have this type of environment that can go and test this from a benchmark perspective for AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is exactly what ArcGIS is going to go build.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So before we wrap it up here, I want to talk about how we're going to evaluate AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it's like, okay, cool, they go play the game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, what does it mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you know if it's doing well or it's not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're going to bring it back to Francois' definition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to bring it back to skill acquisition efficiency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're going to use humans, which again, is our only proof point of general intelligence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to use humans as the baseline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to go and test hundreds of humans on these exact Arc tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're going to measure how long does it take them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How many actions does it take them to complete the game?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we're going to get a human baseline and we're going to be able to measure AI in the same exact way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So can the AI explore the environment, intuit about it, create its own goals and complete the objectives faster than humans?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, if it cannot, I would go as far as to assert that we do not yet have AGI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And as long as we can come up with problems that humans can still do but machines cannot, I would again assert that we do not have AGI with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to be looking at skill acquisition efficiency as our main output metric here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XmFPwjG8pg&t=824"
