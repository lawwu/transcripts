href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I met a teacher in Los Angeles in 2003</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is that you need to do all these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to let go of this and notice that</span></div><div

sky</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and focus on your breath and vision the white light.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And you don't need to do any of that stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, it works a lot better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I say better, I mean you have more delightful experiences</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.880</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">And ultimately, if you can do nothing and just practice pure being,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=145"

target="_blank">00:02:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I learned how to operate in concert with my thinking mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was a big game changer for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

the fight flight,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to actually

target="_blank">00:07:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're supposed to be thinking about the fact that you're meditating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, he said don't do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

some sort of anchor point to come back to, whether it's your breath,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=482"

things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you can have the most profound

if you continue exposing yourself to this state,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.320</a></span> | <span

I do one - there's like five to 10 lifts and I'm focusing on resistance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=3730" target="_blank">01:02:10.300</a></span> | <span class="t">training now because it's just important for maintaining muscle mass. But there's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=3735" target="_blank">01:02:15.300</a></span> | <span class="t">five to 10 lifts that you can do that basically hits the whole body over the course of doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=3741" target="_blank">01:02:21.260</a></span> | <span class="t">those five to 10 lifts.

So, for instance, squatting. Squatting affects your legs, it affects your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=3759" target="_blank">01:02:39.460</a></span> | <span class="t">core and it affects your back. So, squatting is you standing underneath a bar on a squat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=3765" target="_blank">01:02:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">rack and you just bending your knees and squatting down as much as is comfortable and coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=3772" target="_blank">01:02:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">back - pressing back up.

So, I do one exercise, five</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=3780" target="_blank">01:03:00.260</a></span> | <span class="t">sets of five squats and I go for progressive overload, which means doing a little bit more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=3785" target="_blank">01:03:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">each time and that's it. That's all I do. So, the whole workout takes me like 20 minutes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=3790" target="_blank">01:03:10.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and then I leave the gym.

Instead of going five,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1PiBtLiL9Y&t=3818" target="_blank">01:03:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">four, three, two, one or one, two, three, four, five, I'll do an affirmation.
