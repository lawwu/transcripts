My understanding is that within a species, evolving new traits</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bELy17kYokg&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is very slow, but mutations arise, like the OB mutation, and then you can get very fat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bELy17kYokg&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">versions of an animal very quickly, right?

So, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bELy17kYokg&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.540</a></span> | <span class="t">can happen very quickly within a species.

Yet, it's also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bELy17kYokg&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.540</a></span> | <span class="t">true what I said, that body weight is extremely heritable. It's one of the most heritable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bELy17kYokg&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">features and something on the order of 80%. The only thing, one of the only things we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bELy17kYokg&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">know about that's actually more heritable than body weight is height, right? Most diseases</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bELy17kYokg&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">are not as heritable as body weight. How can you explain that? And the idea is this, there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bELy17kYokg&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">a distribution of body weights among people. So, in any given society at any point in time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bELy17kYokg&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.260</a></span> | <span class="t">some people are going to be leaner, some people are going to be more obese. That distribution,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bELy17kYokg&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">where you lie on that distribution, is determined primarily by genetics. So, you may be the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bELy17kYokg&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">person who has the thrifty genes, so that basically cause you to save energy, and so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bELy17kYokg&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you would be more on the obese side. Or you may be a person who has different genes that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bELy17kYokg&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">cause you to be a little bit less hungry, so you would be on the leaner side. What environment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bELy17kYokg&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">does is then it shifts that whole distribution, so that basically the mean shifts so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bELy17kYokg&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone becomes, or most people become heavier.

So, basically genetics</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bELy17kYokg&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">sets your propensity, and then environment can basically unmask that. And so, as we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bELy17kYokg&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">had this change in environment where there's all of this, and we don't know exactly what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bELy17kYokg&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the things are that have changed that are important, but there's all this ultra-processed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bELy17kYokg&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">food, highly palatable food, just various other things that you mentioned, seed oils,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bELy17kYokg&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">who knows if that's important.

It's still because of genetics,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bELy17kYokg&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but it also requires the environmental component.
