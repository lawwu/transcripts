And that would cause deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">procrastination. It's important to try to differentiate this from depression. They're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">similar, but it's not quite the same thing. So with depression, it's much more broad in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">its impact. So with with depression, which also, of course, is common among students,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">especially at these elite schools, you go a hedonic, so you can't imagine finding pleasure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or happiness in anything. That's why depression is so insidious. Deep procrastination is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">more focused.

In fact, there might be things you really love doing. You're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like, I don't know, I'm reading instead and going to these movies, and why am I even in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">school?

Whereas depression is more of a fritzing out of the entire ability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to have optimism or hope or feel like you're ever going to enjoy anything ever again. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">depression tends to come more from, you go through a period of heavy negative self-talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and rumination. So there's sort of a different path to depression that you're down on yourself,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">down on yourself, obsessing over like things going on in your life that are bad, and that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">conversation was bad, and I'm bad. And again, there's overlap here, but it's typically fritz</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">out your, the pleasure centers, the ability to have any happiness or optimism gets fritzed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">out by heavy rumination, where deep procrastination was very specifically schoolwork. Again, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">can overlap. If you're depressed, you're not going to do schoolwork. But if you have optimism</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and enjoy things in your life, just can't do the schoolwork, that's deep procrastination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so they're two different things. When it was clearly deep procrastination for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">students, the key was to reduce both of those instigating factors. Extrinsic motivation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">large cognitive toil, it's just physically really demanding the cognitive work you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to do. So this is where I started writing about, at first, the Zen valedictorian philosophy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">on my blog, and then later, the romantic scholar philosophy, which was all about taking your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">college career, moving the locus of control from the extrinsic end of the spectrum back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to the intrinsic, so you take back control of what you're studying and why, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">reducing, changing, and modifying your approach to the schoolwork so it's not nearly as, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">not a toil, so you get rid of that negative affect, the friction of actually doing the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">work, you make your work easier.

Now again, if it's depression,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you need clinical help, there's a whole different way you deal with depression, but if it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">just deep procrastination, that would be my cure for people who had it, it would also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">be my preventative for people who worried about it.

I used to go give talks at colleges back in the day where I had this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">student named Tov and he was my case study.

He had all these majors and activities. He was so stressed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">out.

And how he just came alive once he had breathing room. And so I would say you make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">your life easier. And then once you have more than enough time to handle the work you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">doing, use good time management, use good study techniques.

You don't worry about deep procrastination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that was deep procrastination for students. That was its cause. That was my suggestion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The same thing applies, I think, for the professional world. And again, we differentiate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">between depression and deep procrastination. In the professional world, deep procrastination</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is, hey, I run this company and I just can't do the work. I know this thing is due. I got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to get this report to the client.

Okay, so what do you have to do? You got to solve those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">two problems.

Now you're in control to get rid of the toil. The biggest cause of toil</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-YWmriqfc&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for professional jobs is chronic overload.
