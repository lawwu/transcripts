And, you know, I think part of the security issue is I think people don't realize like how intense state level espionage can be, right? Like, you know, you know, this Israeli company had had software that could just zero click hack any iPhone, right?</p><p>They just put in your number, and then it's just like straight download of everything, right? Like, the United States infiltrated an air gaffed atomic weapons program, right? Wild, you know, like, yeah, you know, the, you know, you know, intelligence agencies have just stockpiles of zero days, you know, when things get really hot, you know, I don't know, maybe we'll send special forces, right?</p><p>To like, you know, get go to the data center or something that's, you know, or, you know, I mean, China does this, they threaten people's families, right? And they're like, look, if you don't cooperate, if you don't give us the Intel, there's a good book, you know, along the lines of the Gulag, you know, the inside the aquarium, which is by a Soviet GRU defector, GRU was like military intelligence, Ilya recommended this book to me, you know, I think reading that, I was just kind of like shocked at how intense sort of state level espionage is.</p><p>The whole book was about like, they go to these European countries, and they try to like get all the technology and recruit all these people to get the technology. I mean, yeah, maybe one anecdote, you know, so when so the spy, you know, this eventual defector, you know, so he's being trained, he goes to the kind of GRU spy academy.</p><p>And so then to graduate from the spy academy, sort of before you're sent abroad, you kind of had to pass a test to show that you can do this. And the test was, you know, you had to in Moscow, recruit a Soviet scientist and recruit them to give you information sort of like you would do in the foreign country.</p><p>But of course, for whomever you recruited, the penalty for giving away sort of secret information was death. And so to graduate from the Soviet spy, this GRU spy academy, you had to condemn a countryman to death. States do this stuff. You know, you've got to have Russia proof security, right?</p><p>It's like you can't you can't just have Russia steal your stuff. And like, maybe their clusters aren't going to be as big, but like, they're still going to be able to make the crazy bioweapons and the you know, the mosquito sized drone swarm, you know, and so on. And so I mean, I think I think I think the security component is just actually a pretty large component of the project in the sense of like, I currently do not see another way where we don't kind of like instantly proliferate this to everybody.</p><p>So like, yeah, how easy would it be for for an actor to steal the things that are like, not the things that are released about Scarlett Johansson's voice, but the the RL things are talking about the unhoblings. I mean, I mean, all extremely easy, right? You know, I, you know, DeepMind, even like, you know, they, they don't make a claim that it's hard, right?</p><p>DeepMind put out there, like whatever, frontier safety, something, and they like layout security levels, and they, you know, security levels zero to four, and four is the zone resistant to state actors, and they say we're at level zero, right? And then, you know, I mean, just recently, there's like an indictment of a guy who just like stole the code, a bunch of like really important AI code and went to China with it.</p><p>And, you know, all he had to do to steal the code was, you know, copy the code and put it into Apple Notes, and then export it as PDF. And that got past their monitoring, right? And, you know, Google is the best security of any of the AI labs, probably because they have the, you know, the Google infrastructure.</p><p>I mean, I think, I don't know, roughly, I would think of this as like, you know, security of a startup, right? And like, what does security of a startup look like, right? You know, it's not that good. It's easy to steal. - Is it just a matter of getting the right pen drive, and you plug it into the gigawatt data center next to the Three Gorges Dam, and then you're off to the races?</p><p>- I mean, look, there's a few different things, right? So one threat model is just stealing the weights themselves. And the weights one is sort of particularly insane, right? Because they can just like steal the literal like end product, right? Just like make a replica of the atomic bomb, and then they're just like ready to go.</p><p>And, you know, I think that one just is, you know, extremely important around the time we have AGI and super intelligence, right? Because it's, you know, China can build a big cluster. By default, we'd have a big lead, right? Because we have the better scientists, but we make the super intelligence, they just steal it, they're off to the races.</p><p>Weights are a little bit less important right now. Because, you know, who cares if they steal the GP4 weights, right? Like, whatever. And so, you know, we still have to get started on weight security now. Because, you know, look, if we think AGI by 27, you know, this stuff is going to take a while.</p><p>And it, you know, it doesn't, you know, it's not just going to be like, oh, we do some access control. It's going to, you know, if you actually want to be resistant to sort of Chinese espionage, you know, it needs to be much more intense. The thing, though, that I think, you know, people aren't paying enough attention to is the secrets, as you say.</p><p>And, you know, I think this is, you know, the compute stuff is sexy. You know, we talk about it. But, you know, I think that, you know, I think people underrate the secrets because they're, you know, I think they're, you know, half an order of magnitude a year just by default sort of algorithmic progress.</p><p>That's huge. You know, if we have a few year lead by default, you know, that's 10, 30 X, 100 X bigger cluster. If we protected them, you know, I don't think anyone has really gotten up in front of these people and been like, look, you know, the thing you're building is the most important thing for like the national security of the United States for like, whether, you know, like, you know, the free world will have another century ahead of it.</p><p>Like, this is the thing you're doing is really important, like for your country, for democracy. And, you know, don't talk about the secrets. And it's not just about, you know, oh, DeepMind or whatever it's about. It's about, you know, these really important things.</p></div></div></body></html>
