I'm not sure if it's of use to anyone, but this is a record of my brief travels to the year 2077 in the cyberpunk universe. I sadly don't have time to play games these days, but they've been a source of a lot of pleasure throughout my life, so life's too short.</p><p>Might as well enjoy it every once in a while. I'll try to do this once or twice a month, but if we're being honest, 2021 is looking quite insane. The next one I wanna try is Stanley Parable, which is the opposite of cyberpunk. It's only like a 15 minute game that you play through several times.</p><p>I think cyberpunk 2077 is supposed to be a game you could play if you do all the side quests. You should be able to play for at least 100 hours. So I'm only gonna do about two, three, maybe four hours today and that's it. I'm gonna walk away. Nobody walks away from a good RPG.</p><p>Well, I'm gonna walk away, friends. It's called discipline. All right, here we go. Oh, and please check out our sponsors in the description, Theragun and Grammarly. So one is for your muscles and the other is for your grammar. The choice is yours, my friends. Choose wisely. Please check them out in the description to get a discount and to support the podcast that I host.</p><p>All right, here we go. New game, Cyberpunk 2077, released just like a couple hours ago. Let's go. Select difficulty level. Most things in life, I will go very hard. For me, normal is probably the equivalent of what very hard is for most gamers. I really haven't played video games in a long, long time.</p><p>All right, normal is enemies will have all the tools at their disposal to take V on. V is the name of the character, I suppose. But primarily only enemies at a higher level will prove a challenge. Easy is the right choice for players who just want to sit back and enjoy the story.</p><p>Combat will not pose a challenge. Ooh, as you get older, you learn to appreciate the story, not the combat. What would David Goggins do? David Goggins probably go very hard and lose within five minutes and then go run. Okay, let's go normal. Nomad, Street Kid, or Corpo. So many decisions.</p><p>Select V's life path. Some events and dialogue options in the game will be different depending on your choice. Nomad is roaming the badlands, looting scrapyards, raiding fuel depots. Life on the road wasn't easy. But growing up in Nomad clan has its perks. Honesty, integrity, and a love of freedom.</p><p>Qualities that few in Night City possess and no amount of money can buy. I like these guys, Nomads. Street Kids, they say if you want to understand the streets, you got to live them. Gangs, fixtures, dolls, small time pushers, you were raised by them all. Down here, the law of the jungle dictates the weak serve the strong.</p><p>The only law in Night City you have yet to break. The weak serve the strong. Think we're gonna need a couple hours to think about that one. Okay, Corpo, corporate. Comes with a marketing team and HR. Few leave the corporate world with their lives. Few are still with their souls intact.</p><p>Amen. You've been there, you've bent the rules, exploited secrets and weaponized information. There's no such thing as a fair game. Only winners and losers. I'm pretty sure Nomad is basically where it's at. I wish you could wear a suit and tie as a Nomad. Let's see if you can dress yourself.</p><p>Let's go Nomad. Oh boy. Select V's body type. V's appearance may sometimes affect the behavior or other characters. Appearance doesn't matter, it's all about the inside. I feel very uncomfortable with the selection. So there's this guy with a shortcut and some red hair. Guys with some scars. Scars are always good, means you've lived.</p><p>This guy's too good looking. Oh, this is random generation. All right, let's just keep generating random ones until we get close to what we're looking for. We want gritty, but not too pretty. (suspenseful music) Disturb the comfortable, nice tattoo. I think the random generation is really off. I think this is actually pretty close to what I'm looking for.</p><p>Voice tone, masculine. Feminine. There's pronouns. I'm gonna go with he/him. Skin type. That's so cool. I love video games so much. You can define so much about the characters. Hairstyles. Oh man, let's go with the basics. I'm a big fan of eyes, so I think eyes truly are the window to the soul.</p><p>So let's see. Oh, it's like, interesting. It's more like the entirety of the structure of the, okay, cool. I like the intensity of the original guy. Eyebrows. Whatever, this is good enough. It's starting to get uncomfortable. Nose, that's good enough. Mouth. Yep. Ears. Can you do cauliflower ears? This guy been in a fight?</p><p>Come on. Give me some, is that a little cauliflower? (soft music) Do we really need 21 ear types? Beard. Beard is fine. Maybe clean shaven? Nah. Cyberware. I don't know. Can you go no cyberware? It's kind of old school with the cyber, yeah, a little subtlety. Yeah, just off, okay.</p><p>Yeah, off on the cyberware. We go old school. We like cyber, but let's keep it off the face. Not the face. Facial scars. Yeah, you gotta have facial scars. Each one of them has a, whoa, that's intense. That's like a tire been driven over him. I like, I like, I like this one.</p><p>It's got a hit in the head with something. Facial tattoos, nah. Piercings, nah. Teeth. Yes, please. Oh, yeah, I'll go with the white ones. Oh, right, yeah. Basic teeth. Eye makeup color. Lip makeup. Cheek makeup. Blemishes. Nails short. Nipples on or off. You can turn off the nipples. Let's keep the nipples.</p><p>Body tattoos. Bodies, no tattoos. Scars, yes. Let's go with the Bruce Lee, the three scratch marks. That's either a cat or overly friendly girlfriend. Genitals, I'll probably edit that part out, but you can actually select the genitals. So like penis or vagina, and then you can select the penis size and the pubic hair style.</p><p>It's kind of fascinating. It's an interesting design choice. But since I'm thinking of uploading this video, I'll keep it family friendly. But in case you're wondering, this character is packing some heat. Customize attributes. Choose the core attributes you want to begin with. Each attribute contains a set of skills.</p><p>Both attributes and skills provide different bonuses depending on your style of play. Skill levels increases you perform activities associated with them. The maximum level of a skill is limited by the level of the attribute that it belongs to. Interesting. Body determines your raw physical power. Okay. Intelligence determines your net running proficiency.</p><p>Every level of intelligence will increase cyber deck RAM capacity, increase quick hack damage, so basically like hacking ability. So computer skills, it's like Napoleon Dynamite, non-check skills. Reflexes determine your maneuverability. Technical ability represents your technical know-how. It allows you to unlock doors and use tech weapons. Cool determines your resilience, composure and effectiveness in operating from stealth.</p><p>So like a stealthy type of thing. So intelligence is like the, that's the mage, the wizard. Body's like the warrior. Reflexes, yeah, that's like agility. Technical ability, that's lock picking. And then cool is like stealth, like lurking in the shadow. Probably, I'd probably go body and intelligence, probably emphasizing intelligence.</p><p>So I gotta be honest with you. I'm not into lock picking or sneaking around. I'm slow, hit hard, but also have reasonably okay programming ability. So probably gonna put everything into body and intelligence. Well, IRL. And since it looks like I can't spend everything on body and intelligence, ain't that the truth, I'll go one in reflexes.</p><p>So begins your story in Night City. Alias V, backstory Nomad, attributes, we know what the attributes are. There's the scan code for the biometric data, let's go. User unknown, patch F, remove patch. Backers. Move with WSAD and look around with the mouse. That mechanic looks like a punk. Maybe I should look in the mirror.</p><p>So how do I actually engage with him? You can cycle through dialogue choices, I guess with the mouse wheel, or up and down, calm down, brother. Okay, so now in square brackets, it says check engine and I can tell him to step aside, I'll handle it. Or I'm going to pay you what we agreed.</p><p>I'm gonna pay you what we agreed. - I'm gonna pay you what we agreed, not one anymore. - Huh, for that you can borrow my tools and fix it yourself. - All right. - That's fine. - Step aside. - Step aside. - What? - You heard me. - You have any idea what I do?</p><p>- I think I'll bypass the coupling. - I'm gonna bypass the coupling and rig a hotwire. - Compressor will run on and on. - Put these on. - I know what I'm doing. Did he ask your opinion? I like this guy. Satan, maids of Satan. So the exclamation points is get in the car.</p><p>So those are the things, those are like quests or instructions, get in, F. Cool, let's go. - Okay, let's see what happens. - Start engine. (engine revving) Love the sound of this car. - It'll get me to Night City. I figure something else out there. - Connect to radio station, yes please.</p><p>- Antenna on this heap don't seem like it packs a punch. Not liable to hear much. - You don't say. - Hey Mike, didn't know you had a customer. - Rolled in a few hours past. I thought he'd at least called in today. - Don't you sweat it, Mike.</p><p>We're gonna hash it out. - I like this town. - Don't you know you owe the sheriff a word when you pay his town a visit? To tell him what's brought you here. - Hey big guy. I'm just passing through. - No need to worry, I won't be staying long.</p><p>- Didn't ask my question now, did you? - I'm here alone. I travel alone. - There is no clan, there is no camp. I'm here alone. - Closed door, I don't want any trouble. I don't think I want any trouble. Not afraid of it, just don't want trouble with this guy.</p><p>He seems like a small fish. - Get it clear, I don't want any trouble. - Then stop looking for it and hit the road. - All right, calm down buddy. Drive out the garage, W. (car engine roaring) Okay. Vehicle steering, A and D, accelerate with W, brake with S, cool.</p><p>And where do I go? Go to the telecom tower, okay, gotcha. (laughing) Such a boomer. Active job objectives are marked with the exclamation on the HUD. Okay, go to the telecom tower. Oh man, video games are so fun. You drunk, let's go home. So bad at this. Sorry, I'm paying attention to a million things.</p><p>I'm not paying attention to the road. Exit vehicle, taxi vehicle, hold F. This game is so beautiful. I wanna go hiking out there. Can we just go, is that a side quest? Just go hiking. Oh, this is nice. It's freezing in Boston right now. This would be nice. Just run up that mountain, you see like David Goggins running along those mountains.</p><p>Look how beautiful that is. That's when you know you're getting old. You don't wanna shoot anything, you just wanna enjoy walking around, looking at the beautiful scenery. All right, F, enter. What do you want from me? Kick it in, you gotta kick it in. Climb the telecom tower and locate the control box.</p><p>Hopefully this is not nauseating to watch. Oh, let's see. How do you, oh, cool. (footsteps) Very rusty with this whole video game thing. Open, oh, that's not the button. I'm also using a Kinesis keyboard, which is really hard to press stuff with. Connect to radio. This is ground control to Major Tom.</p><p>- Come in, come in. - I'm raised to finally. - Willie McCoy, it's good to hear your voice. - Fee, wish I could say the same. - I need your help. - I need your help. - Look at that. - One last time. - Look at that car driving over there.</p><p>- One last time, again? - Yes. - I have to find the client with my payload, but I don't know where he is. - Hmm, right place, right time. You were there? - Of course. - Of course I was. Maybe the client left a message. Could you check for me?</p><p>- Hmm, sure. Last time though, I mean it. Client's name? - Jackie Wells. - Huh, actually left a message. He's waiting on a farm, flicking you the geoloc data. - Cool. - Thanks, Willie, I owe you one. - This is the Keanu Reeves character, I think. - Don't get yourself killed.</p><p>- Don't get yourself killed. - Don't call again. - Wow, that sounds like every time I talk to my parents. I'm terrified of heights, even in a video game, so. This is very stressful. Look at this thing. Definitely not a Tesla. Maybe a Cybertruck. Like a really beat up Cybertruck.</p><p>I love that sound. Head to the meeting place. Wow, what, how old are you that you're driving like this? It's hard with the Kinesis keyboard, that's my excuse. Plus I don't wanna go slowly, I wanna go fast. (car engine revving) So soon. This is Jacques Valjean. All I was doing is driving, sir.</p><p>Okay, police introduction. Any illegal activity such as theft or attacking civilians will result in an NCPD placing a bounty on you. The police will send a patrol to the crime scene and the strength of the response will be proportionate to the size of the bounty to lose. The police move away from the crime scene and lay low for a while.</p><p>So it's kinda like GTA Grand Theft Auto. Sorry, I'm really sorry, I was just driving, sir. They're shooting at me. I should've gone with the easy level. I just wanted to go hiking. This is so bad. It's really sensitive, okay? In meat space, I'm used to the car not being so sensitive to my keyboard.</p><p>I'm gonna head to the meat place. I don't know any of the keyboard shortcuts of how to look behind me. Get out of the car. This is very stressful. F, I'm getting out of the car. You told me to get out of the car. I'm getting out of the car.</p><p>Are you? Oh, you have to hold F, cool. Me, Jackie Wells. All right, Keanu, let's go. Where you at? Okay, I guess this is not the Keanu Reeves character. Are you Jackie Wells? Good man. Let's do a podcast. manners you know let's start with you then why don't we start with you then NC native right here got Haywood in my blood I've never been to NC that doesn't mean much to me so imagine a place where everyone's like your bro or sis or family to cousin at least I think I understand you have to like each other but it's family that's Haywood that and everyone's back in iron it's like the futuristic version of Godfather could Sam from my own Haywood you will be serious we're gonna get along fine what's with the cargo the haircut choice I'm questioning it what's inside don't ask questions let's just load it up loaded in the car oh follow Jackie how much you think this guy can bench calm I got held up and you weren't exactly easy to find probably does I did delay low you know 315 wraps of 10 nice no swear please open the trunk I should have asked what's in there starting to regret these decisions here we go again I'm just gonna go the speed limit this time couldn't get made fun of so much for this driving back in my day we used to play Prince of Persia you had to just exist in a two-dimensional world I was just scrolling from left to right listen friend we're both professionals a week this is such a beautiful game I look at the city in the background sure you've moved contraband before why nervous look at this world it feels like a coronavirus time to deserted the wind is blowing I love this drive to the border hey what are you games are so amazing what now nothing scan us and check our papers the police officers they're always nice to the inspection area I think that was just I got a real bad feeling about this take document hand me the fan I mean the manifest don't need to see it grab these let me see it's marked L away perfect what's that mean lost an arrival it means the cargo is flagged as to be lost as soon as across the border oh they know we're smuggling they're about to find out look at the dog bobblehead you have bribe money customs officer to turn a blind eye to our dubious docu's will need a sweetener do you have the credit chip with the bribe oh oh interesting is it Bitcoin or is it aetherium take money and get out right you forgot welcome to the cool cool deposit weapon at the front desk I don't know if I'm armed place weapon now I know Wow that thing looks good to one of my favorite numbers keep pressing the wrong key happy funny feels wearing a make America great again hat papers is this routine routine it might be we'll see I like the depth of conversation here what are you transporting I don't know in there ah yes remind me you drive for which nomad clan I don't drive for any clan none no clan I drive for myself bold and none too wise you know one man wolfpack someone like you I'm oh so grateful not to be on that side of the table I feel the same way go on your associates waiting for you in the car collect your weapon at the front desk I apologize if I'm moving really slowly here I'm just enjoying this this is super fun for me just walking around I teach you these people a life story probably thank you turn to the car he's driving I guess soon we need to get out of here yeah okay forget that looks like that on first appearance he seems awfully nervous smelling trouble around the bend drive Jackie just drive she nervous but he someone's coming our way sensitive so tough exterior sensitive so immediately let's get out of here on it you are transporting contraband that is corporate property given how bad I was a driving I'm probably even worse at shooting draw weapon is alt can use this keyboard man this is fun to shoot okay yeah actually my friend I hit them or the car I see the car yeah thought I hit him in the head still okay like I guess the game where you hit the person that doesn't kill them very stressful I don't like shooting at the police at this difficult tenth time in 2020 I'm a huge supporter of the police one of the hardest jobs I apologize for shooting at them in this artificially constructed world of 2077 I'm also realizing my mouth cool keep driving can't stop here there's some cool drones in there very interesting place looks deserted I'm gonna stop here nice palms are wet get out of the car let's go that what you call smuggling supposed to go smooth no problems temper calm down things like this happen sometimes these things happen actually I wasn't gonna pay you at all just gonna bust ass and disappear soon as we crossed over but you're alright I appreciate the honesty the honesty thanks but now what's next now we take a peek inside please don't be a body please don't be a body all right let's look shit it says our Osaka on the crate we're robbing some heavy hitters maybe we'll make some heavy money fish on this for real iguana oh let's talk about iguanas yeah I watched a thing on TV about him went extinct like 30 years ago from the lesser Antilles you come a long way pull it up oh that thing looks beautiful sure think it'll make us happy no plans I don't have any plans I spent the last years traveling between states with my nomad family I'll probably be waiting for you somewhere and no we decided to go our separate ways I must be tough huh I have no one to go back to but don't you worry let me help you find digs you gotta live somewhere it's important to have people you can turn to you know like family maybe you'll find your own down in Night City thanks much appreciated hey come on it's nothing you got chemistry you and me be a crying shame to waste it hope this guy's not trying to trick me oh that thing is cute look at that all right let's shake hands okay partner time to grab a man to man chick we're looking for somewhere in this building probably crawling with the pin there was the kidnapper I Japan town half a year later speaking of which got you a little something well the tech training shard in case you need to brush up on your dance moves all right let's do a little tutorial still a shooting practice I guess it is wait where am I plugging that in what where did I just plug that in this is some Neuralink type of text yellow gun not my style well have to do what am I doing shoot all the targets okay okay we crank it up a notch with the next round the targets that's terrible take proceed to crouch and hide behind cover cover can protect you from enemy fire oh headshot does matter got it how do you do that you're injured if your health falls to zero you die use the inhaler to your gain health when you pick up a consumable it will automatically be added to the consumables quick slot in your inventory if empty press X now to use one of the regain okay cool where's the health switching weapons press one two three or four or the switch weapons cool I should also say that I haven't played shooters very much so I'm really terrible shooters okay cool so maybe you mean hacking's the next item on the menu I like this lady hacking cool let's begin training I wonder if she's a robot scanning highlights objects of interest in your surroundings it provides valuable information about them cool hazards are highlighted in red hackable objects are highlighted in green objects useful in other ways are highlighted in blue release tab to exit the scanner cool with a cyberdeck installed your scanner provides an additional interface for selecting quick hacks and their targets use distract enemies to distract the guard navigate the list of available quick hacks with the mouse wheel duration 30 seconds cool down zero seconds upload time 1.4 34 seconds causes a device to malfunction resulting in erratic behavior that will distract nearby people Wow so hacking is a big part of this game that's interesting and intelligence is a part of hacking so I'm glad I invested in intelligence not all about brute force I guess the body helped with the kicking down the door this game is cool probably way too complicated okay sneak up to the guard got it good I got take him out quietly all right all yours take him out kill of course never smart to leave behind this is an alternate reality where murder is supposedly allowed now pick up the body and hide it somewhere pick up the body approach it closely look at it and hold our sometimes a dirty deed must be done you can hide dead and unconscious in certain places doing so will help you avoid detection by other enemies got it up off in the dumpster you go I'm sorry friend but this is just virtual reality now try to take him down in one I want to see what technique he used time to get down and dirty in close-quarter combat tap to perform a fast attack hit the enemy three times with fast attacks got it to perform a fast attack combo press the left mouse button while the previous fast attack is executed hold the left mouse button to charge a strong attack then release it to perform it cool let's go yeah use the techniques you've learned so far to defeat the enemy and here I am using none of the techniques nice the melee combat techniques you've learned can also be used with melee weapons such as a katana okay I can block cool cool very easy oh good stuff looks like you're cruising already she looks proud of me now we can get down to business time to work let's do this this is such a fun escape from the real world unfortunately I probably only got an hour maybe two most I guess there's a lot of pre story to get through here I mean I didn't get much at all into the main quest yes hi what are you looking at and Sandra Dorsett targets by a man with mute a couple hours back suspected abduction Jackie's right calm the hell down okay could at least try to be nice you want nice supportive call a damn helpline okay why can't we all just get along looking for 1237 he's just me yoga working his posture fingers crossed it's not too late thank you I hate this life or death shit I can the door thank you can trip it on your own feet huh they seem like a nice lady I know you're a sweetheart inside that tough exterior need to calm down my man Jackie hack the door to begin hacking look at a device and scan it by holding tab cool open remote deactivation cool hostile area bunch of stuff what's happening that's how I feel like every time I go to the dentist I know but now's I hit I       just be quiet...hey, grab the one closest let's take him sweat the weed until you get some punch all down left meat probably not the last of them anti-chemicants and fabric tank top alright, he'll take everything I'm sorry buddy yeah let's take the guns oh, this thing is...</p><p>(gunshots) don't see any movement on the sensors looks like you got him you're clear to go find Sandra Dorsett what's up Jackie, how you doing brother? we should do a podcast after this oh, there's two of them wow they don't look too friendly let's go yeah, let's go she sounds like a nice lady ah, these cars are badass reminds me of Back to the Future even though this is the future it sure looks like the 80's good music beautiful graphics this is ultra realistic I could tell I could probably spend like a hundred plus hours here just exploring the city there's a mix of LA, there's a mix of Vegas deserted I wanna take a piss come on V get down on the ground hold tight V got you asshole V, aim for the driver shoot him got him this game so far is a lot more shooting than RPG it really gives me the Grand Theft Auto vibes which, you know, it's fun but like I said, I'm much more Elder Scrolls kind of guy I guess this is a good little experiment about what it's like to play games, to comment, and so on what is it that makes me so special?</p><p>a heart of gold cause only somebody with a heart of gold can understand just how much I need to get back to my girl you're... girl? I told you, Jackie's a sweetheart, romantic sure probably cries during Notebook that's a shame let us through please let's see if kindness gets us through she's nice can we just ride with Jackie, listen to Led Zeppelin and not shoot anybody, can we do that?</p><p>so you can be nice, amen I'm always never not nice it's pretty good dialogue, pretty good conversation I like this place, I like this game it's gonna be sad to say goodbye alright nice handshake I'm gonna be nice, amen bye later go home? it's good to be home this is my apartment this is the opposite of what my apartment looks like this is way too nice so I can sleep, check your weapons stash and then go to bed alright where's the computer?</p><p>how are you supposed to do any kind of programming? it's just guns go to bed, let's go to bed it's actually, currently 3am in Boston so it's actually getting about that time, close to bed act 1, ok, maybe I'll do one quest and that'll be it for this game it'll be time to say goodbye the graphics, the characters I can tell I would love this game, it's a beautiful place to visit part of me is actually really enjoying the fact that I can just see people, they're not wearing masks we're in proximity, we can just explore the depth that is each other's weirdness oh man, this feels surprisingly good, just to be among people even if it's in a virtual world these people are awesome oh man, I can't wait till things open back up and you can just meet people and talk to people look at this, look at this city wow wow this is very Grand Theft Auto-ish what's the job exactly?</p><p>system malfunction are these part of the game or is this like the bugs that everyone's talking about? alright, let's do it god, the graphics, even at this level I don't have it on ultra, I have it on high and this is 1080p I think still, so awesome look at it, you can see like the freckles on his face so awesome *laughs* you have to stop for pedestrians oh man I'm so- that's not very nice I'm not very good at any of this, I apologize this car is pretty badass, that I know for sure Victor's Clinic *reads instructions on screen* those are the future versions of neurosurgeons I suppose *reads instructions on screen* this is awesome this is where the surgery happens alright, what's up buddy Neurosocket *reads instructions on screen* ooh, looking to upgrade looking to upgrade, do I want to upgrade?</p><p>*reads instructions on screen* *reads instructions on screen* let's go back to the standing desk alright *reads instructions on screen* I wonder if that's the bugs they were talking about *laughs* so cool, he's gonna upgrade the eyes that is awesome I got Lasik surgery by the way best thing I've ever done alright, let's put it in although I don't really trust a neurosurgeon with rolled up sleeve and the sleeve tattoos *laughs* I wonder if the folks in Eurolink, any of them play this game and what they think this is funny *reads instructions on screen* *reads instructions on screen* let's continue ocular systems operating systems god, imagine this is the future this is what upgrades look like of course, if it in fact costs money then of course the elite people that inherent money will be able to upgrade themselves and thereby increasing the gap between the have and have nots and there'll be a Bernie Sanders type of character who tries to fight that maybe the future looks a lot like the present ocular systems, let's go with ocular systems Kishore Optics, zero dollars cool I just installed some new eyes hands is this free?</p><p>yeah, it's free cool *reads instructions on screen* interesting links the eye or like directly to the weapon wow links the weapon to your eye skipping the entirety of the rest of the mess of human biology cool, I love it alright this is cool, this gives me a little preview of this world if I didn't have a million things going on I'd stay here for a few more hours but nope good to know *reads instructions on screen* let's do it I wonder if they'll show the neurosurgery look how crappy the equipment is oh man, they're gonna show it aren't they that's what Lasik felt like it's like these things are going after your eye but you gotta trust the robotics there, you gotta trust the equipment and it worked out beautifully for me and I think it works out really well for most people *reads instructions on screen* yeah, better than ever *reads instructions on screen* cool, so this like gave me extra ability to scan *reads instructions on screen* ok well this is all stuff I already know *reads instructions on screen* *reads instructions on screen* this is a pretty violent world isn't it I'm not gonna ask what it is *reads instructions on screen* Jackie Wells back to Jackie *reads instructions on screen* hard chockers Regina Jones *reads instructions on screen* cyberpsychosis imagine all the psychological disorders that are side effects of implants let's get in this car let's get the job done oh is that Dex *reads instructions on screen* nice hand *reads instructions on screen* this guy's a philosopher how they remember you, that's all that counts cigar not at all, let's get it done *reads instructions on screen* got a beef this shard thing I wish it had a little bit more science about it protein processing plant Alpha Fold 7 *reads instructions on screen* I say when, cause Brick was the leader three days after we'd sealed our deal his friend and gang mate once Simon Randall, aka Royce plain dropped his ass Royce is in charge now and I got no way of knowing if he aims to honor his predecessors word the ad of the shitstroom one Meredith Stout of Militech has developed an interest in said convoy I think I got everything time I got to work *reads instructions on screen* that's a friendly fella blaze of glory I like that guy, I like the characters this game creates I'm not so much for the shooting and the Grand Theft Auto style quests but I like I like the city I like the people *reads instructions on screen* oh my god, I love this world let's visit Maelstrom we'll take care of that situation and then call it a wraps as I'm playing this now, I'm realizing how much I've changed relative to my ability to appreciate a Grand Theft Auto style game not loving it let's meet him let's meet him *reads instructions on screen* he paid up front?</p><p>*reads instructions on screen* well, whatever let's go get this tech don't know you wanna talk to Royce *reads instructions on screen* lots of books just laying around alright let's meet this fella *reads instructions on screen* *reads instructions on screen* this is gonna be a lot of combat I like these couches they got character reminds me of True Romance that scene with Drexel I'll stand Jack, sit down this ain't gonna end well I'll pass yeah, you gotta wonder with all that neurotech what kind of drugs they do what is with this guy?</p><p>watch, this is like a spot what's the dynamic spot robot? oh, it's a robot dog in it this is awesome where am I supposed to look? we'll take it there's a lot of swearing in this game *reads instructions on screen* uh oh this is not gonna end well *reads instructions on screen* ah boy let's shoot him gotta grab the robot almost forgot got the set, bot and controller let's go, the quicker the better alright looking at the time I gotta escape this place I'm sure that would be very much fun but uh I gotta get back to work I got about an hour more before I head to bed this was really fun to escape but mostly it was fun to just play games again I would say this is kind of like a Grand Theft Auto with an RPG flavor to it I think a lot of people would really enjoy this game it's not really my thing I'd love to explore this world in a different kind of context this is a little bit too much shooting for my tastes if I'm gonna do shooting I'd rather do just a straight up shoot, like I like Call of Duty, all that kind of stuff this was a cool game, but I'm gonna walk away with a smile and uh some good memories sadly I didn't get to meet Gano Rizzo's character, but uh life is full of disappointments as David Goggins said recently on his Instagram, when life gives you lemons, just eat the mother effing lemons so I hope there wasn't too much swearing or nudity in this game, that was kind of a shock to me a little bit definitely haven't played a game like it before maybe like Duke Nukem was the last game that had that kind of flavor to it anyway this is uh a first time I played a video game in quite a long time and definitely obviously the first time I've ever recorded myself playing a video game so this is just a one giant experiment let me know what you think, if it's of interest to anyone I'll play another video game maybe close to New Year's and try to do it once a month but like I said, 2021 is gonna be a hell of a crazy year this was a lot of fun if you have time on your hands you should definitely play this game if not then you should get your butt back to work and again thanks to our two sponsors Theragun and Grammarly like I said, one's for the muscles one's for your grammar pick the one you want to work on most or do both and check them out in the description to get a discount and to support the podcast I host hope this was at all enjoyable let me know what other games you'd like to see me play in the distant future and I encourage all of you to play this or other video games if it's a source of joy life's too short not to do all these kinds of fun little detours love you all, happy holidays</p></div></div></body></html>
