It's like a personal fork in the road. Yeah. So I said, I am going to align my life. And then after that prayer, I was like, I don't want to open this Bible. What would you say to our church about Vietnam?</p><p>Vietnam is kind of at the brink of some sort of spiritual revival. All right, hello. Welcome to the official, unofficial Acts 2 Network podcast. Welcome. Where we are launching lifelong kingdom workers from every college town. My name is Stephen. I'm Isaiah. And today we have Pastor Daniel and Sarah.</p><p>Thank you guys for coming on. Yeah. We want to talk to you guys a lot about foreign missions. You guys recently came back from leading one of our teams to visit our foreign mission teams there and provide some support and help and that sort of thing. But before we do, why don't you guys just introduce yourselves a little bit?</p><p>What's your current role in our network? Yeah. What year did you graduate? Who's your peers, I guess? And yeah, that sort of thing. Yeah, I'm Daniel and I guess I'm a director. I mean, I now live in SoCal in LA, West LA. So I oversee a lot of the SoCal churches, inner SoCal, mostly inner SoCal, like UCLA, USC, those campus ministries.</p><p>I mean, there's leaders there already, but then where I'm just kind of like hanging out. That's a bug. It's like, what's going on here? Someone's got to do it. Yeah, somebody's got to do that. Somebody's got to look in. Hey, hey, how's it going? What is the director? So I graduated in 1995.</p><p>Okay. 1995 as an electrical engineering, computer science major. I think I was the first one in our church. Really? Yeah. No, I'm sure there were others before you. What? Who? Name one. I mean, they're not here anymore. I don't think they were all either doctors or lawyers. I was the first nerd.</p><p>I'm very proud of it. Yeah. Yeah, that might be, huh? What did Peter talk about? No, Mackey. Oh, Mackey. Yeah, Mackey. Oh, yeah. All right, yeah. Okay, I'm Sarah. I graduated in 1994. I was an English major, and then I went to law school, and now I'm directing SoCal.</p><p>SoCal churches. Hovering next to Pastor Daniel. Cool, cool. So, you know, I think sometimes we think of directors, like, whoa, we're like, you're the directors. You must have, I don't know, grown up on Director Island and fallen off a director tree or something like that. But you guys were college students back in 95, so 91.</p><p>That was when we were one years old. Yeah. Some of the people listening to this podcast weren't before yet. Yeah, so how did it all begin? Like, when did you first come to our church as college students? Yeah, as you become Christian, that sort of, yeah. Yeah. Well, I became a Christian before our church.</p><p>I was a sophomore in high school. I became a Christian, and I was looking for, actually, a church that would disciple me. I came, but then I was actually a kind of a lone ranger. I, yeah, I experienced some pretty extreme hypocrisy in the old church that I was attending.</p><p>I mean, I'm talking, like, pretty, like, during the church congregational meeting, we had to call the police because the elders started to get into fistfights. You know what I'm saying? It's like, it was that kind of a situation. Someone else today also said that. Oh, really? It's a Korean thing.</p><p>Yeah, yeah. Taekwondo, you know. That's what happens. So, I was like, oh, church is a failed institution. So, then I just kind of came in with that kind of baggage and saying, oh, church is not really necessary. But I did go to church, you know, with our church, and then I would go back every other weekend to the San Jose church that I came from.</p><p>So, I just go back. You wanted intense establishment, but you're also, like, lone ranger. Yeah. kind of thing. Yeah. Just help me along my path. Kind of, that's what church was for. I thought the church was for that. How lone ranger were you? Like, what do you, like? Yeah, I would, like, I went.</p><p>Nobody knew who he was. Did you know who he was? I didn't know. I didn't know who he was. Yeah. So, you came on, like, Sundays, I guess. I came on Sundays. Sometimes. And Fridays. I did come on Friday. I just took off. But only, like, sporadically, because you went to the other church.</p><p>So, I would do that. And I went on two lone ranger mission trips to China, actually. Wow. By myself. And I got dropped off at a, you know, at a village. And then, well, I thought that the missionary that I was, like, I had contact with would be with me.</p><p>But he just dropped me off. Yeah. He just dropped me off because I'll see you in a week. And I'm like, okay. But then, I thought it was really cool. And it was, like, so, then I taught some people over there. Actually, it was right above North Korea. So, they spoke North Korean.</p><p>I mean, Korean. Yeah. So, I was able to communicate. Okay. So, then, after that, it was actually, that mission trip had good and bad. I was really touched. And I felt like this was what life is meant for. But at the same time, like, my lone rangerism just grew more and more deeply entrenched.</p><p>It's like I could do it myself. Yeah. Wow. So. Oh, so, for me, I came into college wanting to run away from church. I grew up going to church all my life. But I met some guys who were doing Bible study with Pastor Ed, Isaac's dad. He was, like, our class baby, actually.</p><p>He was a one-year-old. You were their class baby. Yeah, he was. I have no memory of that. Really? Yeah. And then, they changed a lot. And they were so excited about the Bible. So, when I started getting spiritually hungry, I wanted to go where they were going. And so, I started coming and became a Christian at the end of my junior year.</p><p>and that's about the same time I noticed him because he suddenly appeared in this church production. And he was really funny. Christian festival. That's when I started to finally come regularly. I didn't notice him, notice him. I just, like, recognized that, oh, there's that guy. Who's that guy? What role were you in?</p><p>I played the role of, like, the, this Asian, It was very, un-PC. Very un-PC. But I was just, I was a doctor, I was, like, a person. A Chinese, um, like, yeah. Heavy Chinese accent. Three days! I was basically a resurrection on trial. It was, like, an apologetics about resurrection of Jesus.</p><p>And I had the, I had this, yeah. The role where it's, like, three days, too long. Three hours, maybe. Oh, that's, three minutes, maybe. And we had no Chinese people back then, so that was offensive. My question is, why make it a Chinese? Because he was supposed to be, like, a lab, like a lab.</p><p>Yeah, like, scientists. Scientists are Chinese. Well, it was supposed to be Korean, I guess, but I just made it into Chinese. So that's just, that's just how it worked. Got it. Different, different era. Yeah. Yeah, we've come a long way. that was too much. Yeah. Wow. All right. So what made you guys want to stay in our church and continue to do ministry?</p><p>I mean, you've done it for now 30-something years. For me, I think it was a huge repentance that happened in the senior year. My perception of Christian, Christian life was a lone ranger, a lone path, journey towards spiritual maturity and church was supposed to sort of be the stepping stone that I step on different churches to kind of go along the way.</p><p>And I guess that was a question that kind of arose to me around that time. It was like, hey, regardless of what church, we're not talking about which church, but would I, would I commit to any church in the future? Would I commit to any church? and I kind of knew that the right answer is yes?</p><p>Like some church, I should commit to some church. But I didn't really know, like I was like, I don't think I would. So then that really started to kind of bother me. And I remember just struggling about that for a long, long time, for about a month, actually. about a month, I was just kind of struggling with it in a pretty intense way because I wanted an answer to what place does a church hold in a Christian life?</p><p>That's interesting. You had such a strong sense that like it should, but then I wouldn't. So like, why is that? Yeah. It's really interesting. Well, I guess maybe I didn't even know if that was the right answer. I just had an inkling that it might be the right answer.</p><p>So I wanted to find, I wanted to kind of, yeah, search the scriptures or something like that. But then I knew that I could pick and choose any verse to justify a Lone Ranger Christian life versus like a Christian life as it is supposed to be a community kind of life.</p><p>So then I just went back and forth on this. And then one day I just, well, my small group leader said, hey, let's go to our entire small group decided to go to a reading retreat to this scary Catholic place called the Mercy Center where like the paintings like look at you in dark hallways.</p><p>Yeah, so it's like that. But then it was like reading retreat back then was a really a reading retreat because, you know, this is remember, this is before like cell phones or smartphones or anything like that. And each of us was, we got one room and we got into this room and it was just a bed and a desk and no internet, no TV, no nothing.</p><p>Oh, you slept there? Yeah, we slept there. It was a three, two nights, three day retreat. Reading retreat. Reading retreat. And then we just, he said, okay, we're all going to our rooms, we'll meet for lunch, we'll meet for dinner and then we hang out a little bit and boom, and the next day.</p><p>So I said, okay, I'm going to read, I'm going to read the epistles. So that, that period, that reading retreat really changed my life because I remember before opening the Bible, I said, God, I have this question about Christian life and I am going, whatever I find in these pages, I am committing right now to align my entire future to that.</p><p>It was like a personal fork of the road. Yeah. So I said, I am going to align my life and then after that prayer, I was like, I don't want to open this Bible because I was like scared. what did I just say? I was like, oh my gosh, this is going to change my life if I actually live accordingly.</p><p>So, so then that was, yeah, the start of it. But then, yeah, it got to a point where by the third day I was like, every page I was crying, repenting, praying, turning the page, crying, repenting, praying about like my understanding of Christian life being so, so long-anger. Yeah, against the Bible.</p><p>Wow. Maybe that's what our retreat should be. Yeah. Kind of like sin. lock you in a room and lock you in a room. How do we teach people to do DT? Before you open that Bible, just commit to live whatever you're going to. Yeah, what you'll find in these pages.</p><p>That's powerful. That's very powerful. We've got to bring some of that back. All right. Well, I don't know, you don't have to have as dramatic a story. Yeah, I just became a Christian and I think the mission trip right after that, my summer after junior year was pivotal to experiencing ministry and Christian life together Was it Japan?</p><p>We went to Japan and Korea so it was a month long and we were together 24-7 and we did a lot of Bible study on Luke and I just remember feeling like this is what I was meant, my life was meant for. I feel so joyful even though I don't have my private space.</p><p>I'm wearing the same thing everybody's wearing and just doing the same thing everyone's doing but yet I feel so much more joy so I just wanted to do that for the rest of my life. Yeah, yeah. And I think that was one of the things that stood out to me when I came to our church too was like, oh, it's just like a mission trip 24-7.</p><p>Wow, that's cool! and I think that kind of explains a lot about who we are and what we do so, yeah. Wow. 24-7 mission trips I mean, not that intense but trying to live that way even at home. Yeah, yeah. Well, speaking of mission trips maybe we can just talk about that.</p><p>Sure. Or maybe before we talk about that we can talk about so how did you guys meet because junior year you notice him but you're like, who's that guy? So how did you guys like, how did you start dating? Like, what's the story about that? She liked me first.</p><p>Yeah. Is that true? Yeah. We have to figure it out kind of later. Like, we have to sort of Yeah. I didn't tell anybody but we had been serving in the same staff group for there was just one staff group and we served there for a few years and then actually a lot of my peers got married so there weren't that many options but I heard I heard you hung up on well, yeah, I called her but you did ask her first?</p><p>I did ask her yeah, okay yeah yeah yeah so then I was like okay, I'm interested I'm interested so I called her were you nervous? I was nervous wow and I was like okay, okay so then I'm hello hello and then small talk some small talk first how are you doing because you know this it's a phone it's a landline call so I'm like hey I was wondering if you wanted to go out with me and it was like a very important like nerve-working question and then her answer was I guess I was really nervous because it's a landline so I'm in my apartment like hoping nobody's overhearing and then also I was excited but I didn't want to seem so excited so then what came out was I guess so I was like I guess and then she goes I meant yes right but then I was like you know what why don't you think about it and just call me back when you're sure so that's I tell single guys don't grovel don't grovel wow was that like how did you feel about that?</p><p>oh shoot no I can't call him right back so now I have to wait and meanwhile I'm like how come she's not calling what's going on here? oh my gosh how long did you wait? at least a day because yeah I couldn't call him back on the same day that's too much that's too much how did that work with landlines back then?</p><p>you just had to hope that the person you were trying to call and you know roommates would you know pick up another landline and then start listening oh that's wrong okay there we go that's wrong yeah that's wrong different times yeah that was very common you guys have any like fun funny dating stories I know the one about the was it the lemon or the lobster?</p><p>oh yeah the lemon and the lobster both of them that was the lobster that was the anniversary oh anniversary oh anniversary you was dating lemon yeah so this is the first day that I'm meeting Sarah's parents and she told me that her dad is a giant like really really tall but he wasn't the rest of the family is my height and my dad so she just remembers looking up tall for his generation yeah but you're like 5'10 right?</p><p>I'm 5'11 your dad was like 5'9 so then anyway we're meeting at this seafood restaurant yeah and I'm nervous and I'm like trying to make a good impression and shake his hand and we sit down across from each other and then we're making small talk and then food comes out it's fish flat it's like a fish you know seafood so then Sarah grabs a lemon I'm talking like this and she's next to me and she's you know how you're supposed to do this you're supposed to like cover it and do this and she goes like that and the lemon juice flies I was wearing glasses too it went right into my right eye like right perfectly into my right eye and I was like like this and I try to I was like trying to play it off for a moment I was trying to play it off but then my right eye was twitching and I started crying on my right eye right so I was like okay I could try to play it off and look really weird or I just I just decided to go for it I was like ow I just went ow Sarah you squeezed lemon into my eyeball I made it very clear to both of them what just happened so they would know what's going on so like me twitching makes sense you know and then you know Sarah's mom was like oh Sarah be careful you gotta be careful that was nice that was after you were married no that was when we were first meeting parents oh so lemon and lobster are not the same lobster was some lobster yeah I never had the lobster one lobster one was like our anniversary and then we went to Spanger's you know seafood and then it was like a Monday I think and it was a lobster special basically I said I've never had lobster before so he said oh you should try it and so it came out I didn't know how to eat it it was pretty cheap so then I was like oh that's a good one that's special let's get it whole lobster and you know they had that lobster that what is that crack cracker thing yeah cracking the wrench the claw the claw so then you know the claw looks like this has a little claw and then you know you're supposed to turn the lobster cracker or the claw crack it crack it this way but she grabs it like this which already has a perfectly shaped just fit perfectly into that space and she's squeezing like this just adding pressure just consistent pressure on that claw and I'm like looking at this I'm like oh and I was about to tell Sarah and then it popped and the whole claw exploded and it went on my glasses and it hit the person behind the table it went to several tables the big piece went and hit this gentleman's back on his head and it was a whole like a group of men right yeah a group of like older men and it went and then and then he just turned back and by this time Sarah was under the table she was hiding she was like oh my gosh and I turned back toward that gentleman with a piece of lobster on my glasses and I said I'm so sorry and he looked at me and I think he kind of knew what's going on and he was like it's alright so that was our just food yeah food food things unfortunately most dates involve food that's unfortunate that's unfortunate wow well that was fun that was fun alright so changing gears a little bit we've changed gears here you guys recently came back from Vietnam and we had multiple international like mission trips going on you guys led how many people were on the there were 30 including us yeah to go support our team there and so we just wanted to just ask you a few questions about that let's just start off on the topic of food what's the best thing you eat there there were the Vietnamese food ban seo it's like a Vietnamese crepe that you wrap in lettuce yeah I mean they were really good Vietnamese food of course but what I was impressed mostly by was actually ban mi ban mi really they're ban mi especially they even got to share because I liked it so much this is ban mi op la which is the egg it's the cheapest ban mi you can get which is just egg egg ban mi how much does it cost a dollar wow so then everything's so cheap when I ate it because I just wanted to see I wanted to get to get the cheapest thing yeah ban mi op la and when I bit in I'm like oh my gosh this is this is what ban mi is supposed to taste like really it's that different huh yeah I thought that was like bread of life shirt no it's ban mi ban mi shirt it's not a bread of life ban mi op la especially I like op yeah anyway wow wow what made it so good like what was the the radishes you know how it's like kind of very vinegary yeah I don't like those it's like slightly vinegary it's more subtle and the bread is softer it's crispy on the outside softer on the inside and then the egg it's like it's kind of runny yeah and that's what just the vinegar and the egg mixture it means people are very proud of their food and they do know how to flavor their food yeah I could see that being good I'm not a fan of I mean America but maybe yeah because then like the bread's so hard it feels like it's not hard at all but wow wow all right well yeah you guys are there leading the team and helping helping our team there I guess one thing we wanted to ask was just you know a lot of us have been praying for our teams and stuff like that and we try to think about like what's what's hard for them what's challenging to try and pray but what's one thing that like you're like I know that was hard but after I personally experienced it oh I can I appreciate the challenge maybe in different ways like a challenge of like foreign mission life I guess does that make sense okay like just during that trip yeah that we observed for the team yeah I think the hardest thing is the language barrier and not being able to understand or speak the language and so but because of that you really are forced to communicate the essentials you know so I think like if you know in trying to share your testimony or your story or the gospel you have to like boil it down so like I guess that's the part that you kind of appreciate since you're like kind of handicapped in that way okay and Vietnamese language is like impossible it's so hard but there is actually one of the sisters that went and actually her Vietnamese got advanced to a point where at least vocab her vocab level was actually you know as a non-Vietnamese person yeah it was really high so is our team like able to converse in Vietnamese or not quite yet yeah it depends on the person yeah it's it's hard it's hard yeah so they kind of especially like gospel conversation or meaningful conversation it's just they can't do that it's really hard so I imagine like most of what they're trying to do then is the English yeah but they have they can't speak Vietnamese enough to get by and kind of get around and things like that yeah so yeah I think that's I think that's true the heat and everything like that it's actually it's pretty surprising I heard crossing the street oh yeah that's scary crossing the street crossing the street that's the most that's the biggest culture shock in Vietnam yeah in Ho Chi Minh City well it's like no they do but there's oncoming traffic like coming straight at you and you just you just have to go straight you don't no not frog you don't stop you never stop oh you have to maintain you have to maintain a constant because they'll just go around you and you trust that they'll go around you yeah wow it's like fish they do fish don't stop you know there's big fish which is the trucks and the cars and the small fishes are motos and everybody's just flowing and we just we just flow that sounds really efficient it's like Indiana Jones it is efficient it's amazing it's efficient but really scary because like I'm looking at a situation I'm going how is this not a gridlock in America it would be like a three hour gridlock but they just they keep moving wow so that was cool what was some of the what are some of the neatest things you guys got to try while you were there and then help the team with like ministry wise ministry wise oh boy it's like well we got to do some pretty awesome things well there's you want to talk about the youth event that was probably the neatest thing that we got to put on basically like a production X2 Live production gospel skit songs and testimonies with youth is that the first time X2 Live went international kind of I think we did something like that in Taiwan maybe oh yeah I think so but like in Vietnam with youth who speak English so they did the whole thing in English with like Vietnamese subtitles and just seeing the youth's passion and desire to share the gospel was really neat they invited their friends and family people also they like listened to all of our direction and they were willing to act you know even though it's not even in their language how do we know these youth yeah we know we have a connection through someone to a like a bunch of schools that are English speaking schools but not Christian schools they are they're private schools but yeah they're private schools or learning centers and it's all in English like when you're there you have to speak English so they all they're native Vietnamese but they learn English and so some of them speak really well like almost like an American and some of them are not so well but they all they all try and they were in need of like a youth group kind of thing yeah so then our team has started doing monthly youth events and then one of their events was dare to share and after that they decided oh since we can't go out yeah they can't actually do go out and share because we'll do this instead and then they invite their friends into a theater and they will share the gospel so it was precipitated by dare to share yeah that's really neat that's where the idea that they got the idea and these youth kids I mean it seems like most of them don't come from Christian backgrounds or do they what's kind of the breakdown there I would I don't I'm not sure but I know that for many of them like their parents and their extended family that they're inviting they're not Christians yeah and they some of them their parents didn't know that their children had turned Christian but they knew through the school or through the camp yeah so then it was their like kind of they had to kind of shore up their courage to go okay I might get a talking to after this but here I'm going to proclaim the gospel to my parents yeah how does that do we have any word about how that's been because I remember hearing about that that like yeah this is they're taking this step but was there any fallout or like I haven't heard any fallout yet I haven't heard about fallout yeah seems like they're still excited okay so far okay that's good news because you just have to see your kid in a play yeah I guess so yeah so it was really neat that happened and then there was also a lot of college campus outreach that was kind of neat so we instead of like doing DC outreach which is what people have been trying yeah decided okay since there's a whole group of people coming let's try just walking through the front door and going to the administrators and go hey we have a bunch of people coming so we're gonna we're gonna do a cultural exchange and and it's all in English so we told them we're not gonna provide even Vietnamese like translations it's all English so then the school getting excited about a bunch of people doing workshops like about college life yeah from America they got together and they kind of filtered out for us and filtered and got together the best English speakers and said hey here we are and like there's 70 of us wow so they were super supportive wow they were very supportive so wow in a communist country that's great that's awesome how are like the what are Vietnamese college students like like what are similarities and differences from American college ministry that you saw well when I described the American college students kind of busy schedule and clubs and things like that they the college students there resonated with that a lot they said oh it's just like that for us here you know Vietnam is developing really fast and so there I think there is that competitive environment and some people like when we invited people over for open homes some of the especially girls would say oh I'm really stressed I'm drowning right now you know with school tests and one big difference is the schedule you want to talk about the schedule it's very different well that and the way the classes get cancelled oh yeah I mean the professors just cancel they have a lot of authority well the professors just decide to cancel for no apparent reason sometimes I just don't feel like teaching and they will reschedule it like to Saturday morning or Friday night oh what the and you have to show up yeah wow so then they were like oh yeah I can't because my professors just rescheduled my class to Saturday and I that would not fly in the stage so that's very different wow I wonder why they're stressed yeah that is stressful that makes me thankful from my college experience I was just gonna do that yeah so it's their schedule is unpredictable in a way well but the similarities well they're very warm we found the students very warm and really open to talking about ideas I think there's just generally a hospitality culture that's kind of built in so then for example like when we were at the cafeteria school cafeteria and we can't read we don't know what to order pretty much every person that we sort of flagged down to help us would stick with us it's not just like oh I'm busy or here it is and they would go okay I'll order for you and they would just stick with us for like sometimes the first girl that I met bought me a drink yeah she was really nice and ate with us wow so they're very warm yeah and is that like a college student specific or is it just Vietnam in general they're like hospital I don't know well one guy said you know in Vietnam you know I talked to you once I talked to you twice twice I'm best friend so I'm like oh that's great yeah but I mean in terms of like how college students are open to ideas and thinking about their future they're like that I feel like they're actually more open more open than typical American college students yeah and they spent a lot of time with us if they came to our events they would talk for a long time wow I mean it's probably a really special opportunity for them too to talk with Americans yeah so yeah what were some of the like bright spots from some of those things you guys did like highlights yeah highlights stories yeah I mean well the celebration of the youth after their event like just seeing them so joyful like these guys were like hugging each other on stage for a long time and taking pictures and then hearing stories about how they some of them used to be so dark but through the youth groups they've been frightening up so much one of the one of the people that were the partners that we're working with she was like tearing up and crying because she goes that person that he was so dark it was so and there have been I mean they've been telling us that there's been like increase in youth suicides just just the darkness of the youth what they're going through and especially the high pressure as money is now becoming a real thing like oh wow you can make it big everybody's trying to shoot for money and there's a lot of pressure for youth to do well in school and all that so so then so then when they saw that and they said this like I can't believe how bright they are look how you know happy they are yeah and they did they actually part of the performance was the one one word description of before and after Christ before Christ and they flipped it and oh man that was powerful yeah so they kind of described it too and shared man yeah that's kind of the like any time a country's like ascending there's always that darker edge to it yeah wow we're glad our team is there yeah so what do you guys think about I don't know future of Christianity in Vietnam and I guess maybe also like I mean every every group you know every missions group is going to bring something like slightly different to the table like is there any way in which you feel like our church has like a particular angle that we can I don't know offer the people of Vietnam or kind of as a church like what yeah any thoughts on that did like the mission team have any thoughts well I think and I think the mission team also thinks that Vietnam is kind of at the brink of some sort of spiritual revival I think it's kind of they're sort of primed for it in a way just the openness to foreign ideas even as they experience some of the investment foreign investments coming in they're like not enforcing this whole like we're a communist country and we're not gonna allow foreign ideas to come in they're just kind of open so there's that and I don't know maybe this is anecdotal but I've seen a lot of even Vietnamese American churches go through a revival in the Bay Area maybe maybe that's just kind of anecdotal to Bay Area but like if you look at the thriving church youth groups even like it's often Vietnamese American churches so I don't know there's something happening with the Vietnamese peoples yeah so I feel really hopeful about that that God might be doing something in the people not only in the country of Vietnam but the people group of Vietnam to somehow make them open for the gospel so yeah and maybe it's not unique to Vietnam but I think people there are still interested in learning English and in the ideas that we you know can exchange with each other and so I think that's something that sort of that makes the country open to the gospel when you say open is it like they're like oh I've never heard this before this is kind of interesting or is it more like oh I've been thinking about this and finally I've got to kind of talk to someone about it I think it's both it's both we've heard both types of responses people are going this is what I've been wanting to talk about this is my first time that I'm talking about it though I've been thinking about this for a long time you know things like that I guess because you shared with me earlier about the dust particles song there's something about that so apparently it's a folk song yeah apparently like every you can explain so one of the playbooks that we play on foreign mission trips that I've done before at Taiwan also is we show the race of a lifetime skit and then there's an Ecclesiastes passage but then I also pick a traditional song from that country that actually everybody knows that expresses the same feeling of vanity of chasing after the wind there's always something so then and then so then I picked I found one and then I checked it everybody knows it was oh yeah everybody knows that one and then it's called that's called dust particles I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right why is it called dust particles it's about dust to dust if dust I go back to dust then the whole chase is exhausting very biblical huh yeah so then everybody knew that so then I kind of quoted it sort of like modeling after when Apostle Paul kind of quoted a poet so then we talk about you know I have the American culture you have a Vietnamese culture but really what we share is a human culture a human condition wow and then so that's the launching path to a discussion and then they're like this is I've been thinking about this why am I doing this why you know so yeah those I think people say that as well as like this is new yeah wow well I think it's pretty amazing just like you know we set up these teams and just being able to hear all the updates from you know just different emails and stuff like that and then some of my own team people went on the mission trip you know and they brought back stories and stuff so it's really exciting to see what God has in store you know yeah and it just seems like we came at a good time yeah so really thankful and I think I feel like more motivated to pray and have a better idea of how to pray so yeah is there anything else you want to know what would you say to our church about Vietnam like what's your what's your rallying cry do we need to send more people Vietnam gotta go I mean I think it is this is the time we don't know how long this window will last in a way this yeah they're very open and we can do stuff actually it's not that's the surprising thing it's freer than we thought it's a lot freer than we thought I mean I know that Hanoi we have to be careful still like the northern area but in the southern area it's kind of it's fine so all right well thank you guys so much yeah thank you so much for being on our show on the podcast not our show but like and subscribe and see you guys next episode thank you guys - Thank
