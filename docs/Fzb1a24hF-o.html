We're trying to sort out some internet options here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=19" target="_blank">00:00:19.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but in the meantime, I'll give us our little intro. So first of all, I'm Kyle, this is Jeremy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we're from Dagger, and you'll see more about what Dagger is through this workshop where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=31" target="_blank">00:00:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to build a cool suite agent, and we're actually going to deploy it to GitHub,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and so even like worst case scenario, if we can't get things running locally when we actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">push things to GitHub and see agents running GitHub, then that's going to be out of our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">internet hands, and it's all going to be really cool. So first of all, on the left side here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we have kind of where we're getting started from. So this is the documentation site where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">we have install instructions, so I'll walk through those real quick. And then our quick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.020</a></span> | <span class="t">starts where we're actually going to walk through these as like the content of this workshop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And then also a shout out to tomorrow night, we have a hack night at the CloudFlare office. It's on the external events list for this conference as well. But here's a QR code for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So real quick. So there's a question about whether there's a Slack, I think? Slack for the workshop? Yes, absolutely. So if you go to the Slack, there's it says dagger dash workshop, ship agents, the ship, got it? Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me pull that up as well. So if there's questions, put them in there or raise your hand and Jeremy will get to you. Climb over people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I will. I will. I will. Yeah. Make it happen. Yes. I'll do my best. Awesome. So yeah, if everyone, if you're following along, awesome. If you can't like because you don't have desk room or can't get the internet or whatever, I'm going to walk through it live because I already have everything on my machine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can always, you know, check back with this later on once you have a solid connection. So if you're not able to get out your computer or follow along, just watch me and I'll go through it and it's gonna be really neat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you are following along, here's the installation page on docs.dagger.io. So you can install from the homebrew tab or straight from our install scripts or with Winget.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You can install the Dagger CLI. The only other dependency is that you need a container runtime such as Docker or Podman or Nerd CTL. So like anything that can run containers because Dagger itself runs its engine as a container.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll explain what that means in a second. But if you're following along, get started on this while I talk through a bunch of stuff about what we're actually doing and what all these technologies are trying to accomplish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think I'll pause you really quick. Yeah, just for the for the folks on the tech team. And so for some of you in the room, we're having we're finding the Wi Fi may or may not work for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Use a hotspot if you got one if that works down in the basement. You're then you're amazing. Also, I'm trying to do a little something through the wired connection here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But for the tech team, it's requiring a password for me to use this service. So anyway, if you have that, slip me a note at some point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But otherwise, yeah, we're working on we're working on getting more connectivity as we speak.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Awesome. Yep, there we go. So the QR is actually for the the hack night tomorrow night, the the docs and what we're going through our docs.dagger.io.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's like the main content for what we're going to walk through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And I guess real quick, we can intro as well if you want to intro yourself first, Jeremy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, sure. I'm Jeremy Adams. I look after the ecosystem. I'm part of the ecosystem team that Kyle and I are both on and been at Dagger for a few years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I've got to see already a progression of folks using us for all sorts of things and most recently a lot around AI agent kind of workflows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But I love in this workshop, we're going to blend together some of the classic use cases we've seen with Dagger around CI and dev workflows as well as, you know, giving those to agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Awesome. Yeah, I'm Kyle. I'm on the same team. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And I have a background in like DevOps and platform engineering, so much more on the kind of cloud infra side of things versus that building side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's cool to come at this from that perspective of, you know, trying to deploy agents somewhere and make things work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why in this workshop, we're going to deploy things to GitHub because that's eventually what you're going to want to do when you build an agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And you have to put it somewhere to run it. I can't just live on your machine all the time, I guess, depending on what agent is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway, so if you made it this far, you've made it to the docs, then we're going to talk a bit about what Dagger is and why we're building agents with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so basically Dagger is, like I said, it's a container runtime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a workflow engine. And so people have historically done things like build their CI/CD with Dagger because you're building these pipelines that orchestrate containers, run all these tasks, and it runs the same on your machine as it runs in any cloud, like in, you know, in your Kubernetes, in GitHub, wherever your CI might run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But it runs the same everywhere. So you're making these workflows. And the cool thing is, that's also what agents are, right, is that they're just these processes where we have a bunch of tools we want to give to an agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway, okay, we're gonna see an action. And so, let's see, we have components, right? So Dagger itself is made up of core components like containers, like I said, also repos, directories, files, and now LMs are also a component that you have to work with, within this kind of toolbox of Dagger and how we're building things. And so it's just another building block, right? It's not a framework special, like, just built for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">making an agent, then you have it living next to your software. It's another component within your toolbox. And so you're bringing LMs into these existing workflows. And that's why it's a little bit different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, you could think another way of thinking about Dagger in a nutshell is Dagger is for software engineering workflows and environments. So you're going to see us building some environments, essentially some containerized environments with some functions, and all these things can become tools that, you know, human software engineers, AI agents, use for both development side, as well as app delivery side of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So you'll see that kind of course these areas are all blending and kind of squishing together right now. We're seeing all this stuff happen in real time. So Dagger is kind of going to be one tool that you could use for that whole range.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so the question was, if Dagger is a tool to build containerized environments, what's the distinction between Dagger and Docker? So yeah, Docker has been around for a long time. And in fact, the founders of Docker are the founders of Dagger. And so we can think about the scope of the original scope of Docker was really about containerizing an application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And making that thing portable. So I can run on my laptop or Kyle's or up in Kubernetes or anywhere. So now what we're doing is we're taking a whole workflow and making that a portable thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, there's definitely multiple containers and other types of objects, but everything's everything sandboxed by default. So you get so yeah, and we'll see as we get into it. Great question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so yeah, we're writing code that is workflows itself. So that code can be go Python TypeScript, Java, PHP, we have all these different languages you can write with. And the cool thing is that you're not kind of choosing your language for Dagger and then that's the world you live in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Dagger has this cross language interop. So if I write a cool Dagger module with oh, it's it's gonna want to load. That's why I have it. Oh, yeah, amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Error occurred. Wow. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know. Okay. So I broke it. If I write a cool module with Dagger that say does like TypeScript build or something, right? I can share this on the Dagger version.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe I wrote that module in TypeScript and you're writing your modules in Python. You can just install my module and you have these native bindings in your language to work with Dagger modules cross language. So anyway, that's that's my point in that we're not when you pick a language, you still get to benefit from the whole Dagger ecosystem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">ecosystem, and we don't have images on these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.300</a></span> | <span class="t">That's OK.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.900</a></span> | <span class="t">There's some sweet animations there of code happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It's so cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, like the coolest animation you could think of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think we could probably skip forward here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so hopefully we've installed or we're downloading--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe we're still downloading Dagger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll run through real quick the basics of Dagger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So hopefully that's big enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe I'll make it a bit bigger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">There we go.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm in this dot Dagger directory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And apparently I've written go for this one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1098" target="_blank">00:18:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just-- oh, because that's the wrong project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's go to the correct project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me open that up and close all these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">OK.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1109" target="_blank">00:18:29.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm in the correct project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And in my dot Dagger, I've got this source, hello Dagger, main pie.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we would have generated when we said Dagger in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1119" target="_blank">00:18:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It'll have basically these files, but some different content.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1123" target="_blank">00:18:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's going to have the basic generated things to get you started building modules.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But we're going to say, let's see, Dagger functions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1134" target="_blank">00:18:54.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It'll show us what's available in this Dagger module that just got created.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is basically how you interact with Dagger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">This is with the Dagger CLI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1141" target="_blank">00:19:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you have this code that are just functions of how to interact with your application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, let's build one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1149" target="_blank">00:19:09.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a container.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1151" target="_blank">00:19:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">If we go down to this function, and you see we're just building building blocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1155" target="_blank">00:19:15.460</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a function that gives us a Dagger container that is from this base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1161" target="_blank">00:19:21.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And we put these files in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And we run this command.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1165" target="_blank">00:19:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in that container, when we want to do a build of our app,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we can call that other function to get that container with our code in it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.780</a></span> | <span class="t">run another command, and then get a directory from that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1177" target="_blank">00:19:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is like really basic Dagger stuff of how you create your dev tools using Dagger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">This is like good to call out here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1185" target="_blank">00:19:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So originally we had this example from Kyle where he showed us running like a container.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we said, give me a scratch container.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh wait, give me an imp from an image from Alpine or from Node or from whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can layer on more things like add a directory, a source code to that, run exec a test</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1204" target="_blank">00:20:04.780</a></span> | <span class="t">command, whatever, right, chaining these things together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So you notice I'm using this builder pattern here in code instead of in like a CLI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's all the same API under the hood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just in this, in this case, he's using a Python SDK into that same API.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1221" target="_blank">00:20:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But the same things are happening either way, same one unified cache where all that stuff is being,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1227" target="_blank">00:20:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">all those cached operations are at, and one API.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1230" target="_blank">00:20:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why it becomes really easy to use different languages, different language SDKs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1235" target="_blank">00:20:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's ultimately all one API under the hood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we got this code in this, the next step of this, where it says construct a pipeline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1243" target="_blank">00:20:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We've copied this code into that main file.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that has all of those functions like publish, build, tests, and that build_env one we looked at,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and build_env as in like your build environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1256" target="_blank">00:20:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when we run dagger functions, we'll have those shown up here with their descriptions and everything from the code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1262" target="_blank">00:21:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So now we've, at this point, like we, we've got the project that we want to build the agent in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.140</a></span> | <span class="t">We've got some dagger functions that let us build and test the project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1271" target="_blank">00:21:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We've got the project itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1272" target="_blank">00:21:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So now let's actually get the agent started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now I'll zoom out again so you can see because I jumped to the next page here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1279" target="_blank">00:21:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">which is add an AI agent to an existing project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1283" target="_blank">00:21:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we're starting from exactly where we just left off there with that previous guide where we pasted in that code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1290" target="_blank">00:21:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We have our build, build_env, publish, test, and our dagger functions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1296" target="_blank">00:21:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Lots of useful functions, but the expectation was the human was probably running those, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1302" target="_blank">00:21:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Or you were having them run in CI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1305" target="_blank">00:21:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You'd kind of set that up, but nothing really agentic yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So we have, you know, we're just running our unit tests or our build and creating a production container.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1314" target="_blank">00:21:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is what you as a developer or your CI environment are running these functions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But now we want to create an agent for developers to interact with or, you know, to run anywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But also our agents should be able to use these functions as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1330" target="_blank">00:22:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we're in this next guide.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1332" target="_blank">00:22:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're going to now create a sub module.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1335" target="_blank">00:22:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I mentioned, like, our agents want these refined environments where we give them access to exactly what tools they need to complete their tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And nothing more than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1345" target="_blank">00:22:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">No, no, wait, I thought you were going to give agents, like, every possible tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1348" target="_blank">00:22:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to let them have, like, a thousand functions that do very powerful things and just let them run crazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1355" target="_blank">00:22:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that not the best practice?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1357" target="_blank">00:22:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, yeah, maybe not based on the smiles across the room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1361" target="_blank">00:22:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1363" target="_blank">00:22:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">What happens if the tool needed changes at runtime?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1367" target="_blank">00:22:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question is, what if the tool needed changes at runtime?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">How about dynamic kind of tools, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1372" target="_blank">00:22:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So in a lot of cases, we're working with MCPs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We might have a lot of static tool kind of experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1377" target="_blank">00:22:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, what if things change?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1379" target="_blank">00:22:59.480</a></span> | <span class="t">What does happen, Kyle?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, so the main thing is, like, you want the right amount of tools for that agent to solve its task, whatever that task is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1387" target="_blank">00:23:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it needs the flexibility to be able to solve complex problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1393" target="_blank">00:23:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not just going straight down a workflow and saying, okay, I do this, and I do this, and I do this, because you don't really need an AI to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It needs the amount of tools to select, to choose its own path, to solve whatever task you throw at it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But you don't want so many tools that now this is a generalized agent that does anything, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1411" target="_blank">00:23:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It needs to have some amount of focus so that it can solve a specific set of problems really well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1417" target="_blank">00:23:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But we will see, like, in the agent loop that's going to happen, we will see the ability for the LLM to see this, like, menu of tools it has, and for it to select the right tool at the right time, given the context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1430" target="_blank">00:23:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, but yeah, definitely, like, a big part of iterating and building these agents is determining, like, the scope of the tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, the kind of the balance between flexibility and reliability, where you want it to be able to solve a breadth of problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So it needs a variety of tools that it might need. You don't know exactly what it's going to need ahead of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1452" target="_blank">00:24:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But you don't want to give it so many that now it's getting lost and confused and fails half the time, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1457" target="_blank">00:24:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's what we're going to focus on here with this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1460" target="_blank">00:24:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to create a sub-module, basically, that is kind of its playground.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a specific set of tools that lets it edit our source code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1469" target="_blank">00:24:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you've worked with maybe agent frameworks in the past that have, like, file system tools, we're actually going to build that in our own code right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1479" target="_blank">00:24:39.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's just a few lines of code, so don't let me scare you with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1482" target="_blank">00:24:42.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's the idea, is, like, we're creating these building blocks, and as you scale this up, you can consume these that other people have written.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1490" target="_blank">00:24:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't have to write it all from scratch. But for the practice of building this as a workshop, we're going to write it all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1496" target="_blank">00:24:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1497" target="_blank">00:24:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. What are we going to give the-- what are we going to give-- what are we putting this workspace?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1500" target="_blank">00:25:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">What kind of functions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1501" target="_blank">00:25:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So we do another dagger in it here, and we say dot dagger slash workspace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1506" target="_blank">00:25:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've created in our file system another subdirectory here, workspace under dot dagger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1512" target="_blank">00:25:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is another dagger module.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And this one's just going to have-- just the functions that we want the agent to have access to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1519" target="_blank">00:25:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can imagine it wants to read the files in your source tree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1523" target="_blank">00:25:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have a function, and again, a file is one of those core components of dagger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we just-- our workspace has a dagger directory, which is our source code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1533" target="_blank">00:25:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we give it a function to read a file from that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1536" target="_blank">00:25:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So it just gets the dot contents of that file.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1540" target="_blank">00:25:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's just the dagger API to say, this is a path through a file.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1544" target="_blank">00:25:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I can do lots of things with the file.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1545" target="_blank">00:25:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">One of those is to look at the contents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1548" target="_blank">00:25:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Another function it needs is to be able to write files to the workspace, obviously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1552" target="_blank">00:25:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's very similar API here where we say, okay, give me the path and also the contents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1558" target="_blank">00:25:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">to write to that file.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1560" target="_blank">00:26:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it needs to be able to know what files are in the workspace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So it needs to be able to list the files.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1565" target="_blank">00:26:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's just going to literally do a tree in that workspace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1568" target="_blank">00:26:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So it can quickly see the file structure of your code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1572" target="_blank">00:26:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now basically with those three, we have another one that we're going to look at in a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But with those three, now it can do all the code editing you might ask it to do within your file system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1583" target="_blank">00:26:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And with more complex projects, you might need more advanced capabilities of these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1589" target="_blank">00:26:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you might need to be able to read specific lines from a file or scan files or insert lines into files.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1596" target="_blank">00:26:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But with our kind of demo agent that we're building right now, it's like just the most basic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">where we can just read and write files and list the files.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1604" target="_blank">00:26:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So if the agent had access to this workspace object, it would see those functions as tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1611" target="_blank">00:26:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">read file, write file.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1614" target="_blank">00:26:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1615" target="_blank">00:26:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It will in a minute, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1616" target="_blank">00:26:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Not yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1617" target="_blank">00:26:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Not yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We haven't plugged the brain into the robot body yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1620" target="_blank">00:27:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1621" target="_blank">00:27:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So right now we're building, if you think about the agent as a robot body with a brain plugged into it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1625" target="_blank">00:27:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">we're building the robot body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1626" target="_blank">00:27:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And the brain is going to come in just a second here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1629" target="_blank">00:27:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Which could be any LLM, kind of a brain in a jar, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1632" target="_blank">00:27:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1633" target="_blank">00:27:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So our last one, finally, that I mentioned earlier, is test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1637" target="_blank">00:27:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So when it generates this code in its workspace, it needs to be able to test to make sure that the code it generated is correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it didn't, it'll get the test failures and iterate until it's producing good code, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1651" target="_blank">00:27:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is kind of the most important part of building this good agent is some sort of validation tool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1656" target="_blank">00:27:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">whether that's like a test or a lint or just something to check that what it's generated is correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1663" target="_blank">00:27:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Or maybe it's all of these things, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1665" target="_blank">00:27:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">There could be different levels of complexity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1667" target="_blank">00:27:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But anyway, here, now we've got this workspace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1670" target="_blank">00:27:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I go in my workspace, I have this exact code over here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1676" target="_blank">00:27:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And if I run, I think I have the function down here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1680" target="_blank">00:28:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">If I say dagger dot dash M, so now dash M points to a specific dagger module.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1686" target="_blank">00:28:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And I say functions, remember before we ran those dagger functions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1689" target="_blank">00:28:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">If I run dagger dash M dot dagger slash workspace functions, I'll see exactly those functions that we just created.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1699" target="_blank">00:28:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1700" target="_blank">00:28:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So the next step is we want our main dagger module to have that as a set of tools I can use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1706" target="_blank">00:28:26.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we're going to say dagger install that workspace module.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1711" target="_blank">00:28:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So now it's installed as a dependency of my main module.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1714" target="_blank">00:28:34.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So it has this object available and we'll see why that's really cool in a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1720" target="_blank">00:28:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically all your dependencies of dagger, like I mentioned, like we have, you know, I can look at this real quick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1727" target="_blank">00:28:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a big community of people building things with dagger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1732" target="_blank">00:28:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And with that we have the dagger verse, which is this massive index of like thousands of dagger modules that do different specialized things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1739" target="_blank">00:28:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But whenever you install one of these into a dagger module, it creates, if you look at my dagger JSON in this project, we have this list of dependencies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1751" target="_blank">00:29:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so your dagger module has basically its own dagger clients that is the core dagger API in addition to all of your dependencies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1761" target="_blank">00:29:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that when you're writing code, you can, like I mentioned earlier, like native in this language, you'll see all of these things available on the main dagger clients.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1771" target="_blank">00:29:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can do all these complex tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1773" target="_blank">00:29:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically we've built two modules already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1776" target="_blank">00:29:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We've built this workspace module and the main module where we're doing our tests and builds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1782" target="_blank">00:29:42.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we want to create the agent now that can take that workspace and our tests and we can actually ask for new features or modifications or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1792" target="_blank">00:29:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the next step in this guide we're looking at where we want to create an agentic function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1797" target="_blank">00:29:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1798" target="_blank">00:29:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Could we have mixed and matched, like, could we have written that workspace in TypeScript or in Go and still installed it into our Python module?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1809" target="_blank">00:30:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1810" target="_blank">00:30:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So like the other modules, any individual module can be written in any language and you can mix and match however you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1817" target="_blank">00:30:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I knew the answer to the question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1818" target="_blank">00:30:18.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I was just checking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1819" target="_blank">00:30:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But, but yeah, we see people do this a lot where they have different teams where like, you know, maybe there's a front end platform team and then a black back end platform team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1828" target="_blank">00:30:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe these folks are TypeScript, these folks are Go, but they can interop and use their stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1832" target="_blank">00:30:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1833" target="_blank">00:30:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1834" target="_blank">00:30:34.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So like everything, every task or workflow or whatever that you do with dagger is a function in your code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1840" target="_blank">00:30:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so an agent is no different, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1842" target="_blank">00:30:42.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just going to be another function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1843" target="_blank">00:30:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're going to call this one develop because we're going to ask it, we're going to give it an assignment to complete our project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1849" target="_blank">00:30:49.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's going to complete that assignment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1853" target="_blank">00:30:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So that the develop function is our agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1856" target="_blank">00:30:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is going to give us the code to copy and I'll just open it in the editor so that it looks a bit nicer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1863" target="_blank">00:31:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't worry, it's only like 500 lines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1865" target="_blank">00:31:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It's totally fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1866" target="_blank">00:31:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And you know what, it's really short.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh wait, it's not 500 lines?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1871" target="_blank">00:31:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, this is it right here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1873" target="_blank">00:31:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have a few lines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1875" target="_blank">00:31:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We have it all like spaced out nicely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1876" target="_blank">00:31:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1877" target="_blank">00:31:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have a new function called develop and it takes an assignment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1882" target="_blank">00:31:22.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And this annotated thing is just a Python way of getting us these doc strings for the parameters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1890" target="_blank">00:31:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But in different languages, like we can see back here, if we go like go, your arguments just look like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1896" target="_blank">00:31:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Where this little comment is basically the help string when you're using the Dagger CLI and say Dagger functions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1902" target="_blank">00:31:42.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It'll say the assignment parameter is assignment to complete, which is really cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1908" target="_blank">00:31:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And we see our source here, which is like our project source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1911" target="_blank">00:31:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But of course, we don't want to have to pass that as a parameter when we're calling our agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1915" target="_blank">00:31:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's this cool thing with Dagger where you say default path is slash and that's going to be the root of our Git repo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1921" target="_blank">00:32:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we don't pass in explicitly a source parameter, it's just going to pass in our Git repo as that parameter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1928" target="_blank">00:32:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now we just have to say develop, build me a cool new feature and it's going to kick off our agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1934" target="_blank">00:32:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's look at the components of the agents real quick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1937" target="_blank">00:32:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So the environment is like the main thing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1940" target="_blank">00:32:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've used that word a lot today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1942" target="_blank">00:32:22.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And hopefully a lot of people are using the same word in the same way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1946" target="_blank">00:32:26.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But you have your robot body in the brain, like Jeremy said, where your environment is basically not just the tools that it's using to complete the task, but also your inputs and outputs for the agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1962" target="_blank">00:32:42.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Any objects or state that it's working with, all of this is the environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1967" target="_blank">00:32:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we want to construct this environment and then plug in the LLM, which is our brain and say, here's your environment, here's your task slash prompt and complete the task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1979" target="_blank">00:32:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is the environment we put together where the assignment is a string input.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1987" target="_blank">00:33:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have this cool kind of way of declaratively building your prompt, right, where our assignment is the assignment to complete, but this workspace input is a workspace with tools to edit and test code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=1999" target="_blank">00:33:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So now that our agents, when we connect these things, will see this as the description of this thing they can use and say, okay, we're building up this prompt by annotating our code basically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2012" target="_blank">00:33:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so with this workspace input thing, that's referring to the sub module we just created.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2017" target="_blank">00:33:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So if--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2018" target="_blank">00:33:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">The workspace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2019" target="_blank">00:33:39.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2020" target="_blank">00:33:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2021" target="_blank">00:33:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we called that something else like Foo workspace, and we installed that, this would be with Foo workspace input, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2027" target="_blank">00:33:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We're dynamically generating all of these functions for the environment type to say, any objects of my dependencies I can have as an input or an output of my environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2041" target="_blank">00:34:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we noticed that we also have a workspace output, which is the completed task because all objects in Dagger are immutable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2051" target="_blank">00:34:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I give it an object, it's going to do a bunch of things and give me back a different object that's completed task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2059" target="_blank">00:34:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe that's like a boring detail, but the main thing is the thing I passed in is still going to be the same, but it's going to have a new version that's given me back called completed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2070" target="_blank">00:34:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I think a lot of people are dealing with this kind of stuff now, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2073" target="_blank">00:34:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">With the different APIs and like doing a bunch of JSON parsing and validation, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2078" target="_blank">00:34:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And trying to-- you know, there's different frameworks doing it in different ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2081" target="_blank">00:34:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But you could just think of it as this is our way of saying like, here are the typed inputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2085" target="_blank">00:34:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">These are typed inputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2087" target="_blank">00:34:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We're expecting a typed output back in the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2091" target="_blank">00:34:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And this gives us a way to ensure that we're getting what we actually asked for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2096" target="_blank">00:34:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2097" target="_blank">00:34:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And now, next we need our prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2100" target="_blank">00:35:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have the environment and the prompt and we give both of those the agent basically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2105" target="_blank">00:35:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So the prompt, I believe, is just a bit lower here if you're following along here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2111" target="_blank">00:35:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So it wants you to create a dot dagger slash develop prompts dot markdown.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2116" target="_blank">00:35:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And it looks like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2117" target="_blank">00:35:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll just open it again over here on my editor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2120" target="_blank">00:35:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is our prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2123" target="_blank">00:35:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we're saying you're a developer on this project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2126" target="_blank">00:35:26.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to get an assignment and the tools to complete it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2130" target="_blank">00:35:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Your assignment is dollar sign assignment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2132" target="_blank">00:35:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is basically-- it's going to be templated in by the assignment in our environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2140" target="_blank">00:35:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's going to drop that right in that prompt so that the agent itself doesn't have to go read this other variable in its environment and knows, OK, my assignment is make this cool new feature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2151" target="_blank">00:35:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we have a bit of prompt structure here, right, where if you've built a lot of these agents, you've probably kind of refined how you build your prompts and what those structures look like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2161" target="_blank">00:36:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a really simple agent, so it doesn't have a ton of structure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2164" target="_blank">00:36:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But we do say before you write code, make sure you analyze the workspace to understand the project structure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2171" target="_blank">00:36:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not just going to create some garbage and be like, cool, I made this new file, but I didn't look at the project first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2177" target="_blank">00:36:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't make unnecessary changes because sometimes you'll see, especially certain models without the right constraints, will go make the change you asked for and then change for other things and be like, cool, it looks good, ship it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2190" target="_blank">00:36:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And always run the test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2192" target="_blank">00:36:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So we do have to ask it to run the test once it's made those changes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2197" target="_blank">00:36:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not just going to see the test function and be like, oh, I should probably call that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2201" target="_blank">00:36:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to make sure to tell the LLM, like, OK, you have a tool that can validate the code you're writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2206" target="_blank">00:36:46.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Make sure you use that tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2208" target="_blank">00:36:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then don't stop until you've completed the assignment in the test pass.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2212" target="_blank">00:36:52.420</a></span>

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2222" target="_blank">00:37:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2223" target="_blank">00:37:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And this comes from experience, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2224" target="_blank">00:37:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe a third time will help too, I'll say.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2227" target="_blank">00:37:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, yeah, and maybe in all caps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2229" target="_blank">00:37:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it's like, what we find, we end up running evals on these things, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2233" target="_blank">00:37:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Where we'll try different LLMs plugged in and then we'll iterate on the prompts until we're getting the results, the consistency we want across the different ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2244" target="_blank">00:37:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, it comes from experience of knowing how they veer off track and et cetera, how we're writing these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2251" target="_blank">00:37:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and that's like what I mentioned earlier, like using something like Dagger Cloud to be able to see the visualization of all the work the agent's doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2260" target="_blank">00:37:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">If I'm frequently seeing like, okay, the agent's just calling write file and then returning, I know that, okay, I have to tell it to look at the code, I have to tell it to test the code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2269" target="_blank">00:37:49.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's going to be different for every model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2271" target="_blank">00:37:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And especially like the prompt structure is different for different models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2274" target="_blank">00:37:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it possible to implement things like reflection agents as well to police each other?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2280" target="_blank">00:38:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2281" target="_blank">00:38:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question is like, can you implement like reflection agents to police each other?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2284" target="_blank">00:38:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's something, I probably have an example of that I can show at the end if we have time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2288" target="_blank">00:38:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, like, remember, with this, each agent is just a Dagger function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2294" target="_blank">00:38:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can create all these agents layered on other agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2298" target="_blank">00:38:18.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And even in your environment, you can actually put an agent in the environment and say, hey, you have this agent at your disposal if you need it to do something, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2309" target="_blank">00:38:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And I have examples of that too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2310" target="_blank">00:38:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's like similar to the concept of like Google's A2A where you say, if you're not familiar with that, it's basically this structure where you tell an agent, listen, you can do these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2323" target="_blank">00:38:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But you also can talk to these other agents, and that's what each of these other agents do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2327" target="_blank">00:38:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you need to, you can reach out to them and say, hey, other agent, I need you to tell me how to write TypeScript.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2334" target="_blank">00:38:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And that comes back, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2335" target="_blank">00:38:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can put agents in environments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2337" target="_blank">00:38:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all just piecing functions together, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2340" target="_blank">00:39:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just the same code we've always been writing, but now there's an LLM component.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2344" target="_blank">00:39:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2345" target="_blank">00:39:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So now this line right here, line 94, most important line of the workshop because this is the agent where we've actually taken our Dagger client and .llm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2354" target="_blank">00:39:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is another type within the Dagger client.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2357" target="_blank">00:39:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You should make it bigger just for a second, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2359" target="_blank">00:39:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span

bigger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2364" target="_blank">00:39:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just--</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2369" target="_blank">00:39:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So like, we've said, all right, from the Dagger client, we need this LLM type.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2374" target="_blank">00:39:34.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We give it an

is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2557" target="_blank">00:42:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I say hopefully.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2711" target="_blank">00:45:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We have an assignment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2712" target="_blank">00:45:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was our assignment to complete.</span></div><div class="c"><span

be my repo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2717" target="_blank">00:45:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is going to give us back a directory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2720" target="_blank">00:45:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's how I use it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2721" target="_blank">00:45:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I just say develop and then do the assignment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2723" target="_blank">00:45:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's say develop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2725" target="_blank">00:45:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we didn't actually look at the project we're dagorizing yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2728" target="_blank">00:45:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But I promise it's like a view.js website.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2732" target="_blank">00:45:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's ask it to, I think, in here we say the example thing is to make the main page blue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2741" target="_blank">00:45:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll say make the main page say hello workshop people.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2750" target="_blank">00:45:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe it'll succeed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2752" target="_blank">00:45:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now we can see this happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2754" target="_blank">00:45:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We see our prompts getting passed in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2759" target="_blank">00:45:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And the little robot head of the model, which is Claude 3.5, Sonnet, saying, cool, let me do these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2766" target="_blank">00:46:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can actually see it calling tools, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2768" target="_blank">00:46:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's looking at the functions available.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2771" target="_blank">00:46:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We see that workspace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2772" target="_blank">00:46:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, it's the tools you said.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2773" target="_blank">00:46:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, list files.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2774" target="_blank">00:46:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, the ones that we made.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2775" target="_blank">00:46:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2776" target="_blank">00:46:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it figured out, okay, I can look at my files.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2779" target="_blank">00:46:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Now here's this specific file I might need to edit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2782" target="_blank">00:46:22.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me read that file.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2784" target="_blank">00:46:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it now sees the contents of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2787" target="_blank">00:46:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And while this is running, let me just open up cloud.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2790" target="_blank">00:46:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And hopefully this will load.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2792" target="_blank">00:46:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can actually see the cloud visualization of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2796" target="_blank">00:46:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it's maybe a bit easier to see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2799" target="_blank">00:46:39.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Because where it's, oh, I sign in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2801" target="_blank">00:46:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm clicking the button.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2805" target="_blank">00:46:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I think my Wi-Fi is failing me on this auth flow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2809" target="_blank">00:46:49.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But while it's running, we'll just watch this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2811" target="_blank">00:46:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the same open telemetry in both places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2814" target="_blank">00:46:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So that you're getting streaming to your terminal UI and the web UI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2818" target="_blank">00:46:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So we see it call write file with some new file contents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2821" target="_blank">00:47:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And now it says, now that we've made the change, let's run the tests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2825" target="_blank">00:47:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is the part that really might fail on this Wi-Fi.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2827" target="_blank">00:47:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it's doing an npm install and downloading a bunch of npm modules or node modules.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2832" target="_blank">00:47:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But it should pass in a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2835" target="_blank">00:47:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll just let it go and we'll talk through it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2837" target="_blank">00:47:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But we can see that our agent is actually, it wrote the files.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2841" target="_blank">00:47:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it's writing, it's running the tests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2843" target="_blank">00:47:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is really awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2844" target="_blank">00:47:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2845" target="_blank">00:47:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So this opened up over here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2846" target="_blank">00:47:26.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2847" target="_blank">00:47:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is, oh yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2854" target="_blank">00:47:34.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So we see it's saying like with exec npm install, with exec npm run test unit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2860" target="_blank">00:47:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">If we go back to our workspace in our test function, that was part of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2868" target="_blank">00:47:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is like the agent just had to call test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2871" target="_blank">00:47:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've defined what happens when you call test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2874" target="_blank">00:47:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2875" target="_blank">00:47:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not like the random ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2877" target="_blank">00:47:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes you're like, you know, make sure to test it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2879" target="_blank">00:47:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's like, I'm going to try a pie test with these crazy options.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2882" target="_blank">00:48:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're like, why did you think that was going to work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2884" target="_blank">00:48:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So instead you just give it exactly what it should be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2886" target="_blank">00:48:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We could give it more flexibility in how it runs things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2889" target="_blank">00:48:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But in this case, we already know this is how you run tests in the project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2894" target="_blank">00:48:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So we just give it a test function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2896" target="_blank">00:48:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">That's probably the biggest thing in creating reliable agents with Dagger is giving flexibility</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2903" target="_blank">00:48:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">where it's important for completing tasks and removing it where you know exactly how things are meant to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2908" target="_blank">00:48:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So you know exactly how tests need to run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2910" target="_blank">00:48:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So it doesn't need the freedom to just run any command in a container.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2914" target="_blank">00:48:34.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We know, okay, all you need to do is modify files and run this test function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2919" target="_blank">00:48:39.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And for more complex agents, maybe there's some other functions there too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2924" target="_blank">00:48:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But for this one, like, this is the amount of freedom we've given it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2927" target="_blank">00:48:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Can we, like, open another--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2929" target="_blank">00:48:49.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, hold on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2930" target="_blank">00:48:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So we got cloud.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2931" target="_blank">00:48:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, okay, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2932" target="_blank">00:48:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We got cloud.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2933" target="_blank">00:48:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2934" target="_blank">00:48:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2935" target="_blank">00:48:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll get back to my pipe dream in a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2936" target="_blank">00:48:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2937" target="_blank">00:48:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me see if I can expand this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=2939" target="_blank">00:48:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is like the visibility that we want to see when we're running these

class="t">You don't need to struggle with VMs or any other versions or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3170" target="_blank">00:52:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It just, it's done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3171" target="_blank">00:52:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then inside of that somewhere, there's Node container that happened, right, in order to create this environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3177" target="_blank">00:52:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">The build env and the build and all that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3179" target="_blank">00:52:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And that, again, it's all just nested inside of there and cached and everything else automatically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3186" target="_blank">00:53:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can kind of just do this with a very bare bones machine set up and everything will just work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3192" target="_blank">00:53:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3193" target="_blank">00:53:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we can see that we probably won't get to run this part locally just because I don't, we'll come back to it if it finishes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3200" target="_blank">00:53:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But anyway, I'll just describe this flow here where we say, okay, we're in shell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3205" target="_blank">00:53:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So that happens, like we ran that develop thing and it gave us back something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3210" target="_blank">00:53:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But now in Dagger, like I keep saying, we're in shell Dagger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3214" target="_blank">00:53:34.420</a></span> | <span class="t">When you type Dagger and get into that, this view, it is a shell just like bash, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3221" target="_blank">00:53:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Where we can actually do things like create variables and chain things together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3226" target="_blank">00:53:46.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what we could do if this finished is say, okay, let's actually save that, the output of this thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3233" target="_blank">00:53:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Because remember, it returns a directory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3235" target="_blank">00:53:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Save that to a variable called completed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3237" target="_blank">00:53:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we could pass that to our other functions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3239" target="_blank">00:53:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Because remember, they, they default to using our get source from our machine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3243" target="_blank">00:54:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But we could, we could pass in that optional directory to all of our functions to say, use this directory instead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3249" target="_blank">00:54:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So now I could actually run the whole thing as like a local, like I could see the results of this before even saving it to my machine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3258" target="_blank">00:54:18.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me just go over here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3259" target="_blank">00:54:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know why I keep any of this folder, but we'll go to the correct directory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3268" target="_blank">00:54:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll open another shell here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3270" target="_blank">00:54:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll just type in part of this command.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3273" target="_blank">00:54:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">because what, what I can do is I can run the output from the agent as like, I can run the whole site.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3280" target="_blank">00:54:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I can build it and serve it to my machine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3282" target="_blank">00:54:42.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And I can see what it's built before even save it back to my disk to say, yes, this is a good solution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3288" target="_blank">00:54:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So once we get this connection here, just waiting on pipes to connect to each other, and we'll, we'll let that run for a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3301" target="_blank">00:55:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But the main thing is we can pass this around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3304" target="_blank">00:55:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We can run all of our functions with that completed directory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3307" target="_blank">00:55:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then finally say, all right, we say export.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3310" target="_blank">00:55:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">That saves it back to your disk and we're done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3313" target="_blank">00:55:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So the next step is, all right, we're good with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3315" target="_blank">00:55:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We know how to use this agent locally to ask it to make cool tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3319" target="_blank">00:55:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">That's fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3320" target="_blank">00:55:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But my, my people requesting features on my site, they don't have this installed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3326" target="_blank">00:55:26.420</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't have Docker and Dagger installed on the machine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3329" target="_blank">00:55:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't want to use Dagger shell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3331" target="_blank">00:55:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">They just want to go to GitHub and say, make this new feature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3334" target="_blank">00:55:34.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the next step here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3335" target="_blank">00:55:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And it sounds ambitious, but it's really quick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3338" target="_blank">00:55:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've got plenty of time to look at the solution here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3341" target="_blank">00:55:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll look at it in Python once again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3344" target="_blank">00:55:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the first thing we're going to do is actually install another dependency from the Daggerverse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3349" target="_blank">00:55:49.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is my module called GitHub issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3353" target="_blank">00:55:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's basically if we go to Daggerverse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3355" target="_blank">00:55:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But we saw it installed earlier when you showed us that Dagger JSON.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3358" target="_blank">00:55:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3359" target="_blank">00:55:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's because I skipped ahead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3360" target="_blank">00:56:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3361" target="_blank">00:56:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3362" target="_blank">00:56:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3363" target="_blank">00:56:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we search for that, and we have this module called GitHub issue, it's got a bunch of functions that let us do things with GitHub issues, like we can list GitHub issues in a repo, we can list the comments on a particular issue, we can write comments, we can create pull request comments, all kinds of things with GitHub issues and GitHub pull requests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3389" target="_blank">00:56:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So with this module where I've just basically used the GitHub Go SDK in this Go module to connect my Dagger functions to the API calls, I can install this in my Python project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3403" target="_blank">00:56:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And now I can have the ability to work with GitHub issues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3407" target="_blank">00:56:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so all it needs is a GitHub token.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3409" target="_blank">00:56:49.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we create, we add another function to our code called develop issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3415" target="_blank">00:56:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So remember, we created develop, now it's develop issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3419" target="_blank">00:56:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And all this is going to do is say we have a GitHub issue out there with our feature requests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3423" target="_blank">00:57:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to read that GitHub issue, give it to our agent, the agent's going to do all its things, then give us back a directory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3429" target="_blank">00:57:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to take that directory and make a pull request.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3432" target="_blank">00:57:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, so like really similar to like the assignment that we gave it, instead, it's going to be reading the GitHub issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3438" target="_blank">00:57:18.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And instead of just getting the directory back ourselves, we put the directory into a PR.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3442" target="_blank">00:57:22.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep, so we can see the code here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3443" target="_blank">00:57:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3444" target="_blank">00:57:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is the entire thing here where we're not writing a new agent to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3448" target="_blank">00:57:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We're using our other agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3449" target="_blank">00:57:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We're just, we're wrapping it with some other pieces to say, go here to get the assignment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3454" target="_blank">00:57:34.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Once it's done, put that completed work over here, which is the from here was like read a GitHub issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3462" target="_blank">00:57:42.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we get that assignment and I can open the editor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3466" target="_blank">00:57:46.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's probably easier to see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3468" target="_blank">00:57:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so we get that GitHub issue from that issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3474" target="_blank">00:57:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We get the assignment from the issue body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3476" target="_blank">00:57:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We pass that to our develop function because this is our agent and say, here's your assignment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3482" target="_blank">00:58:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's the source, which came from that same defaulted input argument.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3488" target="_blank">00:58:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we get the issue title and URL, which is going to be really cool because then we actually, in GitHub, automatically have the new pull request linked to the GitHub issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3502" target="_blank">00:58:22.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Just by having this, the body say closes this issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3506" target="_blank">00:58:26.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's going to create a pull request.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3508" target="_blank">00:58:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this whole thing, like you can run this part locally too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3511" target="_blank">00:58:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't have to run this part in GitHub.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3513" target="_blank">00:58:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But it just takes the GitHub token and an issue and the repo name so it knows where to put the PR.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3520" target="_blank">00:58:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it does that whole flow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3524" target="_blank">00:58:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But we actually want that to run in GitHub.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3526" target="_blank">00:58:46.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's super easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3529" target="_blank">00:58:49.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We just saw the code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3530" target="_blank">00:58:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Now we create a GitHub Actions workflow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3533" target="_blank">00:58:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">The first two things we need to do is in the repo, we need to create two repo secrets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3540" target="_blank">00:59:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">One for a cloud token.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3541" target="_blank">00:59:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, that part's optional.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3543" target="_blank">00:59:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you want to see all those things happen in Diger Cloud, you just put that token in the environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3547" target="_blank">00:59:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then whatever LLM key you're using, so the same one I used locally, is going to be in that repo secret.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3553" target="_blank">00:59:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I go over here in my repo and I say, and I zoom out a bit so I get all the buttons, I say settings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3562" target="_blank">00:59:22.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We wait for the page to load.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3563" target="_blank">00:59:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then down here under Secrets and Variables, Actions, I have two repo secrets here that we just saw from that screenshot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3577" target="_blank">00:59:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Make it big again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3578" target="_blank">00:59:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3579" target="_blank">00:59:39.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's one more thing, which is, let's see, that's how we get our Dagger Cloud token to paste in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3588" target="_blank">00:59:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a little checkbox we have to press over here to let GitHub Actions create PRs, because that's disabled by default.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3597" target="_blank">00:59:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I go under, okay, under Actions, General, and then at the very bottom, there's this checkbox, allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3611" target="_blank">01:00:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've done that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3612" target="_blank">01:00:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I just need to create a workflow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3616" target="_blank">01:00:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And the workflow is super short.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3618" target="_blank">01:00:18.420</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a thing you can copy paste, and I'll open it up over here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3623" target="_blank">01:00:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Under GitHub Workflows, we have Develop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3626" target="_blank">01:00:26.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now we have this GitHub Actions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3629" target="_blank">01:00:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">If you ever haven't used GitHub Actions, I'll explain this real quick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3632" target="_blank">01:00:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's basically a CI platform, and we have, with this configuration, we tell it when events happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3641" target="_blank">01:00:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Go do these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3643" target="_blank">01:00:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this case, we say, when a GitHub issue is labeled, and the label is called develop, then run this command.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3652" target="_blank">01:00:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And this command is the Dagger call develop issue with those arguments, like GitHub token, the issue ID, and the repo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3659" target="_blank">01:00:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And these things are all coming from GitHub Actions automatically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3662" target="_blank">01:01:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, the environment's GitHub token is created here, where we say, this command needs a GitHub token with permissions to write contents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3674" target="_blank">01:01:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Contents are, like, commits to your project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3677" target="_blank">01:01:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Read the issues and write pull requests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3680" target="_blank">01:01:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we've put that in the environments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3683" target="_blank">01:01:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We've given it the API key for our LLM and the cloud token.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3687" target="_blank">01:01:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now, just by running this Dagger call, that connects the dots where GitHub Actions, whenever we create that label, is going to run that Dagger function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3696" target="_blank">01:01:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And that Dagger function has all the capabilities to run the agents and open a PR.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3700" target="_blank">01:01:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's, like, us in the Dagger shell when we call, when we are running, like, the develop function or some other build function or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3708" target="_blank">01:01:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">This is just having GitHub Actions run the develop issue function for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3712" target="_blank">01:01:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3713" target="_blank">01:01:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Why are you having GitHub Actions do it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3715" target="_blank">01:01:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So that it can go into the issues?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3717" target="_blank">01:01:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're having GitHub Actions do it because we want this flow to be automated inside GitHub.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3722" target="_blank">01:02:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll show the flow real quick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3723" target="_blank">01:02:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But it can run anywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3724" target="_blank">01:02:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can run it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3725" target="_blank">01:02:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3726" target="_blank">01:02:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3727" target="_blank">01:02:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't matter where it runs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3728" target="_blank">01:02:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So this just happens to be GitHub Actions because we're already in a GitHub repo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3733" target="_blank">01:02:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It's free because this is, like, we're not using any crazy compute to run this thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3739" target="_blank">01:02:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And most of the hard stuff is happening on your LLM that you're paying for somewhere else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3742" target="_blank">01:02:22.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And they have better internet connection at GitHub than we did today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3744" target="_blank">01:02:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3745" target="_blank">01:02:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's say -- let's create a new issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span

--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3759" target="_blank">01:02:39.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Hello, workshop.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3765" target="_blank">01:02:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll create this GitHub issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3768" target="_blank">01:02:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And remember, this whole thing kicks off when I add the label develop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3772" target="_blank">01:02:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I've already run this on this repo and obviously made a typo as well at one point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3777" target="_blank">01:02:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you don't have it there, you can just say foo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3780" target="_blank">01:03:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And you'll have a button to say create a new label develop.</span></div><div

how much prompt modification does the agent have?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3844" target="_blank">01:04:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Dagger has its own system prompt that it adds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3846" target="_blank">01:04:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">That kind of guides it towards like how you use tools within Dagger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3850" target="_blank">01:04:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So it knows like call the select methods and list functions and those things we saw it doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3857" target="_blank">01:04:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You can add more to the

yeah, there is a default one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3862" target="_blank">01:04:22.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3863" target="_blank">01:04:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to make further edits because the agent is not able to develop the right code analogies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3870" target="_blank">01:04:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3871" target="_blank">01:04:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">How do we correct after the developer before the rest of the stuff starts?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3876" target="_blank">01:04:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So if the agent does something, if it calls develop and it runs and it produces something that we say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3880" target="_blank">01:04:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, that's not right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3881" target="_blank">01:04:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">How do we go back and say, make these changes?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3884" target="_blank">01:04:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Can we just edit the completed source?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3889" target="_blank">01:04:49.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh

want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3894" target="_blank">01:04:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">If you see the source and say, oh, it needs one more change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3897" target="_blank">01:04:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Or I can

target="_blank">01:05:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's some more changes to make because you didn't get it quite right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3909" target="_blank">01:05:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we'll see that happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3911" target="_blank">01:05:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3912" target="_blank">01:05:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Go ahead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3913" target="_blank">01:05:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">The test directory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3926" target="_blank">01:05:26.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it should.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3928" target="_blank">01:05:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3929" target="_blank">01:05:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question was giving the agent access to the test directory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3933" target="_blank">01:05:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I think in tests, it runs that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3936" target="_blank">01:05:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think in our workspace, we just give it the full source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3940" target="_blank">01:05:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We give it the full source of the repo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3942" target="_blank">01:05:42.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So it could get down in there if it wanted to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3945" target="_blank">01:05:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3946" target="_blank">01:05:46.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's kind of a funny thing, like making sure the tests pass, because sometimes if the agent broke the test,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3952" target="_blank">01:05:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">it'll go change the test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3954" target="_blank">01:05:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes that's correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3955" target="_blank">01:05:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3956" target="_blank">01:05:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes we actually change the behavior and the tests need to be updated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3959" target="_blank">01:05:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But maybe more often, that's not correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3961" target="_blank">01:06:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So you might want to maybe have that as part of your prompting or part of your validation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3965" target="_blank">01:06:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Say, make sure the agent didn't change the test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3968" target="_blank">01:06:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Or it's kind of tough to decide, like, whether that's correct or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3973" target="_blank">01:06:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3974" target="_blank">01:06:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I noticed that there wasn't a Dagger install step, because I've got behind this little action.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3980" target="_blank">01:06:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So in --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3981" target="_blank">01:06:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a one-liner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3982" target="_blank">01:06:22.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3983" target="_blank">01:06:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So in our workflow, we installed Dagger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3987" target="_blank">01:06:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's really just -- there's a Dagger for GitHub action.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3991" target="_blank">01:06:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we just said --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3992" target="_blank">01:06:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">What, three-liner in the --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3993" target="_blank">01:06:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Three-liner, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3994" target="_blank">01:06:34.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So we said this version of Dagger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=3996" target="_blank">01:06:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But this installs Dagger in your GitHub actions runtime, basically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4001" target="_blank">01:06:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So we used Checkout to check out a repo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4003" target="_blank">01:06:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then this to install Dagger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4006" target="_blank">01:06:46.420</a></span> | <span class="t">The dependencies, like when you install the dependencies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4010" target="_blank">01:06:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">like you start with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4014" target="_blank">01:06:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4015" target="_blank">01:06:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that happen automatically?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4016" target="_blank">01:06:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4017" target="_blank">01:06:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is -- in our Dagger JSON, we have all of our dependencies listed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4024" target="_blank">01:07:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you don't have to say, like, Dagger install or anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4027" target="_blank">01:07:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">When we say Dagger install, it adds it to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4030" target="_blank">01:07:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we just run it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4031" target="_blank">01:07:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4032" target="_blank">01:07:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't have to do anything like NPM install like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4035" target="_blank">01:07:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It just -- it knows to make sure your client's generated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4039" target="_blank">01:07:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But that is the nice thing about having those dependencies, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4044" target="_blank">01:07:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">in the -- in a file saved in Git, you know, alongside the project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4049" target="_blank">01:07:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So because, like, what we've done essentially, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4052" target="_blank">01:07:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">when we first got this project, this view app project,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4055" target="_blank">01:07:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">it didn't have any Dagger.</span></div><div

run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4060" target="_blank">01:07:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we said, oh, well, let's Dagger init in this thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4063" target="_blank">01:07:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we got that little dot Dagger</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4065" target="_blank">01:07:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">where we started developing our build and test functions, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4068" target="_blank">01:07:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Kind of like our tools for development or for CI, just alongside.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4072" target="_blank">01:07:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then in there is where we've been installing more modules,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4076" target="_blank">01:07:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">like the workspace, the GitHub issues module, like anything else you would need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4082" target="_blank">01:08:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So now -- and that's all in Git.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4084" target="_blank">01:08:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So the thing's now like this

the code for that, it's just like --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4196" target="_blank">01:09:56.420</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:10:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is writing Dagger code, basically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4215" target="_blank">01:10:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">How does this relate to MCP?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4218" target="_blank">01:10:18.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And will you use Dagger to implement MCP servers?</span></div><div class="c"><span

having multiple MCPs as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4227" target="_blank">01:10:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">different mechanism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4228" target="_blank">01:10:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4229" target="_blank">01:10:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So one way to think about it is we were kind of doing this thing with Dagger modules before MCP came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4236" target="_blank">01:10:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">on the scene.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4237" target="_blank">01:10:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then obviously we're like, oh, this is super aligned with the way we think things should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4242" target="_blank">01:10:42.420</a></span> | <span class="t">be in a lot of ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4244" target="_blank">01:10:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can today even take a Dagger module and you can say Dagger dash M, the name of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4251" target="_blank">01:10:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">the module, MCP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4253" target="_blank">01:10:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you can expose a Dagger module as an MCP server, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4258" target="_blank">01:10:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, and we've got some more things that we'll be probably sharing soon about that kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4263" target="_blank">01:11:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4264" target="_blank">01:11:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But yes, we think the vision is compatible in that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4267" target="_blank">01:11:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, you can use the MCP ecosystem as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4272" target="_blank">01:11:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so there's a few different layers here, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4274" target="_blank">01:11:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">There's within our

target="_blank">01:11:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">our internal implementation of MCP to talk between modules within Dagger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4284" target="_blank">01:11:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can also take a Dagger module, expose it as an MCP server, and then in, I don't know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4291" target="_blank">01:11:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">the near future, next week

target="_blank">01:11:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">them into Dagger as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4297" target="_blank">01:11:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4298" target="_blank">01:11:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I wanted to be clear, like the internal, the internal implementation, it's before MCP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4304" target="_blank">01:11:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not MCP per se, but it's very much logically, you can think of it in a similar way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4310" target="_blank">01:11:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

it ends up being practically, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4316" target="_blank">01:11:56.420</a></span> | <span

then let Dagger</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4664" target="_blank">01:17:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">do the asynchronous

target="_blank">01:17:49.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, is my understanding that Dagger is sort of this asynchronous AI agent that does things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4674" target="_blank">01:17:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">on its own but with guardrails, not just leaving a cloud code or something in a

Dagger in a certain sense, too?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4689" target="_blank">01:18:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But Dagger gives you this platform to create these software engineering workflows that can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4694" target="_blank">01:18:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">be used for shipping software, that can be used for developing software, you know, and the environments</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4699" target="_blank">01:18:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can use them as a platform engineer or as a developer, but then you can also hand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4704" target="_blank">01:18:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">them off to

powerful, the fact that you can use that same platform to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4710" target="_blank">01:18:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">all those things and to create those guardrails, like you say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4713" target="_blank">01:18:33.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Got it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4715" target="_blank">01:18:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">The one thing I want you to show, and you've got one minute, can you just show your terminal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4718" target="_blank">01:18:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and just let's get vibey for just one second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4721" target="_blank">01:18:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're connected to an LLM right now, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4724" target="_blank">01:18:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So go ahead, just like, let's talk to this LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4727" target="_blank">01:18:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So it turns out that we've been using the shell mode, which lets you, you know, kind of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4733" target="_blank">01:18:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">very declaratively say, like, I want container from Alpine with this file and give me a terminal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4738" target="_blank">01:18:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">into that or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4739" target="_blank">01:18:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever.</span></div><div

chatting now directly with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4745" target="_blank">01:19:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">connected LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4746" target="_blank">01:19:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And this LLM can see all the Dagger objects you have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4750" target="_blank">01:19:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So another way you can use Dagger is you can just say like, all right, I'm just going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4754" target="_blank">01:19:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">create this container.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4755" target="_blank">01:19:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm going to say, hey, LLM, you see that container?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4758" target="_blank">01:19:18.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Why don't you write some software in it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4760" target="_blank">01:19:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can get that kind of, that kind of workflow going too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4764" target="_blank">01:19:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So he's, there you go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4765" target="_blank">01:19:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So he's actually saying like, hey, give me a Python container.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4768" target="_blank">01:19:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's going to actually look and see what methods exist in the Dagger API.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4774" target="_blank">01:19:34.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's, oh, there's this container method in the API, which we were using earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4778" target="_blank">01:19:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it's going to like, you know, decide, oh, I'm going to use container, maybe from container</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4783" target="_blank">01:19:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">from container with exec to execute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4785" target="_blank">01:19:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So these are just, it's exploring the Dagger API right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4789" target="_blank">01:19:49.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And now it's going to like, it's actually pulling a Python 3.11 container, then it can do things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4794" target="_blank">01:19:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4795" target="_blank">01:19:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4796" target="_blank">01:19:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, it's actually using containers, like kind of like computer use or something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4800" target="_blank">01:20:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">like that.</span></div><div

show that side of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4806" target="_blank">01:20:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, you know, we're trying to show the guardrails.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzb1a24hF-o&t=4809" target="_blank">01:20:09.420</a></span> | <span
