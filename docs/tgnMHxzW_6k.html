I printed them out. I taped them. I kid you not. I taped them under the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">cover of my time block planner so I could measure those every night and I got into it. And Jesse,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=37" target="_blank">00:00:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">here's what happened.

A lot of things scheduled. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">doing something like three to four interviews or talks. Some of them I'm giving, some of them on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.620</a></span> | <span class="t">other side of. I was giving lectures, we're podcasting, all sorts of stuff going on. Super busy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">time. And I was getting there at the end of each night to write down the metrics of what I did that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.300</a></span> | <span class="t">day. And I was having one I could write down or maybe just like two that I could write down. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I wasn't getting anywhere near making the progress on the stuff that my metrics would have me make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">progress on. Last night, I finally just gave up and I actually wrote this stress default. I was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not even going to bother writing one metric. It's too depressing. I'm stressed out about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm making progress on nothing. I'm declaring bankruptcy. I'm not even going to write down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.700</a></span> | <span class="t">any metrics. So this is what I want to talk about today. The joys and sorrows of tracking metrics in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.540</a></span> | <span class="t">your life. So I want to remind us like why I think metrics are important. I want to talk about what goes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.060</a></span> | <span class="t">wrong with metrics, including what went wrong with me. And then I want to talk about in the third act,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">how to handle metrics smarter, which will include how I ended up actually responding to my heart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.820</a></span> | <span class="t">failure this week and sort of fixing my metric practice. All right. So that is our goal. Today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we're talking metrics. We'll start with act one, the promise of metrics. All right. So we got to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">into it. If you're not a longtime listener, you might be wondering, what does he really mean by metrics?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a good question. These can mean multiple different things. So if a lot of people like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">quantified life type people out there for them, metrics mean just gathering data about your day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that you will then later look back at for trends. All right. So health type stuff, health biomarkers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe wear a whoop strap and whatever you do, you're going to collect this data and you're going to look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">at it for trends. It doesn't have to be health. Jesse, remember we had David DeWayne on, what was that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like a couple of months ago? Yeah. And he talked about, he was tracking every day, just how happy he was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.700</a></span> | <span class="t">like how good of a day it is. So that's what some people think about with metrics, right? It's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">what I mean. When I talk about metrics, what I mean about is short little coded sequences of letters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">that you use to track whether or not you did certain things or to what degree you did them. So it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.340</a></span> | <span class="t">gathering data to analyze, it's tracking action. So here are some sample metrics. These are of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.340</a></span> | <span class="t">binary nature. You either did them or not. I exercised or not. I stretched or not. I spent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">one-on-one time with, you know, one of my kids today or not. I practiced my guitar, right? Those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.860</a></span> | <span class="t">are sample things you could have metrics for. It's things you either did or you didn't, and you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.740</a></span> | <span class="t">something you can write down to indicate that you did. Some metrics are quantitative. So it's not just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.260</a></span> | <span class="t">did I do it or not, but to what degree. So for example, a step count, here's how many steps I took</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">today where you presumably maybe have some sort of minimum you're hoping to beat. Maybe the number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of pages you read in a book is something else you might track. So it's not just that I read or not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">but how much did I read? And maybe you have a goal of how much reading you want to try to get to most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.500</a></span> | <span class="t">nights, but maybe sometimes you even go farther. The goal with this style of metrics is to stay on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">track with the things that you care about, all right? Because this is a problem I think we face</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">with time management and organization that it's a, it's possible that you're super on the ball with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.100</a></span> | <span class="t">your, your, your organizational tactics, right?

Uh, you look at your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">week, you're fitting in your work, your time block plan, your intention about your time. You have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">shut down rituals. You're, you're tracking and organizing your tasks very carefully in full capture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.840</a></span> | <span class="t">based task management systems. You are doing a lot of stuff and you're getting a lot of stuff done,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.220</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's possible that the things you were doing, though, making you very busy are not actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">moving you closer to your definition of the deep life. You're doing stuff, but not the stuff that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">matters. This is where metrics can be very helpful because you run whatever time management organizational</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">systems you want. But at the end of the day, you said, did I make progress on the things that really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">matter to me? And knowing that you'll be recording this day after day really influences the way that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">go about your day. And you start putting aside time. This is the theory. You start putting aside time for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">these things to make sure that you can mark it off on your metric tracking. It's a way of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.820</a></span> | <span class="t">continually nudging your activity towards things that matter. This was a big breakthrough for me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">when my own practices, I got very organized. I've long been very organized. I'm good at managing my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.180</a></span> | <span class="t">time. I'm good at keeping up at work and seeing what's due when and making sure that I started early</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">enough. But I was falling behind. I found this in my life. I was falling behind on things. I mattered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not reading as much as I should be reading. I'm not spending time with these people that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">important to me. I'm not spending enough time with them. I'm not prioritizing this. I'm busy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">but not doing the things that matter. Metrics made a big difference to me. That's why I include them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.140</a></span> | <span class="t">in my time block planner. I talk about them in multiple of my books. I've talked about them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's what I talk about when I'm talking about metrics. So again, you would have for each of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">these things a short code. So did I exercise or not? If I did, I write down EX in the metric tracking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.940</a></span> | <span class="t">block, my time block planner. Do I stretch? If I did, maybe I'll write STR. That's my code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">One-on-one time with kid, kid. Step count, S colon number for step count, right? And I actually will,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">this is what I said earlier and I was like, oh, I planned out my metrics for the fall. I actually have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.340</a></span> | <span class="t">those codes written out. I tape them on my planner. Here's the codes I'm using to keep track of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.300</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff. So it's a good idea. I think if you care about the deep life and not just being productive,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">it matters. But I failed. I had a really hard week and I sort of gave up temporarily on my metrics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Why did I fail? This brings us to act two when metrics go awry. So there's four main problems</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">people have with my style of activity tracking metrics. There's one big one, which I think is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the most important. It's the one that really I had issues with. I'll do that one last. Let me get with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.700</a></span> | <span class="t">the three smaller ones first, because these also pop up a lot as well. Vagueness is a big issue with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">metric tracking, right? You have a thing you're tracking with a metric that is so vague that either</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">everything counts or nothing counts. It could be either thing. Like, for example, you might've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">written down, like, I connect with my daughter. I mean, what does that mean? What does it take to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">actually write down the code for that on your daily metric tracking? Does it count if you high-fived her</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.140</a></span> | <span class="t">in the hallway? Or does it require, like, you went to a father-daughter dance and, you know, shared a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">milkshake in a heartfelt conversation before you allowed the market down? It's too vague. That's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">specific enough. So that's a problem a lot of people have is they're too vague. And then they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">like, I don't even know what, I can either put this metric down every day. I never put it down. I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">know. And you kind of give up on it. The other side is it's specific, but it's impossible that you just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">put something down that it's not really something that on an average day you're likely to get to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You put down like, yeah, I would bike a hundred miles a day. That'd be great. And you're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, that takes a long time. It takes many hours to bike a hundred hours. I don't normally have enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">time to bike a hundred miles every day.

So you're unrealistic in the difficulty or time consumption of a singular metric. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">another big problem. Spreadsheet syndrome is a third one. Then instead of just having a simple code you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.340</a></span> | <span class="t">jot down, like in something like a time block planner, you start putting into the spreadsheets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">We know these type of people. I got to put the data into the whatever so that I can have the pie chart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and the pie chart is going to dynamically alter and it's going to be really nicely color coded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I made it a 3D pie chart and I adjusted what the drop shadow is. So it looks really good. And I'm looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">for the pie chart to change. That's all friction. And it's going to eventually get annoying enough that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it's been a hard day and you're tired and you don't want to open up Microsoft Excel for 15 minutes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.220</a></span> | <span class="t">and you stop metric tracking. That's why I'm a big fan. And you should just have some couple letters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.740</a></span> | <span class="t">You jot them down, takes 10 seconds and your metric tracking is done. So spreadsheet syndrome is another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">problem. But the biggest problem of all with metric tracking practices, and this is what really stung me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.100</a></span> | <span class="t">this week. Going with an inventory of what's important to you as opposed to a realistic plan for what you want to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">on a regular basis. These are not the same thing. So if you sit down, you say, okay, I want to list out what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">important to me. And then I'll have a metric related to each of those things. Now you don't want to leave things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">out. I'm trying to list things that are important to you. They're like, well, I don't want to leave this part of my life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It's important to me. That better be on the list. Otherwise I'm signaling to myself. It's not. Well, this thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">over here is very important to me. I should put that on the list too. I need a metric for that. And before you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">know it, your list of metrics you're tracking is an inventory of everything that's important to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And the possibility for you to actually make progress on that many things on a regular basis is basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">impossible. It's just too many things you want to make progress on. That's what happened to me. I went</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">through an exercise when I was up in New England where I checked back in as I do most summers after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">my birthday about what are the areas of my life that are important to me? What am I trying to do with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">them right now? And I listed out all these different areas. There are six different areas. I ended up with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">actually many more than six metrics because I had at least one metric for each of those six areas,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.380</a></span> | <span class="t">but for the one related to health, I actually track four metrics for my health. It's exercise,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">stretching, step count, and then there's like a food and diet sort of like quality of the food I eat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of thing. So it's 10 metrics. It was just too many. I mean, I've been busy. I had a busy calendar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and I was like, I can't make progress on 10 things. In fact, I could do maybe one or two of these things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.380</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe. And I was super stressed having so many things I wasn't writing down because what I had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">really done was inventory to everything that was important to me, as opposed to saying, here is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">reasonable mix of things I could make progress on on most days that would be important to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's probably the number one problem. It was my problem as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So how do we fix this? What's a smarter way to approach activity tracking metrics? Well, that brings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.260</a></span> | <span class="t">us to act three, making metrics work. There are four things that I did to help clean up my metric</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">track. I did this last night. I wrote this all out after I get the stress default. I was like, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I got to fix this. And these, I think are the main four tools you have to make activity-based metric</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.300</a></span> | <span class="t">tracking actually be sustainable. Number one, you can consider doing multiple choice metrics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So what that means is you have multiple things that are important to you, but it's unreasonable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">perhaps to make progress on all of those things every day. It would be a real laundry list. What you do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.740</a></span> | <span class="t">instead is you have a multiple choice approach to it where you might say, for example, here's five</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">things that are important to me. I have a metric code for each. I want to try to do one of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.260</a></span> | <span class="t">per day. So my goal is each day to write down one of these metric codes. If I can get to like one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">these things each day, get a little bit of effort, I'll consider that a success. So now you're getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">more reasonable. You can have more areas you care about, but you're not trying to unreasonably make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.220</a></span> | <span class="t">progress on everything every day. Autopilot scheduling makes a huge difference as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So many different metrics. If you're going to succeed in actually doing that activity every day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it has to be integrated to your schedule in a way that you don't have to think about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.020</a></span> | <span class="t">We're using this with exercise. This is how I handle exercise. When we're in out of the summer and during</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.780</a></span> | <span class="t">a normal semester, I know when I do my exercise. My wife knows when I do my exercise. It's part of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">schedule. This is just when I do my exercise. So it's a regular part of my schedule. It's what we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.220</a></span> | <span class="t">call autopilot scheduling. That makes sure it gets done. If I instead just started each day and said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to try to find time, 45 minutes at some point today to exercise, what's my hit rate going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.700</a></span> | <span class="t">be? 20% of days, I happen to have enough time and enough energy to do it. So the more things you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.780</a></span> | <span class="t">actually find a regular time and day to do it, so an autopilot schedule, the more successful that'll be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So your metrics should have a lot of autopilot scheduling going on. You really shouldn't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">four or five things that you want to make progress on every day that have no fixed time that you always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">do when you schedule.

You do not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">want a lot of things that aren't autopiloted scheduled. The third thing to do to make metrics work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">is to eliminate, combine, and simplify it. Just say, hey, look, there's a lot of things. I can't work on all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">these things. I want a good sampling of things that matter to me that I want to do regularly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And the other stuff, you know, I will try to make progress on it at maybe a bigger time scale. If</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">you're a multi-scale planner, you can make progress on it like at the strategic plan schedule or the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">weekly scale. Like, you know, hey, do I have a day today that I could go like see my brother who lives</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">nearby and we can like get together and have lunch? Like, okay, I do this week. I didn't last week,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">but I do this week, right? Then maybe that's the right scale to be working on that thing that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">important to you. So you might want to simplify or eliminate the stuff that you really are trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.820</a></span> | <span class="t">to track every day. That doesn't have to be everything that's important to you. Doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.740</a></span> | <span class="t">have to have progress made at that scale. Combining means you might find a way to make progress on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple things to report it in one step, right? It's like walking my dog also gets me steps and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">always call my mom when I do it, right? And now you're, you have like one activity that's handling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.780</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple steps or you want to have like a hobby that's important to you, but you want to spend time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.740</a></span> | <span class="t">with your kids. Oh, why don't we come up with something that I do with my kids? It's like a joint</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">hobby. So you can do combining as well. The final thing is probably the most important is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.980</a></span> | <span class="t">go sequential and slow down. Like I can't do all these things at the same time. Okay. I mean, I want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to hypothetically like learn to play guitar and I want to speak Spanish and I want to learn how to program</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">a computer and like these three things I think would make my life richer. To try to make progress on all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.900</a></span> | <span class="t">three of those things every day is crazy. To even try to do multiple choice on those three things is kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.100</a></span> | <span class="t">of crazy. Like, well, I want to work on one of these each day and you're switching back and forth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">between these things. It's, you know, this is, this could be like way overkill. So maybe what you stay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.900</a></span> | <span class="t">instead is like, let's just slow down. That's a slow productivity tactic. I'm working on Spanish right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">now. I'm just going to do that for the next four months or six months. And when I feel like I got to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.980</a></span> | <span class="t">a good place, then maybe I'll have a season I'm working on, like trying to learn some guitar and we'll see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.820</a></span> | <span class="t">how that goes. Programming, I don't know, maybe next year. It's interesting, but let's just push that off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Take your time. Life is long. Sequential. I'll do this when it's done. I'll work on something else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So not trying to necessarily have everything that's important to you be active all at the same time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So that's basically what I've done. My new metrics, I have a big multiple choice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.460</a></span> | <span class="t">that makes things much simpler. I eliminated some things that I was tracking. I'm going sequential on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">some other things like, okay, let me just work on this. Now this other thing I'll work on in a different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">season. I moderated Jesse. I was, my goal was to spend about 30 hours a week on my Halloween</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">decorations and I moderated. That's now 27 and a half hours a week because 30 hours was just a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit too much. So 27 and a half hours a week on my Halloween decorations. But there we go. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.760</a></span> | <span class="t">metrics are important. The right type of metrics. It really helps make sure that you're not just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">organized, but you're organized towards stuff that matters. But don't beat yourself up if you struggle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">with metrics because I kind of like invented this approach and I still completely screwed up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">last week. And then I had to remember my own medicine. All right, let's get reasonable here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a process. And also, hey, the fact that I had turned these off while I was away, like that also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is a thing. I was on, I was up in New England for a month. It's like, I don't want to track metrics</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">every day. I come and I go, right? Like this is all real talk. It's a useful tool. You're not running all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">the time. You're going to get it wrong. And it's something that you keep working on over time. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.980</a></span> | <span class="t">hopefully you have some sort of metric tracking going, but you're not being too hard on yourself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.860</a></span> | <span class="t">about getting it just right or having a Herculean collection of metrics that you're trying to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So there you go. People ask about metrics, I think. They don't always quite know what I'm talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you should probably explain what the time block planner is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=1022" target="_blank">00:17:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, if you don't know that, then I don't want to know you.

So you should check that out. There's a website as well with a video.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. If you've got a timeblockplanner.com, we filmed a nice video.

But what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=2246" target="_blank">00:37:26.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the saying? It must be Monday morning quarterbacking because, yeah, football used to be played primarily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=2251" target="_blank">00:37:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">on Sundays.

We need money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=2292" target="_blank">00:38:12.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, let's make sure that we're not like in financial trouble. And then let's step back and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=2295" target="_blank">00:38:15.820</a></span> | <span class="t">do some lifestyle centric planning. Here's the silver lining. There's a big change. What can you do in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=2299" target="_blank">00:38:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">changes? You can lean into it and change other things in a way that's good. Okay. There's a big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=2305" target="_blank">00:38:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">change situation.

I got to move to, you know, a really low cat, a teeny house that I own, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=2314" target="_blank">00:38:34.980</a></span> | <span class="t">in like the Oregon coast and like do this job remote that I already know about. It's not much money,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=2318" target="_blank">00:38:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but I won't need much money. And then I'm going to work on this and I'm going to be near my, my uncle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=2322" target="_blank">00:38:42.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's going to be whatever.

Like what it would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=2392" target="_blank">00:39:52.300</a></span> | <span class="t">roughly cost to get the materials. You would build it on a trailer. And like, the idea was, it was like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=2396" target="_blank">00:39:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of millennials who were like coming through their twenties and it was a hard job market because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=2401" target="_blank">00:40:01.900</a></span> | <span class="t">of the, the financial crisis.

Like professors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=2567" target="_blank">00:42:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">often think about slow September's like, is it possible?

So I'm going to start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=2576" target="_blank">00:42:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">prepping those classes slow and steady in August so that when I get to September, it's not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=2581" target="_blank">00:43:01.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh my God, I don't have a course website.

Like if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgnMHxzW_6k&t=2608" target="_blank">00:43:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">doing research, like, okay, that's like an October issue.
