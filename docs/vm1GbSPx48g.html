class="t">And it's one that our brain needs to make sense of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">in a multifaceted way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we all intuitively understand what pleasure and pain are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Pleasure generally is a sensation in the body and in the mind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that leads us to pursue more of whatever is bringing about that sensation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And pain is also a sensation in the body and in the mind that in general leads us to want to withdraw or move away from some activity or interaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Scientists would call this appetitive behaviors, meaning behaviors that lead us to create an appetite for more of those behaviors and aversive behaviors, behaviors that make us want to move away from something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The organ that we call the skin, as I mentioned earlier, the organ that we call the skin, as I mentioned earlier, is the largest organ in our body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And throughout that organ, we have neurons, little nerve cells now to be really technical about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way I'd like you to understand it is that the so-called cell body, meaning the location of a cell in which the DNA and other goodies, the kind of central factory of the cell that actually sits right outside your spinal cord.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So all up and down your spinal cord on either side are these little blobs of neurons, little collections of neurons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.740</a></span> | <span class="t">They're called DRGs, dorsal root ganglia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">A ganglion is just a collection or a clump of cells.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And those DRGs are really interesting because they send one branch that we call an axon, a little wire out to our skin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And they have another wire from that same cell body that goes in the opposite direction, which is up to our brain and creates connections within our brain in the so-called brainstem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.820</a></span> | <span class="t">These wires are positioned within the skin to respond to mechanical forces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe light touch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Some will only send electrical activity up toward the brain in response to light touch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Others respond to coarse pressure, to hard pressure, but they won't respond to a light feather.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Others respond to temperature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So they will respond to the presence of heat or the presence of cold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And still others respond to other types of stimuli, like certain chemicals on our skin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So these neurons are amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.940</a></span> | <span class="t">They're collecting information of particular kinds from the skin throughout the entire body and sending that information up toward the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's really incredible, I just want you to ponder this for a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.300</a></span> | <span class="t">What's really incredible is that the language that those neurons use is exactly the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">The neuron that responds to light touch sends electrical signals up toward the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.140</a></span> | <span class="t">The neurons that respond to cold or to heat or to habanero pepper, they only respond to the particular thing that evokes the electrical response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I should say that they only respond to the particular stimulus, the pepper, the cold, the heat, et cetera, that will evoke an electrical signal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But the electrical signals are a common language that all neurons use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet, if something cold is presented to your skin like an ice cube, you know that that sensation, that thing is cold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't misperceive it as cold, you don't misperceive it as heat or as a habanero pepper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">What that means is that there must be another element in the equation of what creates pleasure or pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And that element is your brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Your brain takes these electrical signals and interprets them partially based on experience, but also there are some innate, meaning some hardwired aspects of pain and pleasure sensing that require no experience whatsoever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">A child doesn't have to touch a flame, but once, and the very first time they will withdraw their hand from the flame.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.900</a></span> | <span class="t">The pain and pleasure system don't need prior experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">What they need is a brain that can interpret these electrical signals and somehow create what we call pleasure and pain out of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So what parts of the brain, well, mainly it's the so-called somatosensory cortex, the portion of our neocortex, which is on the outside of our brain, the kind of bumpy part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And in your somatosensory cortex, you have a map of your entire body surface.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">That map is called a homunculus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It's your representation of touch, including pleasure and pain, but it's not randomly organized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.460</a></span> | <span class="t">It's highly organized in a very particular way, which is that the areas of your skin that have the highest density of these sensory receptors are magnified in your brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">What are the areas that are magnified?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the lips, the face, the tips of the fingers, the feet, and the genitals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's because the innervation, the number of wires that go into those regions of your body far exceeds the number of wires for sensation of touch that go to other areas of your body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can actually experience this in real time right now by doing a simple experiment that we call two-point discrimination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Two-point discrimination is your ability to know whether or not two points of pressure are far apart, near each other, or you actually could perceive incorrectly as one point of pressure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You might want a second person to do this experiment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">That person would take two fine points, so it could be two pencils or pens or the backs of pens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">If you were to close your eyes and I were to take these two pens and put their points close together about a centimeter apart and present them to the top of your hand, you, even though your eyes were closed, you would be able to perceive that that was two points of pressure presented simultaneously to the top of your hand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">However, if I were to do this to the middle of your back, you would not experience them as two points of pressure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You would experience them as one single point of pressure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, your two-point discrimination is better, is higher on areas of your body, which have many, many more sensory receptors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.480</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">There are several things that can impact these experiences, but the main categories are expectation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If someone tells you

anxious or how high or low your level of arousal, autonomic arousal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">That's going to impact your experience of pleasure or pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.380</a></span> | <span class="t">How well you slept and where you are in the so-called circadian or 24-hour cycle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Our ability to tolerate pain changes dramatically across the 24-hour cycle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you can imagine, it's during the daylight waking hours that we are better able to tolerate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">We are more resilient to pain, and we are better able to experience pleasure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">At night, our threshold for pain is much lower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, the amount of mechanical or chemical or thermal, meaning temperature stimuli, that can evoke a pain response and how we would rate that response is much lower at night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And in particular, in the hours between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m., if you're on a kind of standard circadian schedule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the last one is our genes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Pain threshold and how long a pain response lasts is in part dictated by our genes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have expectation, anxiety, how well we've slept, where we are in the so-called 24-hour circadian time, and our genes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's talk about expectation and anxiety, because those two factors can powerfully modulate our experience of both pleasure and pain in ways that will allow us to dial up pleasure, if we like, and to dial down pain, if indeed that's what we want to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's talk about expectation and anxiety, because those two things are somewhat tethered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">There are now a number of solid experiments that point to the fact that if we know a painful stimulus is coming, that we can better prepare for it mentally, and therefore buffer or reduce the pain response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But essentially, if subjects are warned that a painful stimulus is coming, their subjective experience of that pain is vastly reduced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">However, if they are warned just two seconds before that pain arrives, it does not help.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It actually makes it worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason is they can't do anything mentally to prepare for it in that brief two-second window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Similarly, if they are warned about pain that's coming two minutes before a painful stimulus is coming, that also makes it worse, because their expectation ramps up the autonomic arousal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So how soon before a painful stimulus should we know about it if the goal is to reduce our level of pain?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And the answer is somewhere between 20 seconds and 40 seconds is about right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">This can come in useful in a variety of contexts, but I think it's important because what it illustrates is that it absolutely cannot be just the pattern of signals that are arriving from the skin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And there has to be a subjective interpretation component, because we are all different in terms of our pain threshold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, what is pain threshold?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Pain threshold has two dimensions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.460</a></span> | <span class="t">The first dimension is the amount of mechanical or chemical or thermal stimulation that it takes for you or me or somebody else to say, I can't take that anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's another element as well, which is how long the pain persists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And to just really point out how varied we all are in terms of our experience of pain, let's look to an experiment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">There have been experiments done at Stanford School of Medicine and elsewhere, which involved having subjects put their hand into a very cold vat of water and measuring the amount of time that they kept their hand in that water.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they would tell the experimenter how painful that particular stimulus was on a scale of one to 10.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.220</a></span> | <span class="t">That simple experiment revealed that people experience the same thermal, in this case, cold stimulus, vastly different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people would rate it as a 10 out of 10 extreme pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Other people would rate it as barely painful at all, like a one, other people a three, other people a five, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.060</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, there is no objective measure of pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Similarly, pleasure is something that we all talk about, but we have no way of gauging what other people are experiencing except what they report through language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So rather than focus on just the subjective nature of pain, let's talk about the absolute qualities of pain and the absolute qualities of pleasure so that we can learn how to navigate those two experiences in ways that serve us each better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, I want to talk about heat and cold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">We do indeed have sensors in our skin that respond to heat and cold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the best tests of how somebody can handle pain is to ask them to just get into an ice bath.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Some do it quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Some do it slowly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Others find the experience of cold to be so aversive that they somehow cannot get themselves in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it can be helpful to everyone to know that even though it feels better at a mental level to get into the cold slowly, it is actually much worse from a neurobiological perspective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The neurons that sense cold respond to what are called relative drops in temperature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not about the absolute temperature of the water.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's about the relative change in temperature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Therefore, you can bypass these signals going up to the brain with each relative change, one degree change, two degrees change, et cetera, by simply getting in all at once.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, it is true that if you get into cold water up to your neck, it's actually much more comfortable than if you're halfway in and halfway out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=857" target="_blank">00:14:17.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's because of the difference in the signals that are being sent from the cold receptors on your upper torso, which is out of the water in your lower torso.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I wouldn't want anyone to take this to mean that they should just jump into an unknown body of water.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">People can have heart attacks from getting into extremely cold water.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But it is absolutely true that provided it's safe, getting into a cold water is always going to be easier to do quickly and is going to be easier to do up to your neck.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, heat is the opposite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Heat is measured in absolute terms by the neurons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So gradually moving into heat makes sense and finding that threshold, which is safe and comfortable for you, or if it's uncomfortable, at least resides within that realm of safety.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the most important things to understand about the experience of pain and to really illustrate just how subjective pain really is, is that our experience of pain and the degree of damage to our body are not always correlated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=914"

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">They took him to the hospital and because the nail was so long and because of where it had entered and exited the boot, they had to cut away the boot in order to get to the nail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And when they did that, they revealed that the nail had passed between two of his toes, it had actually failed to impale his body in any way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet the view, the perception of that nail entering his boot at one end and exiting the boot at the other was sufficient to create the experience of a nail that had gone through his foot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And the moment he realized that that nail had not gone through his foot, the pain completely evaporated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want to make sure that I emphasize the so-called psychosomatic phenomenon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I think sometimes we hear psychosomatic and we interpret that as meaning all in one's head, but I think it's important to remember that everything is neural, whether or not it's pain in your body because you have a gaping wound and you're hemorrhaging out of that wound,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">or whether or not it's pain for which you cannot explain it on the basis of any kind of injury, it's all neural.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1005" target="_blank">00:16:45.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So saying body, brain, or psychosomatic, it's kind of irrelevant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And I hope someday we move past that language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we hear syndrome and a patient comes into a clinic and says that they suffer, for instance, from something which is very controversial, frankly, like chronic fatigue syndrome,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">some physicians believe that it reflects a real underlying medical condition, others don't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">However, syndrome means we don't understand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And that doesn't mean something doesn't exist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Fibromyalgia or whole body pain for a long time was written off or kind of explained away by physicians and scientists, frankly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">my community as one of these syndromes, it couldn't be explained.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">However, now there is firm understanding of at least one of the bases for this whole body pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's activation of a particular cell type called glia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a receptor on these glia, for those of you that want to know, called the TOL4 receptor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And activation of the TOL4 receptor is related to certain forms of whole body pain and fibromyalgia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, what treatments exist for fibromyalgia?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.820</a></span> | <span class="t">There are clinical data using a prescription drug.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The drug is called naltrexone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Naltrexone is actually used for the treatment of various opioid addictions and things of that sort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But it turns out that a very low dose has been shown to have some success in dealing with and treating certain forms of fibromyalgia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And it has that success because of its ability to bind to and block these TOL4 receptors on glia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">There's another approach that one could take.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And that compound is acetyl L-carnitine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1113" target="_blank">00:18:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">There is evidence that acetyl L-carnitine can reduce the symptoms of chronic whole body pain and other certain forms of acute pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">at dosages of somewhere between one to three and sometimes four grams per day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1127" target="_blank">00:18:47.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, acetyl L-carnitine can be taken orally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1131" target="_blank">00:18:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It's found in 500 milligram capsules, as well as by injection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1135" target="_blank">00:18:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a large number of studies on acetyl L-carnitine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">You can look those up on PubMed, if you like, or on examine.com.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So it appears that L-carnitine is impacting a number of different processes, both to impact pain and perhaps,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1149" target="_blank">00:19:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and I want to underscore perhaps, but there are good studies happening now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">perhaps accelerate wound healing as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1156" target="_blank">00:19:16.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I'd like to turn our attention to a completely non-drug, non-supplement related approach to dealing with pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's one that has existed for thousands of years and that only recently has the Western scientific community started to pay serious attention to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And there is terrific mechanistic science to now explain how and why acupuncture can work very well for the treatment of certain forms of pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I want to tell you what was told to me by our director or chief of the pain division at Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Sean Mackey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">which was that a fraction of a doctorate, which was that a fraction of people experienced tremendous pain relief from acupuncture and others experienced none at all or very little.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">A number of laboratories have started to explore how acupuncture works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the premier laboratories for this is Chu Fu Ma's lab at Harvard Medical School.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the form of acupuncture that they explored was one that's commonly in use called electroacupuncture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So this isn't just putting little needles into different parts of the body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.060</a></span> | <span class="t">These needles are able to pass an electrical current, not magically, but because they have a little wire going back to a device and you can pass electrical current.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So what Chu Fu Ma's lab found was that if electroacupuncture is provided to the abdomen, to the stomach area, it creates activation of what are called the sympathetic ganglia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And the activation of these neurons involves noradrenaline and something called NPY, neuropeptide Y.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The long and short of it is that stimulating the abdomen with electroacupuncture was either anti-inflammatory,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1261" target="_blank">00:21:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">or it could cause inflammation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1264" target="_blank">00:21:04.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It could actually exacerbate inflammation, depending on whether or not it was of low or high intensity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1269" target="_blank">00:21:09.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that makes it a very precarious technique.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1272" target="_blank">00:21:12.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And this may speak to some of the reason why some people report relief from acupuncture and others do not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1278" target="_blank">00:21:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">However, they went a step further and stimulated other areas of the body using electroacupuncture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And what they found is that stimulation of the legs caused a circuit, a neural circuit to be activated,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1290" target="_blank">00:21:30.340</a></span> | <span class="t">that goes from the legs up to an area of the base of the brain called the DMV and activated the adrenal glands,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1299" target="_blank">00:21:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">which sit atop your kidneys and cause the release of what are called catecholamines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1305" target="_blank">00:21:45.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And those were strongly anti-inflammatory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, electroacupuncture of the legs and feet can, if done correctly, be anti-inflammatory and reduce symptoms of pain and perhaps accelerate wound healing because activations of these catecholaminergic pathways can accelerate wound healing as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, let's talk about a phenomenon that has long intrigued and perplexed people for probably thousands of years, and that's redheads.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1335" target="_blank">00:22:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You may have heard before that redheads have a higher pain threshold than other individuals, and indeed, that is true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1343" target="_blank">00:22:23.060</a></span> | <span class="t">There's now a study that looked at this mechanistically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1346" target="_blank">00:22:26.520</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a gene called the MC1R gene, and this MC1R gene encodes for a number of different proteins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1356" target="_blank">00:22:36.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of those proteins, of course, are related to the production of melanin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1360" target="_blank">00:22:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">This is why redheads often, not always, but often are very fair-skinned, sometimes have freckles, not always, and, of course, have red hair.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">This gene, this MC1R gene, is associated with a pathway that relates to something that I've talked about on this podcast before during the episode on hunger and feeding,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and this is POMC, POMC stands for pro-opio-melanocortin, and POMC is cut up, it's cleaved into different hormones,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1392" target="_blank">00:23:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">including one that enhances pain perception.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1395" target="_blank">00:23:15.020</a></span> | <span class="t">This is melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and another one that blocks pain, beta-endorphin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1401" target="_blank">00:23:21.460</a></span> | <span class="t">The endorphins are endogenously made, meaning made within our body, opioids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">They actually make us feel numb in response to certain kinds of pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, not completely numb, but they numb or reduce our perception of pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1417" target="_blank">00:23:37.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We all have beta-endorphins, we all have POMC, etc., but redheads make more of these endogenous endorphins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this, of course, should not be taken to mean that redheads can tolerate more pain and, therefore, should be subjected to more pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.660</a></span> | <span class="t">All it means is that their threshold for pain on average, not all of them, but on average, is shifted higher than that of other individuals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1441" target="_blank">00:24:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And I should mention, because I mentioned the ice bath, that, of course, pain threshold is something that can be built up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">but it does seem that certain patterns of thinking can allow us to buffer ourselves against the pain response,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1453" target="_blank">00:24:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and that should not be surprising.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1456" target="_blank">00:24:16.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Certain forms of thinking are associated with the release of particular neuromodulators, in particular dopamine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And dopamine, it may seem, is kind of the thing that underlies everything, but it's not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1468" target="_blank">00:24:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Dopamine is a molecule that's associated with novelty, expectation, motivation, and reward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1474" target="_blank">00:24:34.220</a></span> | <span class="t">We talked about this at the beginning of the episode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1476" target="_blank">00:24:36.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And the ways in which dopamine can modulate pain is not mysterious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1480" target="_blank">00:24:40.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really through the activation of brainstem neurons that communicate with areas of our body that deploy things like immune cells.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1489" target="_blank">00:24:49.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for instance, we have neurons in our brainstem that can be modulated by the release of dopamine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1495" target="_blank">00:24:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">and those neurons in the brainstem control the release of immune cells from tissues like the spleen or organs like the spleen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And those immune cells can then go combat infection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1506" target="_blank">00:25:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We've heard before that when we're happy, we're better able to combat infection, deal with pain, deal with all sorts of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1513" target="_blank">00:25:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It essentially makes us more resilient because dopamine affects particular circuits and tells, in a very neurobiological way, in a biochemical way, tells those cells and circuits that conditions are good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1525" target="_blank">00:25:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And it really does allow for more resilience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1527" target="_blank">00:25:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So along those lines, let's talk about pleasure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1529" target="_blank">00:25:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">With all the cells and tissues and machinery related to pain, you might think that our entire touch system is designed to allow us to detect pain and to avoid tissue damage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1540" target="_blank">00:25:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And while a good percentage of it is devoted to that, a good percentage of it is also devoted to this thing that we call pleasure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1548" target="_blank">00:25:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And that should come as no surprise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1551" target="_blank">00:25:51.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Pleasure serves an adaptive role.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1553" target="_blank">00:25:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And that adaptive role relates to the fact that every species has a primary goal, which is to make more of itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1559" target="_blank">00:25:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Otherwise, it would go extinct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.300</a></span> | <span class="t">That process of making more of itself, sexual reproduction, is closely associated with the sensation and the perception of pleasure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1570" target="_blank">00:26:10.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's no surprise that not only is the highest density of sensory receptors in and on and around the genitalia, but the process of reproduction evokes sensations and molecules and perceptions associated with pleasure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1587" target="_blank">00:26:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And the currency of pleasure exists in multiple chemical systems, but the primary ones are the dopamine system, which is the anticipation of pleasure and the work required to achieve the ability to experience that pleasure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1604" target="_blank">00:26:44.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And from dopamine and serotonin stem out other hormones and molecules, things like oxytocin, which are associated with pair bonding, oxytocin is more closely associated with the serotonin system biochemically and at the circuit level, meaning the areas of the brain and body that manufacture a lot of serotonin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1629" target="_blank">00:27:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Usually, usually not always, but usually contain neurons that also manufacture and make use of the molecule oxytocin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1635" target="_blank">00:27:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Those chemicals together create sensations of warmth, of well-being, of safety.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1643" target="_blank">00:27:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The dopamine molecule is more closely associated with hormones like testosterone and other molecules involved with pursuit and further effort in order to get more of whatever could potentially cause more release of dopamine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1658" target="_blank">00:27:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So if levels of serotonin and dopamine are too low, it becomes almost impossible to experience pleasure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1668" target="_blank">00:27:48.060</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a so-called ahedonia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1670" target="_blank">00:27:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This is also described as depression, although it needn't be long-term depression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1675" target="_blank">00:27:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So certain drugs like antidepressants, like Welbutrin, Bupryorone, as it's commonly called, or the so-called SSRIs, the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1688" target="_blank">00:28:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">excuse me, like Prozac, Oloft, and similar, will increase dopamine and serotonin, respectively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1694" target="_blank">00:28:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">They're not increasing the peaks in those molecules.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1698" target="_blank">00:28:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">The, what we call the acute release of those molecules.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1701" target="_blank">00:28:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">What they're doing is they're raising the overall levels of those molecules.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1704" target="_blank">00:28:24.340</a></span> | <span class="t">They're raising the sort of foundation or the tide, if you will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1708" target="_blank">00:28:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Think about it as your mood or your pleasure, rather, is like a boat, and if it's on the shore and it can't get out to sea unless that tide is high enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1716" target="_blank">00:28:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">That's kind of the way to think about these tonic levels of dopamine and serotonin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1719" target="_blank">00:28:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, most of us, fortunately, do not have problems with our baseline or our tonic levels of dopamine and serotonin release.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1727" target="_blank">00:28:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The brain and body use these common currencies for different experiences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1732" target="_blank">00:28:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yes, if your dopamine and serotonin, or I should say if your dopamine and or serotonin levels are too low,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1738" target="_blank">00:28:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it will be very hard to achieve pleasure, to experience physical pleasure or emotional pleasure of any kind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1745" target="_blank">00:29:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why treatments of the sort that I described a minute ago might be right for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1750" target="_blank">00:29:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, we can't determine if they're right for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1752" target="_blank">00:29:12.460</a></span> | <span class="t">It's also why they have side effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1753" target="_blank">00:29:13.860</a></span> | <span class="t">If you artificially increase these molecules that are associated with pleasure, oftentimes you get a lack of motivation to go seek things like food.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1762" target="_blank">00:29:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">People don't get much interest in food because why should they if their serotonin levels are already up?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1766" target="_blank">00:29:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, there's a ton of individual variation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1769" target="_blank">00:29:29.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't want to say that these antidepressants are always bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1773" target="_blank">00:29:33.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes they've saved lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1775" target="_blank">00:29:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">They've saved millions of lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1776" target="_blank">00:29:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes people have side effects that make them not the right choice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1779" target="_blank">00:29:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So it has to be determined for the individual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1781" target="_blank">00:29:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Just briefly, because it's relevant to the conversation that we've been having, you might want to be wary of any experience, any experience, no matter how it arrives, chemical, physical, emotional, or some combination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1796" target="_blank">00:29:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You might want to be aware of, you might want to be, you might want to be wary of letting your dopamine go too high.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1800" target="_blank">00:30:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And certainly you want to be wary of it going too low because of the way that these circuits adjust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1804" target="_blank">00:30:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically every time that the pleasure system is kicked in high gear, an absolutely spectacular event, you cannot be more ecstatic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1814" target="_blank">00:30:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a mirror symmetric activation of the pain system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1819" target="_blank">00:30:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And this might seem like an evil curse of biology, but it's not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1824" target="_blank">00:30:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">This is actually a way to protect this whole system of reward and motivation that I talked about at the beginning of the episode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1831" target="_blank">00:30:31.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It might sound great to just ingest substances or engage in behaviors where it's just dopamine, dopamine, dopamine, and just constantly be motivated, but the system will eventually crash.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1841" target="_blank">00:30:41.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what happens is when you have a big increase in dopamine, you also will get a big increase in the circuits that underlie our sense of disappointment and readjusting the balance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1852" target="_blank">00:30:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And with repeated exposure to high levels of dopamine, not naturally occurring, wonderful events, but really high chemically induced peaks in dopamine, high magnitude, chemically induced peaks in dopamine, what happens is those peaks in dopamine start to go down and down and down in response to the same, what ought to be incredible experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1875" target="_blank">00:31:15.820</a></span> | <span class="t">We start to what's called habituate or attenuate, and yet the pain increases in size.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1883" target="_blank">00:31:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And this has a preservative function in keeping us safe, believe it or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1888" target="_blank">00:31:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But what I just described is actually the basis of most, if not all forms of addiction, something that we will deal with in a future episode in depth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1897" target="_blank">00:31:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So today we talked about the pathways in the skin and in the brain and elsewhere in the body that control our sense of pleasure and pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1904" target="_blank">00:31:44.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And we described a number of different tools ranging from different supplements to electroacupuncture and various other tools that one could use to modulate your sense of pleasure or pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1915" target="_blank">00:31:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, in thinking about pleasure, we have to think about the dopamine system and the serotonin system and some of the related chemical systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1922" target="_blank">00:32:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I realized that today's podcast had a lot of scientific details.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1925" target="_blank">00:32:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't expect that everyone would be able to understand all these details all at once.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1930" target="_blank">00:32:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">What's more important really is to understand the general principles of how something like pleasure and pain work, how they interact, and the various cells and systems within the brain and body that allow them to occur and that modulate or change their ability to occur.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1945" target="_blank">00:32:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, your subjective experience of pleasure or pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1949" target="_blank">00:32:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I do hope that this was, on whole, more pleasureful than painful for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1954" target="_blank">00:32:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And last but not least, I thank you for your time and attention, and thank you for your interest in science.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1GbSPx48g&t=1959"
