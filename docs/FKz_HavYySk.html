href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKz_HavYySk&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">now or something like that yeah so so it's really strange we we have the feel of a small family church</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKz_HavYySk&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">close-knit
