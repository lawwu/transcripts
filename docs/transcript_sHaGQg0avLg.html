Yeah, is there intelligence out there that's underlies the whole thing? You can call them with the G word if you want. I can say, are we a computer simulation with a purpose? Is there an agent, an intelligent agent, that underlies or is responsible for the whole thing?</p><p>Does that intelligent agent satisfy the laws of physics? Does it satisfy the laws of quantum mechanics? Is it made of atoms and molecules? Yeah, there's a lot of questions. And I don't see... it seems to me a real question. It's an answerable question. Well, I don't know if it's answerable.</p><p>The questions have to be answerable to be real. Some philosophers would say that a question is not a question unless it's answerable. This question doesn't seem to me answerable by any known method, but it seems to me real.</p></div></div></body></html>
