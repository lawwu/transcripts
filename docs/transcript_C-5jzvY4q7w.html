What you eat, exercise, your sleep, and how you manage stress. And then I would sort of add your nutritional support through nutritional supplements that are foundational. If you get those things right, 80% of the time you're gonna deal with most of the stuff you have going on.</p><p>So start with doing a fridge biopsy. If you pick up something and it has a label and you don't recognize the ingredients, throw it away. Start just choosing real food. And it doesn't have to be expensive. You can go to Costco, you can go to Walmart, you can go to the big box stores.</p><p>Second is, you know, move your body. Everybody needs to take a walk for 30 minutes a day. Do some simple resistance training. It can be your body weight. There's tons of things on YouTube and online to learn from. You don't need a lot of equipment and it's important to stay fit.</p><p>Next is optimize your sleep. And it requires you to understand what that means. And there's a great book by Matthew Walker called "Why We Sleep." And then of course, managing stress. How do you deal with that? And it's individual. Some people like to do breath work or meditation or guided imagery or they use sound healing or binaural beads.</p><p>Everybody needs to figure out how to regulate their nervous system. and most of us never learn how to do that.</p></div></div></body></html>
