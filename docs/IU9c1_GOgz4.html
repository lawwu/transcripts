Here's the passage that piles up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">more designations of Satan than any other passage in the Bible.

It would be Revelation 12, 9 and 10. Here it says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">"And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent"—and remember what the Bible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">said in Genesis 3 about him, he's subtler, he's subtler than every beast, so it's his subtlety</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that's being focused on in his serpent-like reality—"who is called the devil, diabolo,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">slanderer, liar, cheat, and Satan, adversary, the deceiver of the whole world." I don't think you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">can say anything more sweeping or more basic than the end of Revelation 12, 9, "He is the deceiver</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of the whole world." Verse 10, "The accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">day and night before God." So at the center of Satan's purpose is to deceive on earth and to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">accuse in heaven. If he can deceive you about God and Christ, you will perish. If he can successfully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">accuse you of unforgiven sin in heaven, you will perish. And Jesus calls him a murderer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">from the beginning, John 8, 44. So the deception and the accusation and the eternal death that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">results from unforgiven sin is a way of destroying people and opposing God. So Josh asks me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">"To what extent and by what means specifically does Satan influence the world?" My answer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">therefore, is the extent is worldwide, and the means is deception. We can see this in another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">text. Here's Revelation 28-10. He comes out to deceive the nations, but he will be defeated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">"And the devil who had deceived them." So there's the focus again on his major strategy of destroying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the world. Deceive them, and he will be thrown into the lake of fire. So my basic answer to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Josh's question is that the extent of Satan's influence is global, covers all nations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and the primary means of his influence is deception. He destroys, not mainly by the sword</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">or disease or killing, but mainly by lying. Jesus calls him the father of lies, John 8, 44.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Specifically, he lies mainly about God, about Jesus, about the gospel, about sin, and oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">how wonderful it is that he has been dealt a decisive blow. You can see his deception about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the gospel in 2 Corinthians 4, 4. In the case of the God of this world, he has blinded the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">minds of unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">who is the image of God. So Josh's second question is, where do you see his works most clearly?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And my answer is, therefore, wherever saving truth is hated and resisted and distorted and muted,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">so that people are kept from being saved by the truth of the gospel, that's where I see his works</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">most clearly. 2 Thessalonians 2, 9, Satan comes with wicked deception for those who are perishing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">because they refuse to love the truth and so be saved. Satan hates the truth of the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And the truth of the cross more than any other truth. You remember when Jesus was on earth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Satan tried to keep him away from the cross? Matthew 16, 23, when Peter says, "No, no,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this isn't going to happen to you." Jesus says, "Get behind me, Satan. That's what Satan wants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">He doesn't want me to die for the sins of the world." Even though at the end,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Satan gave up on that strategy and filled Judas to get Jesus betrayed, nevertheless, at the end,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">he's trying to make it as horrible as possible. But his first design was, "I'm not going to let</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">him get to the cross, no way." And now, Satan is mainly bent on preventing the message of the cross</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">from being spread, from being understood, from being believed. And he does everything in his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">power to distort and silence the saving message of the cross. Remember how Jesus said he snatches</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the word. He snatches it. Just as soon as you preach the cross, as soon as you preach the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">saving word of the kingdom, boy, Satan will, if he can, snatch the word right out of the mind,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9c1_GOgz4&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">just like birds snatching seed off of a path.
