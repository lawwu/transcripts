We get a ton of questions from people on YouTube and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">our inbox.

So great question. So let's get in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So remember, our email here is askthecompoundshow@gmail.com if you have a question for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's do one. - Okay. First up today, we have, "Technology has made investing easier with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">indexing, direct indexing, robo-advisors, etc. With AI in vogue right now, what does the RIA</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and financial planning space look like in another 20 to 30 years?

I love this question. There were similar questions asked when robo-advisors came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">out. It was kind of like, "Is financial advisor still necessary here?" And AI is not robo-advisors,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">right? This is a whole other thing. Obviously, no one knows how AI will transform our lives,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but speculation is just running rampant now because of all the chat GPT stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">The possibilities seem endless. There's tons of speculation from people. I think this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the fun stage of innovation where people just spend all their time thinking what the future</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">could look like. I do think this is one of the first major technological breakthroughs where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">people can see it immediately. The first time they try it, they say, "Oh, I get it. This makes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">sense. I've done a few demos on some of this stuff, on some ideas and startups, and it makes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">sense." So even though we don't know exactly how it's going to change our lives, how the businesses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">will use it, I think we can be sure that it's going to evolve from here. I'm going to skip over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the Terminator end of days stuff, right? Because I don't know. That's a pretty easy one to figure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">out what the end game is. So I'm going to focus on how this could change the financial advice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">realm going forward. I do agree with you, by the way, though, just for the record,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">from what you were saying on Animal Spirits yesterday. I think that the negative that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">going to come from AI is very easily or likely going to outweigh the positive if we're not careful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Unfortunately, there's going to be some wonderful things that come from it, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">especially for knowledge workers like us. Content clips, and there's going to be so many different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">things you can do, and we're going to look at one of those right now. I do think the downsides</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">could be pretty drastic and scams, and I think it's just another tool of a tool belt for people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">who want to take advantage of others. So one of our loyal viewers, I don't know if he's in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">chat today, Part-Time Larry, which is just a, it kind of sounds like a comedian's name, maybe? Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, I'm going to see Part-Time Larry tonight." He has a YouTube channel, and it's called OpenAI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">for Finance that's looking into some of the ideas here. He created this video, and he didn't even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">send it to us. Someone else sent it to us, and he used chat GPT to essentially create a portfolio</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">rescue question and answer engine that just blew me away. Maybe we'll try to put a link in this in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the show notes. Yeah, we'll wing to it. So he took all of the questions that we've been answered,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">he uploaded them somehow, and he created this financial advice box, basically, where you ask</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a question, and it would spit out an answer based on how we've answered questions here in the past.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's essentially a portfolio rescue AI. And the whole thing that he... I didn't get all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">technical aspects of what he was explaining, but it did kind of blow me away. And we're still in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the early innings of this stuff here, right? This stuff is only going to get better and more useful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and I was blown away by the stuff he could do when we're still in like the first inning of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff. So I love the idea of having an archive of my blog or any of the podcasts and giving people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the ability to search seamlessly for charts and graphs and data and answer and context and even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">movie recommendations. So if Larry's listening, my next AI request for him would be, people always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">ask us for Animal Spirits, "Do you have a list of all your movie and TV show recommendations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">somewhere?" No, that'd be way too hard for us and too much of a pain in the butt. But if AI could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">do it, that'd be great. All of Michael's horrible movie recommendations and my wonderful TV movie</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">recommendations. So maybe AI can help there too. So the question is, will everyone have their own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">AI financial advisor someday that executes a financial plan on their behalf? It wouldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">surprise me if something like that existed someday. It certainly makes a lot of sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Do we need John Connor to go back in time to save financial advisors and kill this technology</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">before it gets off the ground? I would actually go the other way here. I think if AI lives up to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">its promise, I think it's just going to be a commodity that everyone has access to. And that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">only increases the value of human advice, right? So Howard Lindzen, friend of the show, likes to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">say that there's no such thing as information overload, only filter failure. And I think if AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">ends up becoming this subtotal of human knowledge on the internet that has this interactive format,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">then the best advisors are going to be the ones that were able to filter out the best uses of it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">make their lives more efficient and make things, make tools better for their clients to use it in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">concert with that technology. So I think it's like a compliment to good advisors. So I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that's always been the case, advisors who are able to use the newest technology. So the thing about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">financial advice is there is no black or white or right or wrong for most of the big decisions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62Pd74XYdI&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">right?
