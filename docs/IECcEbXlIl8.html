Also, just an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">easy way to get started on development. Now, I started writing a mini rant about the whole,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, what it means for a scripting language to be adequate, which I haven't published</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">yet.

So what do we mean when we talk about scripting? Often</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.860</a></span> | <span class="t">we mean file manipulation, some text manipulation, and some process manipulation, like launch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">this process, launch that process, move these files around. This is what Bash is really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">good for. >> I don't know if you mentioned it, but a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.900</a></span> | <span class="t">bit of network stuff, probably like grabbing something --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Perling stuff or pulling stuff down and then doing things with it. So that's sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">of the domain of scripting and where some languages, you know, might be really good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.940</a></span> | <span class="t">in a general way, like I'm fond of Swift, they often fall down on scripting because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.740</a></span> | <span class="t">some of their APIs are very verbose for these routine operations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.140</a></span> | <span class="t">>> And ideally, deployment would be attach it to an email and send it to somebody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Yes, yes.

And the way it works is--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I remember that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. It's a brilliantly tasteful little piece of engineering. Swift is nice. You can write</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.540</a></span> | <span class="t">a single file script in Swift. But then Swift is crappy because you have a bunch of dependencies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to have a package file. You need to have a directory. You need to name them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.380</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a whole separate operation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But with his thing, instead of having your shebang line in your normal Swift script be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">this, you just change it to Swift sh. And then you write Swift as usual, except you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">add special comments that come after the normal Swift import statements. So this comment says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.260</a></span> | <span class="t">that the Promise Git library can actually be got from the GitHub account associated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">with Max Howell. And this script needs a version 6.5 or greater. And you can get more involved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">with it if you want. You can have fairly elaborate statements of version dependencies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this way, you can write a single file script that actually can have half a dozen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">external dependencies with pinned versions if you want. And when you run the script,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it will just work. It'll do all the compiling somewhere else you don't see it. And you just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=926" target="_blank">00:15:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">have the magic of, I give someone a single file. And as long as they have this Swift</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">shell malarkey installed, then they can just run that file. And the first time they run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it, it takes a while because it's fetching all this stuff and it's compiling. But then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the second time, it just runs because you have an actually efficient compiled executable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's quite nice. I quite like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Then the Rust folks never miss a beat these days. There's a similar thing in Rust called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Rust Script. And it's exactly the same idea. You need to install Rust Script. That's actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">not so great to install. You've got to go and install it with an installer. It's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">just a binary you put in a magic place. But then once you do, it's the same gimmick or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.260</a></span> | <span class="t">the same act of genius. You just replace your shebang with Rust Script. And then you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.460</a></span> | <span class="t">this comment block that comes right after Rust Script that states your Rust dependencies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.700</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, I need time version 0.1.2.5. And then once you've done that, you've magically created</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a single file using Rust that can exploit the whole Rust dependency ecosystem and is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">dead easy to run.

You just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.060</a></span> | <span class="t">give someone the file and they don't need to learn about Rust. They just do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I wrote a C# version of this about 20 years ago, which was great. That's in my insurance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.020</a></span> | <span class="t">pricing company.

So it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">a reasonable size again, Jeremy, in terms of legibility? Yeah. Because the Python packaging</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and distribution story, in my opinion, is terrible. Maybe it's great if you really know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.460</a></span> | <span class="t">your way around it. But it takes a while to realize all the different things that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">out there and which ones are redundant and which ones are official and which ones are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">good and which ones are bad. And every time I step away from the language for years and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.260</a></span> | <span class="t">come back, I feel like I need to recheck to see if things are-- what the situation is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1098" target="_blank">00:18:18.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And my understanding of the current situation is that there's two things that work and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.300</a></span> | <span class="t">are all you need.

And you probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">should because Venv and Pip come built in.

And that's not enough. Because if you are doing interesting machine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.940</a></span> | <span class="t">learning stuff, for example, or things that have parts of the data science stack, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.340</a></span> | <span class="t">fact is not all of that can be packaged with Venv. And people who think so usually think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.340</a></span> | <span class="t">so because they just haven't had to use those dependencies. So they haven't run into those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">cases yet. But when you hit those cases, then the answer is Conda. You don't need to like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.140</a></span> | <span class="t">it, but that seems to be the truth. So my current--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1155" target="_blank">00:19:15.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not bad. It's not bad advice. For what it's worth, I would say, actually, you should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.740</a></span> | <span class="t">use Miniconda regardless. On Windows, if you run Python on a new Windows box, it's a wrapper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1177" target="_blank">00:19:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">which basically points you to something that lets you install it. Like it's not already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1181" target="_blank">00:19:41.220</a></span> | <span class="t">there at all. On Mac, if you run Python, you're running the system Python, which Apple strongly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">asks everybody not to use for anything other than letting them run system stuff. And on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Linux, it's pretty likely you've got a really old Python, you know, if you're using Ubuntu.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1201" target="_blank">00:20:01.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So I would tell people just use Miniconda. That way, you've got your own Python, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.780</a></span> | <span class="t">you can still use Venv if you want to. But, you know, now it's just like one solution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.300</a></span> | <span class="t">for everybody. So just use Miniconda and just use environments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I've only ever used Miniconda.

I think your knowledge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1225" target="_blank">00:20:25.100</a></span> | <span class="t">of this is much better than mine. So everyone, you should listen to Jeremy's advice. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1230" target="_blank">00:20:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">if you have an allergy to Conda, and you know you don't need the data science stack, then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1235" target="_blank">00:20:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">it's my understanding that you can get by with just pip and VM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1238" target="_blank">00:20:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You probably can get by.

You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1335" target="_blank">00:22:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">can just use VM in all situations except the one that Alexis mentioned, which is you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1341" target="_blank">00:22:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">more complicated binary things to install, like a compiler framework or compiler toolkit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1352" target="_blank">00:22:32.220</a></span> | <span class="t">or CUDA or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1357" target="_blank">00:22:37.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

So the point you're making, Jeremy, is that if you create a Conda environment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.460</a></span> | <span class="t">once you're within the Conda environment, then you can then run Conda install, and you'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1381" target="_blank">00:23:01.820</a></span> | <span class="t">be installing packages that are Conda packages managed through Conda's distribution repos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1387" target="_blank">00:23:07.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But once you're in the Conda environment, you can also just run PIP install and install--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1391" target="_blank">00:23:11.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And you don't even need to be in a Conda environment.

Because at any given point, Apple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1437" target="_blank">00:23:57.820</a></span> | <span class="t">might decide to upgrade it, change things around, and you don't want to be destabilizing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1442" target="_blank">00:24:02.540</a></span> | <span class="t">your system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1443" target="_blank">00:24:03.540</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So here's how this will work. I've got a couple test scripts here that I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1450" target="_blank">00:24:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">using to test it out. So I'll show some of the cases. So very simple example would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1460" target="_blank">00:24:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">one where you have a script and it has no dependencies at all. Here's a very boring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1472" target="_blank">00:24:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">script. And here you can see the shebang is something I'm now calling VM script. But I'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1480" target="_blank">00:24:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">change that. I can change that now to --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1482" target="_blank">00:24:42.020</a></span> | <span class="t">>> I'm just going to tell people what /usr/bin/env is, because a lot of people are confused about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1488" target="_blank">00:24:48.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that. So you don't have to use that. It's just a thing which, I don't know, it's kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1495" target="_blank">00:24:55.140</a></span> | <span class="t">of a best -- I guess, you know, it's trying to find the correct place to find that from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1501" target="_blank">00:25:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">You could avoid that and just directly write the full path of your combo script, too, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1508" target="_blank">00:25:08.460</a></span> | <span class="t">you wish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">>> Yeah. All right. So the script I wrote, the latest version of it, is now -- this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1517" target="_blank">00:25:17.740</a></span> | <span class="t">the part that needs cleaning up. This one right here. And what it will do is when it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1529" target="_blank">00:25:29.980</a></span> | <span class="t">reads a script, it will parse a script looking for a dependency block. A dependency block</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1543" target="_blank">00:25:43.980</a></span> | <span class="t">is a formatted set of comments which may specify conda commands to run in a new conda environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1559" target="_blank">00:25:59.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And may specify the exact text of a requirements.txt file which will be pip installed, either in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1578" target="_blank">00:26:18.900</a></span> | <span class="t">the conda environment or else in a VM. So, for example, I've got my test scripts here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1591" target="_blank">00:26:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like I've let everyone into my house before I cleaned up.

The conda part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1608" target="_blank">00:26:48.700</a></span> | <span class="t">of the blocks always starts with a header which is conda commands.source. Because if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1613" target="_blank">00:26:53.940</a></span> | <span class="t">you were actually in a conda environment, you would source those commands in order to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.700</a></span> | <span class="t">do your installations. And then the things that you might only want to pip install are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1624" target="_blank">00:27:04.980</a></span> | <span class="t">in here, introduced with a header, requirements.txt. And this text here in the lines under requirements.txt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1632" target="_blank">00:27:12.140</a></span> | <span class="t">will literally be the text of a requirements.txt file that's used. And then Python 3 m pip install</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1640" target="_blank">00:27:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">-r requirements.txt will be run to install that. So, with this script, for instance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1647" target="_blank">00:27:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">if we run it, and let me put this in the - put my thing in the path here. All right. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1677" target="_blank">00:27:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the one I was looking at was test script conda requirements. Make sure my latest version</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1682" target="_blank">00:28:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">is in the path. Yes, it is. Move this chunk out of the way. So, I'm invoking it now by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1693" target="_blank">00:28:13.780</a></span> | <span class="t">calling the script.

This line in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1717" target="_blank">00:28:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">beginning is what tells the operating system what interpreter to use to run the file.

So, if I just run the script, conva script</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1737" target="_blank">00:28:57.100</a></span> | <span class="t">2, sorry, I run test script, conda and requirements, then the operating system will read this line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1748" target="_blank">00:29:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It'll say, okay, I got to go find this thing in the environment. Because I put it in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1753" target="_blank">00:29:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">path, it will be in the environment.

And when I do that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1766" target="_blank">00:29:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I've got it doing - well, there it ran very quickly, because I'd already cached the building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1772" target="_blank">00:29:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that it did.

But let's get - we can go look at those cache things, erase them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1802" target="_blank">00:30:02.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and then see it do the thing of figuring out what to do the first time. That's much noisier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1808" target="_blank">00:30:08.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I'm calling it VN script cache, but I'll erase the cached environments now. And those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1823" target="_blank">00:30:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">caches - those alphanumeric blobs were MD5 hashes that were based on the dependency block.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1831" target="_blank">00:30:31.060</a></span> | <span class="t">>> So, there's no fanciness, like I know some systems will - oh, you know, if you only changed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1839" target="_blank">00:30:39.540</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the pip requirements, there's no reason to, like, create a whole new conda environment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IECcEbXlIl8&t=1843" target="_blank">00:30:43.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and download PyTorch again and all of that.
