I want to mention that Zach sent me some running shoes from Ultra which I think is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=41">00:00:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a company that sponsors him. When I put those shoes on I feel like Zach is watching me and I get that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=48">00:00:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">extra motivation to make him proud. And by that I mean I want to put a lot of miles on those shoes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=54">00:00:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Running is something that has always been difficult for me but I love it because it is difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=59">00:00:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The hardest part is I'm left alone with my thoughts for one or two hours. Some thoughts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=65">00:01:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">are dark like thinking about mortality, my own and that of others. Some are self-critical like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=72">00:01:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">personal weaknesses or dreams not realized. Some are simply human feelings of loneliness, personal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=80">00:01:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and existential. And yet there are the moments during a run when all that fades and I'm left</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=87">00:01:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">empty of negative thoughts and full of appreciation for the beauty of experience, of nature, life,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=93">00:01:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the whole thing. This is why I return to running. Not to get in shape but to face myself and to run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=100">00:01:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">through it. That's why I'm inspired by people like Zach and by David Goggins and others like them who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=108">00:01:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">seek to find the limits of their body and mind. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast and here is my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=114">00:01:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">conversation with Zach Bitter. Where does your mind go when you're running an ultra marathon?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=121">00:02:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Are there a lot of positive thoughts, negative thoughts, demons, inspirational things, maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=127">00:02:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">no thoughts at all? - Yeah, that's the really interesting part of the sport I think 'cause</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=131">00:02:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you can, essentially what it is when we're looking at like the hundred mile distance or anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=135">00:02:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that's like all day long is you're gonna have the full range or the full spectrum of emotions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=141">00:02:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of mental processes, both kind of positive, negative and in between. So it almost feels like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=146">00:02:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you've lived multiple lives or full life maybe is the way to say it in that one time period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=154">00:02:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It's almost like a simulation of what you may experience in a long period of time in a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=159">00:02:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">condensed period of time. And I think that's just a weird mental process to reflect upon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=163">00:02:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what kind of draws people back to it. But I mean, it's a battle too, because if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=169">00:02:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">looking at it from a performance standpoint versus an experience, you obviously wanna minimize the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=173">00:02:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">negative mindset stuff. You wanna try to keep those emotions and those thought processes at a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=179">00:02:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">low. And I think when you can keep yourself from letting those thoughts creep in, you end up having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=187">00:03:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">better races and it can spiral in either direction. I noticed like there's kind of like this scenario</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=193">00:03:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that occurs where in the beginning, like a negative thing creeps in your mind, it's like super easy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=197">00:03:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">just to slap it down and say like, "Get out of here. I've did the training, I'm fit, I'm feeling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=202">00:03:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">fresh still. Everything's going well at this point in time." You get a little further along in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=208">00:03:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">race and you're starting to feel a bit of the fatigue. I mean, a little bit of self-doubt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=212">00:03:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">creeps in. You start asking yourself, "Well, maybe I should have done one more long run or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=216">00:03:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">did I not quite taper long enough?" And those things can kind of spiral into a negative way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=221">00:03:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you let it keep going, it keeps going all the way to like, "Why am I here? Why am I doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=228">00:03:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this? This is stupid." All the way to like, "There's another one of these two weeks from now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=233">00:03:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm gonna drop out of this one and sign up for that one instead." And then you just find yourself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=236">00:03:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in the exact same situation. So, you kind of have to go through the process, I think. It's why I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=242">00:04:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">think there's kind of a – I won't say it's a rule of thumb necessarily, but something I think is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=248">00:04:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">fairly valuable is if you do a hundred mile for the first time, make sure you get it done,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=254">00:04:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">even if it means like death marching is what they'll call it in the alternating community,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=259">00:04:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the end of the race. Just to say like you got that full experience, you experienced the highs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=263">00:04:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the lows, the full thing, the starting, the crossing the finish line, that release of emotion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=268">00:04:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">when you're done and all that stuff. So that when you go back to do it again, you have like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=274">00:04:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">template to build off of and you know – or you just have some data to pull from about how your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=278">00:04:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">mind is gonna work as well as your body so that you can start practicing, "Well, what do I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=282">00:04:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to do to kind of keep my mind from spiraling in a negative direction or how do I catch some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=287">00:04:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">positive momentum and kind of keep sending it that way?" And things like that. And that just,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=291">00:04:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, you just add to that over a career of running them or a series of running them and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=297">00:04:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it sharpens. It's kind of like any sport with that where you always have this balance between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=303">00:05:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the youthfulness that you may have early in your career versus the wise intelligence that you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=307">00:05:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe near the end of your career. - So in terms of wisdom, is there mechanisms by which you kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=313">00:05:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of observe the negative thoughts and let them go? So you have people like the David Gogginses who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=321">00:05:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of, he seems to almost like separate his mind into, there's the weak David that he hates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=330">00:05:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and then there's the strong one. I mean, there's like a very contentious relationship there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=335">00:05:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So he basically says like, "I refuse to be that person." And he's almost like angry at that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=340">00:05:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">person. It's almost like sometimes literally yelling at that person, the weak version of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=345">00:05:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">themselves. And then there's another more sort of Sam Harris-y approach, which is like just observe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=352">00:05:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the thought and let it go. Maybe knowing that this too shall pass, like no matter what, this moment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=361">00:06:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">will not last forever and kind of sort of accepting the natural flow of things and taking one step at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=365">00:06:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">a time and allowing whatever the negativity, whatever the pain you're experiencing just to pass,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=370">00:06:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">even if it means a death march. Which one is more effective for you? Which one, like would you say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=377">00:06:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">generally speaking to the population is more effective? Yeah, that's a really good question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=381">00:06:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's probably unique to the individual. I wouldn't argue that David is finding success with his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=388">00:06:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">approach. Some may argue it's an extreme version. Sam has obviously thought about these things and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=395">00:06:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">really probably, I see those guys as kind of two ends of the spectrum in just the way that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=403">00:06:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">come across in general, where David's really at you, kind of high energy, and Sam's kind of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=409">00:06:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">calming, soft presence, and he's just going to slowly, methodically lay it all out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=413">00:06:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think there's value in both of those. I think most people are probably going to get a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=419">00:06:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">benefit from pulling some from each. I mean, there's times where I need a kick in the ass,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=425">00:07:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and then it's like have the strong Zach, tell the weak Zach to get moving. But there's also times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=430">00:07:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">where it's just like a subtle voice entering my head about, "I don't know if I feel quite right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=436">00:07:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">now. Should I maybe pull back on the pace?" And I think that little subtle voice is best approached</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=444">00:07:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">with a subtle positive voice where it's more like, "Okay, well, let's think this through here for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=448">00:07:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">second. You're 40 miles into a 100-mile race. You spent four months preparing for it. You know from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=454">00:07:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the workouts you did that you're ready for this. There really isn't any real reason for you to slow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=460">00:07:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">down or to fall off your goal or your pace or reassess what you're doing. Let's just give this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=467">00:07:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">another mile or two, and then we can reassess if we need to in order to kind of figure out if I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=473">00:07:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">doing the right things or not." And I think in that situation, you definitely probably want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=479">00:07:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">lean more towards the Sam Harris approach with that because there's really no reason to. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=482">00:08:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">almost like the same thing you see with just training and even nutrition to a degree where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=488">00:08:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">some folks, they just want to be kind of drilled. They want to be yelled at and said, "Get going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=495">00:08:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Get doing this." And that helps and that motivates and that helps them stay accountable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=499">00:08:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Other people need some softer love with it where it's like, "This isn't necessarily your fault.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=505">00:08:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You were put in this environment that kind of created an atmosphere of lethargy and maybe poor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=510">00:08:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">nutritional choices and things like that." But it's correctable. So we need to step away from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=517">00:08:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that and we need to kind of start heading in the direction that we know is going to bear fruit down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=521">00:08:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the road. And that person may respond better to that. So I think both those guys have great value</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=527">00:08:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">with their approaches. They're just probably polar ends of the spectrum. And I think most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=532">00:08:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">people are probably going to benefit, like anything, right? You get the polarizing ones,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=535">00:08:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and those are going to work great for the polarizing people. But then most people are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=538">00:08:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">going to fit somewhere in the middle. So they're probably going to be able to kind of pull from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=542">00:09:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">both of those if they're able to sit down and kind of assess which one's going to work better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=546">00:09:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in which situation. - So the quitting thing that you mentioned,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=549">00:09:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">like the final stage, which actually I get to much quicker than you seem to, which is like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=555">00:09:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">why am I doing this? I get there with basically anything I do. It's like, this is probably the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=563">00:09:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">stupidest thing I've ever done is the feeling I get often. And then immediately you have these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=567">00:09:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">excuses that are like, there's all these other better things you should be doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=571">00:09:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Or the other alternative of that, like you said, I'm not prepared enough for this moment. I'll be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=578">00:09:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">much more prepared in two weeks for the next event. So like, why? Let's try this again. Let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=584">00:09:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">start over. Let's start over in two weeks. How do you deal with that quit? Like, so maybe do you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=592">00:09:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">still go through that process and by way of advice for people that are more sort of amateurish like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=599">00:09:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">me, how to deal with that quitting voice? - I think a lot of times when the quitting voice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=605">00:10:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of comes in, what it does is it kind of just, it comes in with the added disadvantage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=613">00:10:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess, in this situation of being kind of a narrow scoped view where you're looking at like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=619">00:10:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">what it's doing to you in the moment or how you're feeling in the moment versus how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=623">00:10:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">are you feeling about the whole process? So one thing that I started doing in 2019,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=630">00:10:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and I don't think it's necessarily, I think this was a big reason why I had one of my best racing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=638">00:10:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">seasons in 2019 that I'd had to that date. It was part of it was I started, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=644">00:10:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">putting a little more emphasis on the big picture versus putting emphasis on like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=649">00:10:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this is one opportunity or one day of work and this is one emotional kind of flare up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=656">00:10:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But how does that actually relate to my general broader picture? So when I decide to do a race</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=663">00:11:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">or an event or something like that, it's often four or six months out ahead of time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=668">00:11:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you're planning to like kind of do a series of workouts and a flow of things where you're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=672">00:11:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">through the process of getting fit, getting ready, preparing for the specifics of the day and all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=676">00:11:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that stuff. And then you get to the race itself or the event itself. And it's very easy to look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=681">00:11:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that and think that's an isolation. Like I'm going to run 12 hours today or I'm going to run 100</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=687">00:11:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">miles today or whatever it ends up being. And it's a lot easier to quit when you think to yourself,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=694">00:11:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm 40 miles into 100 mile race. That's just a 40 mile run, which sounds kind of silly to most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=701">00:11:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">people. But in perspective, and we're talking about the ultra marathon running community,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=705">00:11:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a lot easier just to say like, well, I'll scrap this 40 miles and try again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=709">00:11:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a lot harder to say, I'm going to scrap the entire last four months, the entire reason why I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=715">00:11:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">was doing it, the countless hours I spent in there. So I think I just try to reposition it of like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=720">00:12:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm in a bad place right now, maybe in my head or I'm hitting a low point here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=724">00:12:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but I'm 99% of the way towards the goal I set out four months ago when I add in all the work I did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=731">00:12:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">leading up to that. So I think it's important to ask yourself why, because I mean, there are times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=738">00:12:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">when you're doing something and you ask yourself why and you don't have a good reason. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=742">00:12:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe it is advantageous to step back and really reflect on that and decide, is this something I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=747">00:12:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">actually want to invest time and energy into? Because someone like yourself who is very much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=754">00:12:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">into a variety of different things, it can be easy probably to overextend and get... I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=760">00:12:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm a very curious person. So there's like a hundred things I would love to do if I wasn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=764">00:12:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">doing what I'm doing. And I know I would enjoy all of them. So at a certain point though, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=769">00:12:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">have to say, okay, which one is going to be the most meaningful for me? And if the answer keeps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=773">00:12:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">coming back to saying, I guess this is still the most meaningful to me out of that hundred things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=777">00:12:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that I could otherwise be doing, then I know that I'm in it for the right reason. Then I just need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=782">00:13:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to identify some of those things. Like, well, why did this one take the top spot out of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=787">00:13:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">hundred things that I could have picked from? And keeping like a list of those in your head,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=792">00:13:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">so that when you get to that point where you start saying, why am I doing this? Why am I here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=796">00:13:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You just have those kind of ready loaded in your head to say, well, I already took inventory on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=800">00:13:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that before I started this. And I knew this voice was going to come at some point, whether it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=803">00:13:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">early, middle or late. And then you just remind yourself kind of what you were thinking when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=808">00:13:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">had a little more of a level head. - Well, there's something about the thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=811">00:13:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you mentioned when you mentioned the death march. It seems extremely valuable to just never quitting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=818">00:13:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Like in the moment, if you decide to do something, like never quitting, even if it, you do go through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=826">00:13:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the process and realize that it's not the wisest thing to be doing within the full context of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=832">00:13:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">life. Like once you decide to do it, it seems like never quitting prevents you from sort of having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=839">00:13:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that escape clause from other things in your life. So I've quit on a few things in my life. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=846">00:14:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">think I still, I deeply regret that because it opened that door. It's almost like a muscle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=854">00:14:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know. So I think I'm, I don't know, maybe everyone is, but I think I'm kind of a quitter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=860">00:14:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know what I mean?

And there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1242">00:20:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it feels like the muscle of never quit will be much more important than the optimality of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1246">00:20:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">training.

And for me, like one of my big drives and one of my big passions within ultra</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1271">00:21:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">running is to first of all, find an event that I really, really love to train for and participate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1277">00:21:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in.

But one thing I think I learned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1340">00:22:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">also in 2019 was that sometimes you kind of need to step away from some of these really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1347">00:22:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">really kind of important markers in your like your performance or in whatever you're trying to do and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1353">00:22:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">take a step away from it and try to do something a little different in order to kind of hit the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1358">00:22:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">reset button on just like what I would call just like your mental energy to be able to continue to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1364">00:22:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">do it at a high level. So- - Almost like happiness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1367">00:22:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">- Exactly. Well, and here's the example. Like, I mean, I love running in trails too. Most people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1371">00:22:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">would consider me a flat road track runner, runnable ultra runner, but I like to do trail</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1376">00:22:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">runs too. So at the end of 2018, I recognized that I had been kind of pushing the gas pedal on trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1386">00:23:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to run fast hundred milers for quite a while without really a break in that where it was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1390">00:23:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, I did one. Now I'm gonna take a brief off season, but then I'm gonna ultimately build up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1395">00:23:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and peak for another one. I might introduce some fun trail races in the context, but they're gonna</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1399">00:23:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">be B races, they're gonna be training races, time on feet type of stuff that are gonna kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1403">00:23:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">mimic like a long run essentially. But the main focus, always in the back of my mind was like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1408">00:23:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">getting on the track and seeing how much faster I can run a hundred miles. And that just kind of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1413">00:23:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that energy that it takes to continually think by that, I think the motivation to keep that stope</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1419">00:23:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">high enough to really meet your full potential fades if you don't step away from it for a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1424">00:23:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">bit. So I took essentially half a year away from runnable stuff and just decided I'm gonna prepare</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1430">00:23:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">for the San Diego hundred mile, which is like a much more elevation, technical trail type of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1437">00:23:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">an event. Is that trail run or no? Yeah. It's a trail hundred miler actually just technically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1443">00:24:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">just outside of San Diego. And yeah, it goes through, it goes over part of the Pacific Crest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1449">00:24:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">trail and stuff. So it's very different than running on a runnable surface. So to give you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1453">00:24:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">some context, like I ran, what was it? I think just under 17 hours for that race. Whereas on a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1458">00:24:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">flat surface, I can run 11 hours and 19 minutes. So just the environment alone added an extra,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1464">00:24:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, five plus hours to the day. So it's just a different experience, different skill set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1471">00:24:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And what it did is it allowed me to kind of step away from kind of focusing on like splits on a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1477">00:24:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">track, running flat stuff, like preparing for things specifically for a flat environment and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1482">00:24:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">start training for something that's more climbing and descending, more technical running skill sets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1487">00:24:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and things like that. And the cool part about it was, uh, first of all, you know, when you step</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1493">00:24:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">away from something and enter something a lot different, I mean, it's still running. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1496">00:24:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">still a huge advantage I had from the running I'd done in the past. It was going to put me in a good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1500">00:25:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">position to be successful, but there was a much higher, uh, or a much bigger range of potential</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1507">00:25:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">improvement for me. So through the like, you know, four plus months I spent preparing for that race,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1513">00:25:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, I noticed, oh wow, I'm getting faster on this climb or I'm getting better at descending</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1517">00:25:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">this technical trail. It was one of the most fun races I've run actually. So it was kind of a cool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1521">00:25:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">experience. I ended up, uh, taking the lead at like 93 miles. So you were racing, racing, like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1527">00:25:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you were trying to get first. So it's still a race. Yeah. So what was the enjoyable aspect of it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1532">00:25:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think I recognized it so much while I was doing it. Actually it surfaced afterwards. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1536">00:25:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the enjoyment of the race itself is like when you find yourself in a position where you're sitting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1540">00:25:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in basically second place all day long, and then you take the lead at 90, I think it was like 91</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1544">00:25:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or 92 miles. It's like, yeah, that's kind of a cool way to race. Um, it, but afterwards I recognized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1551">00:25:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a few things just about kind of pacing and you know, how to maybe pace the first half of a hundred</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1557">00:25:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">miler versus the second half. I also recognized shortly thereafter, uh, once I finished recovering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1564">00:26:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and decided my next event was going to be a flat runnable race that, wow, I really was way more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1570">00:26:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">excited to do the workouts that I needed to do to get ready to run a fast, flat hundred miler.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1575">00:26:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't think that would have been the case had I just tried to do another flat, fast hundred</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1579">00:26:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">miler earlier or during that year and end up in a situation where like I maybe had like normalized a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1586">00:26:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">suboptimal like a outlook on like something that I had just done so many times already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1592">00:26:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I recognize that it was just every workout I did. I was like, I did this workout a year ago</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1597">00:26:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and it was not nearly this much fun or, you know, you, then the interesting thing about these track</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1602">00:26:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">hundreds too, is like, you find yourself doing like your peaking phase where you're running</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1606">00:26:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">your long runs, which for me are usually like, you know, around 30 miles or so. And I'll do them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1610">00:26:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">on back to back days. And, you know, I try to replicate the environment that I'm going to race</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1614">00:26:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">on. So I'm finding myself on a 400 meter track. And it's like, when I started doing that again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1619">00:26:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I just felt like I was super motivated to go out there Saturday and Sunday and do those back to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1622">00:27:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">back long runs and see the progress and then head out again the next week and do it again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1626">00:27:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I had some of my more enjoyable long runs, which are going to be the most specific to race</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1631">00:27:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">day environment that I had in quite some time. And I think that was really beneficial and kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1635">00:27:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of putting me in a right spot to be able to push through barriers on race day and put me in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1639">00:27:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">position where quitting was going to be much less of a likelihood given the enjoyment I had in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1645">00:27:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">months leading into the race itself. Yeah. Even the thought of quitting. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1648">00:27:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So you mentioned the track. You've also ran 100 miles on the treadmill</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1653">00:27:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and the trail 100 mile broadly. If we zoom out, what does it take to run 100 miles for most of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1662">00:27:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the world? That seems like a crazy distance to run. So maybe it's interesting to ask,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1668">00:27:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">not only is just setting the world record, but purely running. What does it take to run that far?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1675">00:27:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I mean, I think people probably overestimate what it takes in terms of just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1679">00:27:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">getting it done. I think this is consistent in just running in general. I think the marathon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1685">00:28:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">was always a big one with that where people thought like, well, you have to do this training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1690">00:28:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">or you just literally won't physically be able to complete a marathon. And then we got into an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1694">00:28:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">era of kind of like running as more of an enjoyment thing versus a performance thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1699">00:28:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you'd have people running, granted much slower. I think if you look at the Boston</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1702">00:28:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">marathon, average finishing times, it goes from like, or maybe it wasn't the Boston marathon. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1707">00:28:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">might've just been marathons in general went from like three hours to five hours or something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1710">00:28:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that. So it's like people, I think, got past the fact that you can only do it if you're optimally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1716">00:28:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">prepared to, well, I can do it and maybe not meet my full potential if I'm going to like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1721">00:28:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">not do much training, which I wouldn't necessarily advise. But I mean, I've talked to people who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1726">00:28:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">basically run 100 miles sometimes almost off the couch. And it's like, to me, what that says is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1732">00:28:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">just the human body's incredible and what it can tolerate above and beyond what it's been exposed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1736">00:28:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to if it has to, or if it feels like it has to. - So that's the basic sort of getting from point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1740">00:29:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">A from the start to the finish is the human body and the human mind is capable of doing it without</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1746">00:29:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">much preparation.

I would say the three biggest ultra</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1995">00:33:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">marathons right now, even from a historic, maybe not necessarily a historical standpoint, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=1999">00:33:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in modern day ultra running is going to be the Western States 100. That's the biggest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2004">00:33:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">most competitive hundred miler. It's on the trail side of things in the United States. Then there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2010">00:33:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">ultra trail Mount Blanc, which is probably the most competitive hundred miler on the planet right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2014">00:33:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">now. In previous years, it's been debatable as whether Western States or ultra trail Mount</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2018">00:33:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Blanc is more competitive.

The weird thing is the distance thing, right? Because most people when they think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2043">00:34:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of endurance sports, they're thinking about precise distances, like five kilometers, 10</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2046">00:34:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">kilometers and all that stuff. And then you get into the ultra running world and it's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2050">00:34:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes it's the event. So like the Western- - The course itself is much more important than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2054">00:34:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the distance. - Right. Yeah. So the Western States 100 is actually a hundred point two miles,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2058">00:34:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">which isn't that big of a deviation when you think about it, especially when you figure like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2061">00:34:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">tangents are going to probably account for more than point two miles on a hundred mile race.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2065">00:34:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But the ultra trail Mont Blanc, that's listed as a hundred miler, but it's actually, I think like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2070">00:34:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">104, 105 miles. So, it's more, there's different cultures too. So the United States is definitely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2076">00:34:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">more motivated, I think, to try to get as close to the exact distance. You're going to hear maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2081">00:34:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a little more grumbling if someone says, I signed up for this a hundred miler and it turned out to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2083">00:34:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">be a hundred and three miles versus like over in Europe, they don't really care too much about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2089">00:34:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">distance. They're more interested in like a specific route or a loop. - Is consistency important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2093">00:34:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in terms of the exact length of the route? So like you can compare performances from previous years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2098">00:34:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or are they a little bit more flexible? Like they redefine the trail from year to year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2102">00:35:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">- Yeah. I mean, it's definitely hard to compare. I mean, there's events that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2106">00:35:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">take for example, I would say the best ultra marathoner in the world today on the men's side</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2114">00:35:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is Jim Walmsley. The reason I think Jim Walmsley is the best is because he is the most versatile</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2120">00:35:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and not only is he the most versatile, but he's arguably the best at almost everything up to a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2125">00:35:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">hundred miles. So there's a race called the Angeles Crest hundred miler. The trail has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2131">00:35:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">drastically changed from when they originally had that event. And it's a different time of year. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2135">00:35:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it's much warmer on that course. And Jim's not the kind of guy who would sit back and say like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2142">00:35:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't chase that record. But I think Angela Crest, when he looks at the segments and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2145">00:35:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">pacing for that one, he's like, that one is maybe not even the same event anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2150">00:35:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have that, you have some that are a little more controlled and a little more kind of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2153">00:35:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">preserved, I guess you would say, but I think it gets really rare on the trail side.

Even on the track, like when I ran 11 hours and 19 minutes, I think I stopped three times for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2317">00:38:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe a total of like, I believe I have to look back for sure, but I think it was like three to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2320">00:38:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">four minutes or something like that.

Yeah. So if you're talking about someone, let's say that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2471">00:41:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">there's someone, well, let's just take me for example. Let's say that we could just,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2474">00:41:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we had this infinite knowledge and we knew for a fact a perfect performance for me would produce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2480">00:41:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to 1059, but I'm not going a second faster and I need to do everything right in order to run a 1059.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2485">00:41:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I would definitely want to either have a slight negative or a slight positive split.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2493">00:41:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think there's a range in there where like being a little bit faster the first half and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2501">00:41:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">second half isn't going to necessarily change your outcome or being a little bit slower the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2507">00:41:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">half and a little bit faster the second half isn't going to drastically change your outcome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2512">00:41:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's what you're referring to the split is you're looking at the first 50 miles and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2516">00:41:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">second 50 miles. And you can break it down as tiny as you want. Like I think when you take out the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2520">00:42:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">outlier laps where I stopped to use the bathroom, which would have been that like three to four</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2524">00:42:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">minute non-moving time that I talked about before, my splits were really tight. I had a couple that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2529">00:42:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">were, it was weird because that track that I did that on was actually like 400 and some weird</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2536">00:42:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">number like 438 meters or something like that.

So you get, so my pacing on that day, I ran two minutes faster the second 50 miles than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2672">00:44:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I did the first 50 miles. So my splits were very even most of the day. I actually ran some of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2676">00:44:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">fastest miles at the end. So there's gonna be probably a slight variance from my fastest mile</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2682">00:44:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to my slowest mile in like your cadence or your foot strike, but probably not by a huge margin,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2688">00:44:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but you might have a pretty big variance from one person to the next. So you get someone whose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2693">00:44:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">gait is just a little bit different. So like for me, I supinate, which means I kind of come down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2697">00:44:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">on the outside of my foot and I'm kind of more of a mid forefoot striker. So that's gonna kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2702">00:45:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of impact my cadence to a degree. Whereas you might have someone who is kind of more mid to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2708">00:45:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">rear their foot or heel striker, and they might pronate where their foot kind of rolls in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2712">00:45:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So that person may have a little bit of a different cadence as well. So you get someone,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2717">00:45:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and I think you see this in elite marathoning too, which is gonna probably just be a much larger data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2722">00:45:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">pool, much more probably precise from just like a number of opportunities to study this. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2729">00:45:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">think even their ranges from one person to the next can be, I wouldn't say drastic, but to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2734">00:45:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">degree of like 10 to maybe even 20 steps per minute or something like that from one person to the next.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2739">00:45:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But most people, the faster they go, the higher their cadence is gonna be, the slower they go,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2744">00:45:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the lower their cadence is gonna be. But there's gonna be probably a range of optimal lowness and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2749">00:45:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know, probably optimal highness too. - If you can just linger on 11 hours,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2756">00:45:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the person, first of all, would you like to be the person that breaks 11 hours? And second of all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2761">00:46:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the person that does break 11 hours, like what would it take? And third question is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2768">00:46:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is it even possible in your intuition? - Yeah. I mean, I would be lying to you if I said I didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2774">00:46:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">wanna be the first person to break 11 hours in 100 miles. I think that would be a cool barrier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2780">00:46:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to be the one to usher that in. But with that said, I think I'm much more motivated in seeing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2785">00:46:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it done from the sense that like, I think when we're talking about records, it's something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2793">00:46:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is inevitable that it's gonna get broken. So I mean, we were talking about happiness before this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2797">00:46:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So I've contemplated this in the past where I was thinking to myself like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2803">00:46:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">if my motivation is to break a world record or any record for that matter, course record,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2809">00:46:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and have that be my defining reason or my defining motivator, I probably need to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2815">00:46:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">an assessment of where my mind is at and where my focus is at and just reflect on how I'm behaving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2826">00:47:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in life because it's gonna get broken, right? I mean, I could run 10.50 tomorrow and in 10 years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2835">00:47:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">chances are that's no longer gonna be the world record anymore.

So if you're living to hold on to a record versus living to try to move the sport forward,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2847">00:47:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">which anytime you break a world record, you're moving the sport forward, then you have to look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2852">00:47:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">at that as like, that was my contribution.

What you want is that your performance or your contribution brings new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2863">00:47:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">people into the sport who are excited, motivated, and they can make their contribution. And then we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2868">00:47:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">can ultimately see, well, how fast can someone run a controlled environment 100 miler?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=2872">00:47:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what I really wanna see 'cause I think I've gotten so much enjoyment from the sport.

They're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3029">00:50:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">"If I can get away from not having to run today, that's gonna be a good day."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3032">00:50:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">[laughter]</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3033">00:50:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3034">00:50:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's one of those things that I think gets more addictive the more you do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3037">00:50:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's purely from the running perspective, there's this joy of the runner's high,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3043">00:50:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of the post after the run you feel like you can take on the world, that kind of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3046">00:50:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.

But then there's like, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3056">00:50:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the bigger picture stuff or the longer term stuff. For me, that enjoyment is just the process of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3064">00:51:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">"Okay, I'm starting at this fitness level and I'm gonna do these workouts.

Then that's another kind of short-term gratification</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3077">00:51:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that's maybe a little longer than the day-to-day, but still shorter than a career or a buildup for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3083">00:51:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a particular race where you're seeing yourself like, "Okay, maybe I'm focusing on short intervals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3088">00:51:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">right now.

We were saying, "I started here and I got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3116">00:51:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">there." And then I think there's also just like... I would call this maybe more the cherry on top,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3122">00:52:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">which is where you express your work, which is the race itself, where that's gonna be the thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3127">00:52:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that shows up on the end result and where it identifies whether you did things right or wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3134">00:52:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So there's a sense in which training is a kind of preparation towards race day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3142">00:52:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and race day being the thing where you get to be the artist.

I mean, in the grappling world, I see competition in that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3154">00:52:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">same way, when I feel the best about it, which is like... Sounds pretentious to say, but I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3161">00:52:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to be the best version of myself in this particular day of competition and to do something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3166">00:52:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that I'll be proud of in an artist way, not in some kind of numerical way, but as a holistic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3178">00:52:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sense, like do something cool.

And that to me is art. I mean, there's art within running,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3214">00:53:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there's art within chess, there's art within grappling, and you get a chance. Like all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3218">00:53:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">training is more like science, and then it feels like the competition day is art.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3223">00:53:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think that's a really cool way to look at it. And I think it's when you really open up the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3229">00:53:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">perspective of that too, it's like, even obviously, having a great day, winning the tournament or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3235">00:53:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">getting further than you were expected to, or beating someone who you've never beaten before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3238">00:53:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">something like that. Or in the running perspective, achieving that goal time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3243">00:54:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that sort of stuff. Obviously, those are kind of like the ones you, when you're honest with yourself,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3247">00:54:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you really want, and you're going to probably get the most satisfaction out of. But even when they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3252">00:54:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">don't go wrong, like maybe with your grappling tournament analogy, maybe the guy you're grappling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3258">00:54:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">against does a move on you, and you're like, "I was not prepared for that move." So now the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3262">00:54:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">enjoyment becomes, "Okay, back to the drawing board. Now I need to find out what do I do when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3268">00:54:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that happens to me next time." And that's where I think the why comes in again. Same thing with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3273">00:54:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">running. Maybe I make a mistake and eat something I didn't really want to eat or thought was going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3280">00:54:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to work, but didn't work, and it costs me more time than I gained by having it or something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3283">00:54:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that. And then I go back to the drawing board and say, "Okay, well, I can't do that. That didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3287">00:54:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">work." Or if I'm going to do that, I need to be more prepared to be able to do it. And I love that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3292">00:54:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">part of the sport, just the rearranging of things and adjusting and tinkering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3298">00:54:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There's some sense in which the mistakes and the flaws give us meaning. Because if everything,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3303">00:55:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">if you weren't able to find mistakes in something you've done, it feels like the life would be void</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3312">00:55:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of meaning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3313">00:55:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a lost opportunity too. When I look at even my 100-mile race of 11-19, I can find spots in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3324">00:55:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">there where I was like, "Oh, you know what? I could clean that up a little bit. Maybe if I do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3327">00:55:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">this differently." And that's going to get me a little bit faster. If I sat back and said, "Hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3334">00:55:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">well, things weren't great that day. Cool. Let's see if we can replicate it." Then I'd probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3338">00:55:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">run 11-19 again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3339">00:55:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So can we talk about training a little bit?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3342">00:55:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3343">00:55:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">What does your training look like year-round, day-to-day, hour-to-hour, like optimal?

And also people should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3357">00:55:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">follow you on Instagram.

But if you look at an optimal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3369">00:56:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">training process, what does that look like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3371">00:56:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So I think if we were looking at it from a philosophical level or an approach level,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3378">00:56:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there's some things that carry over from regardless of the distance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3382">00:56:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think working on your weaknesses and things that are least specific to what you're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3389">00:56:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">do on race day, but are still going to be important things in terms of improving your ability to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3395">00:56:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">perform on race day or maximizing your potential with the things that are specific, you do first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3401">00:56:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I say that, but there's a caveat with endurance sport. I think maybe even more specifically with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3408">00:56:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">things like our ultra marathons or 100 milers where you want a really strong aerobic foundation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3413">00:56:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">or a base before you really start, I think, structuring things towards a specific one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3420">00:57:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So for me, I think a target for me is oftentimes getting really fit at what my pace would be at,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3429">00:57:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">my aerobic threshold or what a lot of people will maybe call a maximum aerobic function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3433">00:57:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The running world is weird where we have these terminologies where there's sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3437">00:57:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple words that essentially mean the same thing, but one is from an actual physiological</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3443">00:57:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">reaction and one is just a feeling and stuff like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3445">00:57:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">- You mentioned time on feet versus time in optimal physiological state.

And there's conflicting ideas about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3465">00:57:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">how to structure it. I think a lot of times, time on feet in most cases is just going to be like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=3472">00:57:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">"I'm running easy, whatever feels easy that day."

And it also like, it avoids a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4327">01:12:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">situation where, oh, my ready-made plan says I'm supposed to do this run today, but I don't feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4333">01:12:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">great today. So what do I do? I mean, some people are fine with that because they're aware enough of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4337">01:12:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">like the process that they can adjust it themselves. Other folks just need a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4342">01:12:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">more support. So that's kind of the difference there. But in terms of the structure of it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4346">01:12:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it kind of goes with an approach where we're saying you build this foundation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4351">01:12:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to spend, you know, usually anywhere between 8 to 12 weeks just building up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4356">01:12:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">your aerobic foundation.

And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4367">01:12:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">once they kind of have that foundation laid, then it's time to get into the specifics of whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4371">01:12:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">distance they're doing. So if it were, it will differ will be like if they're doing right now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4376">01:12:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">on those plans, I think I've got 5k half marathon, marathon, 50k, 80 to 100k and then 100 miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4382">01:13:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So if they pick a 5k plan, the order of operations is going to be different than if they pick the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4386">01:13:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">100 mile plan, you're going to see some of the same workouts show up in that plan. It just can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4391">01:13:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">be different areas of it. So once they're really fit at that, you know, that foundational level,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4398">01:13:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">then, you know, if they're doing say 100 mile plan, they might start doing some short intervals,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4402">01:13:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">which I would on my plans, I usually range between 30 seconds up to four minutes. It's kind of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4407">01:13:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">short interval range. Can you describe what you mean by short interval? It's like a sprint and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4412">01:13:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">then a rest? Yeah. Yeah. So I'll use basically like I'll use like a basically a 12 minute time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4418">01:13:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">trial. And that's going to kind of like dictate for them what the intensity and the pace is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4423">01:13:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to be for some of those when they're under a minute, they'll push past that a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4428">01:13:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But usually when we're up to like above a minute, and certainly up to four minutes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4431">01:13:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like whatever pace or intensity that they get for that kind of 12 minute time trial,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4436">01:13:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">where they're just seeing how far they can go in 12 minutes is going to be kind of like about where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4441">01:14:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">they're going to target for those intervals.

How do you figure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4456">01:14:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">out how far you can go in 12 minutes? Is that just a trial and error you build up to it? There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4462">01:14:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">formulas? What? Yeah, there's some newer formulas that are probably a little less brutal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4467">01:14:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Where you kind of, I haven't really dove into these that that in depth yet, I know like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4474">01:14:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that you can kind of replicate it by doing like a short, a very short interval,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=4480">01:14:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then a slightly longer one.

of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=7855">02:10:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">places, especially early in someone's ultra

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RTWSJAqTPg&t=7987">02:13:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's just so many variables that are uncontrollable on this type of an
