Today, I have the pleasure of speaking with Andy Matuszak,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">who is a researcher, engineer, and designer working on tools for thought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">In addition to this podcast on Andy's YouTube channel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">we did an interesting collaboration, which I encourage you all to check out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">where I just watched Andy try to learn some new material.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was just an intro chapter of quantum mechanics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I honestly, I was expecting to see some cool techniques or be impressed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">but I was way more surprised than I expected to be by the deliberateness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the effortfulness of the practice, how what was really, I mean, it was like 15 minutes a page in this textbook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And any small thing that Andy thought, like, I don't fully understand this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The author is trying to say something here. He's trying to draw an analogy or relationship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not sure I totally comprehend the relationship between this classical mechanics equation and quantum mechanics equation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The author thinks it's analogous, just really delving deep in that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So I was super, I thought that was really interesting that this is a way to approach a new material.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So in this conversation, I'm looking forward to talking with Andy about not only that experience,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">but a whole bunch of his other research and the other tools he's built.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me ask you this. So that experience made me think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">listen, this is somebody who actually cares about understanding the material or going through it this deliberately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you think people in general care about actually integrating and understanding the material they're consuming in books and textbooks?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't you think they'd make more effort to actually assimilate that information if they cared to?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, I think the statement is just a little too general probably to comment on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, so I think it's certainly the case that most students don't actually want to do this because they're learning stuff that they don't actually care about learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Or even if they do care about learning it, often there isn't a clear connection between whatever reading or activity they're doing in the moment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and the thing that originally inspired them for the subject, what they actually want to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's always something tenuous going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, on the other hand, it's amazing to look at, say, subreddits and to look at the level of nerdery and fascination that will be brought to bear on gardening equipment or knots, for instance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, people are competing to tie some very obscure 18th century knot or whatever, and they're flipping through almanacs from the period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, when people are interested and it connects to something that's truly meaningful for them, I think they really do want to absorb.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And we see that in their behavior. There is a second thing that I think is relevant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, to explain this, I will reference Mortimer Adler and Van Doren's How to Read a Book, which is a great guide on serious reading.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And they consider the case of people who often have books on their bedside table, and sometimes they're very difficult or demanding books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">These are kind of aspirational, like, "Oh, I wish I could read King Lear. I want to be the kind of person who reads King Lear."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You put it on your bedside table and people will read it before bed, and they'll find that they fall asleep while they're reading it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">They're not really absorbing or understanding this book. I mean, it's not just an issue of memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like they simply are not apprehending the words on the page.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And the authors of How to Read a Book make the case that the issue here with these people who are falling asleep reading King Lear is, in many cases,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not that they don't want to stay awake and to really deal with that text.

So one enduring result in education psychology is that when you're doing a lot of cognition, metacognition is difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I mean by that is like when you're thinking really hard about the stuff on the page, it's very difficult for you to like plan,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">regulate yourself, figure out what the best next action to do is, reflect and evaluate, you know, whether you're understanding things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, all the stuff that we're talking about, about asking questions, that all that gets harder as the material gets harder and as it gets less familiar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So one common thread, at least in kind of learning science stuff, has been to outsource metacognition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So some of the ways we outsource that are actually very familiar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">They're things like somebody gives you a syllabus and tells you what to read when you reference that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So that is a user interface like that is a design practice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're a self-motivated student, one thing you can do and that I've done is just go appropriate a syllabus from,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, some graduate level course that corresponds to the text that you're reading and say like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">well, you know, that might be a good guide as to what's most important, how to approach this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">There are also lots of things that that one can build directly into the interfaces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Just as one example, in Quantum Country, which was a textbook that Michael Nielsen and I developed to explore some ideas around augmented reading experiences,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we embedded a bunch of review questions every, say, 1500 words or so in this text on quantum computation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And our primary intention in doing this was to help people remember what they read.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And we had this theory that part of what makes it hard to learn a complex subject is that there's all these new definitions and notation and terms and things being thrown at you at once.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're being asked to combine these things which are still unfamiliar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you're constantly having to retrieve these elements and struggling to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Either it's taking a while or your success rate is low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So anyway, that was our motivation, but it had this other metacognitive benefit that was really important that you read 1500 words and now you're being asked these questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">That is an opportunity for you to notice that you did not, in fact, absorb what was in that thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Not that you don't remember, but that like, you know, there's there's a word in the question that is apparently important that you simply didn't even notice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so not only does that give you feedback, so it tells you, oh, maybe you need to go reread that specific section, but it may also change your behavior towards future sections.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So in interviews, readers told us, for instance, that after they reached the first set of questions or a particularly difficult set of questions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">they found themselves slowing down and reading more attentively or realizing actually that their reading practices were ineffective in general.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You're kind of in the way that you were mentioning towards the start of the

research on the key phrase here is something like adjunct questions, you know, questions that go along with a text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That's kind of like what I was just talking about.

You probably have a bunch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1246" target="_blank">00:20:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">patterns, whether you know it or not. You read a thing that a person has written in hopes of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">generating good questions about it. And even though you don't have this habit for textbooks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1258" target="_blank">00:20:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">yet, maybe, of constantly demanding things of the textbook, you have, I think, started to develop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">this of essays or blog posts that interesting people you're interviewing have read.

You can focus more on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1282" target="_blank">00:21:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">material. You can probably take on more difficult material or actually understand material at a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1288" target="_blank">00:21:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">higher level than you could have before, because less of yourself is engaged in this kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1294" target="_blank">00:21:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">question of how do I make the questions from the material?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I certainly hope so. Otherwise, there's a question to be asked of what I've been doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1300" target="_blank">00:21:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">all these years. So, you know, having interviewed some of these people who are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1305" target="_blank">00:21:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">infovores and have consumed and continuously consume a lot of content, this is something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you also noticed and pointed out in your notes. But, you know, Tyler Cowen, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1316" target="_blank">00:21:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think he has any sort of note-taking practice. He just, you know, just devours</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1321" target="_blank">00:22:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">information. What is your theory of how these people are integrating things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. Tyler is a good example. I think he's actually a little easier than some others we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1331" target="_blank">00:22:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">might discuss. So let's talk about Tyler for a second. One of the other things that's so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1334" target="_blank">00:22:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting about Tyler is his writing obligations. So this is a man who's blogged every day since,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1340" target="_blank">00:22:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know, 2007 or something like this, and has a Bloomberg column, I think, weekly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1347" target="_blank">00:22:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">something like 1500 words, and also has published something like a book a year for, I don't know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1352" target="_blank">00:22:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a decade or more, and occasionally publishes some academic articles, plus like a bunch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1356" target="_blank">00:22:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of other collateral. So that is notes. And I think it's also important to note that, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1363" target="_blank">00:22:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the way that Tyler writes these blog posts and the way that Tyler does these columns and even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the books is very different from the way that many other book authors work. Like, Tyler,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the blog posts often have this, like, real first draft mentality to them. Like, he's just thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1381" target="_blank">00:23:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">out loud. Right, right. And he's got decades of practice thinking out loud and, like, writing down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1387" target="_blank">00:23:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a decent take the first time. And so, you know, he gets something pretty good the first time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1392" target="_blank">00:23:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">much of the time. And that works for him. So, like, that kind of is a note,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1395" target="_blank">00:23:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Like, doing the thing, I guess, like, your initial thoughts on the subject is kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of what you would write in a note. Yeah. One of my former guests, Scott Young,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">was comparing Brian Kaplan and Tyler Cowen's books. And he said, you know, you read a Brian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Kaplan book, and it's like a chess game. Right. Like, the opponent is, if you try to move a pawn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">up on this case for education, I've got this, you know, rook that I can move here. With Tyler,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it's more like, you know, he's, like, shooting the shit on a subject, basically. Yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1422" target="_blank">00:23:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Bangladeshi train stations. Yeah, right, right, right. On a separate question, do LLMs make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">memorization more or less valuable, right? So, there's a case you can make for both.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1431" target="_blank">00:23:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But on that, is it more important to have more Anki cards in your deck?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1436" target="_blank">00:23:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe this is a good time to talk about what memorization is, or, like, what it's for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1442" target="_blank">00:24:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we could use that word to refer to the practice of, like, learning more trivia,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">for instance. So, for instance, a thing that I and some people I know have done is, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1453" target="_blank">00:24:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">gone through this book, Cell Biology by the Numbers, which says all of these things, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1457" target="_blank">00:24:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">how big exactly is a nucleotide? Like, how much volume does it take up? It's kind of helpful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">occasionally, to know that it's about a nanoliter, and that that can help you model things. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1467" target="_blank">00:24:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you can just, like, commit all of those things to memory, right? That's one kind of memorization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1470" target="_blank">00:24:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And we could talk about how LLMs affect that. But I just want to make the case that so much of what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1477" target="_blank">00:24:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you do and experience day-to-day is memory-bound, or is memory-influenced in important ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1484" target="_blank">00:24:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, just for instance, your ability to understand a difficult argument, even in the course of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1494" target="_blank">00:24:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">text, is memory-bound. Some of that's working memory. But your ability to understand an argument</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1502" target="_blank">00:25:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that has many steps in it, more steps than you can keep in your working memory, depends on your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1506" target="_blank">00:25:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">ability to think of some of those steps in terms of some stuff that you already know, so that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1511" target="_blank">00:25:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">can kind of reduce it or abstract it. Likewise, in creative work, there's a bunch of studies trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1518" target="_blank">00:25:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to catalog case studies of how it is that people have flashes of insight. You know, it's a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1523" target="_blank">00:25:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">hard to talk about that. But one of the things that's a pretty consistent source for insight for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">people is noticing a surprising connection or a surprising contradiction. Probably feels pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1534" target="_blank">00:25:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">familiar, right? Like, you're reading through the newspaper and you see, like, people have finally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1538" target="_blank">00:25:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">figured out how to do X. And you're like, wait a minute, that means if I combine it with this other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1542" target="_blank">00:25:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">thing, we'd be able to do Y! Or something like that, you know? Now, that's only possible if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the other thing is in your memory. Like, if you have to think to look up the other thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1554" target="_blank">00:25:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">then the newspaper wouldn't seem so salient to you. Likewise, like, and in just really boring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1561" target="_blank">00:26:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">ways, early on in my time in Khan Academy, I just learned in a very thorough way using memory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1568" target="_blank">00:26:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">systems, just a whole lot of details about the education market. And this let me be in, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">high-level executive kind of conversations where we're trying to figure out strategy stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1580" target="_blank">00:26:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And somebody would propose a particular direction or, you know, what about this? What about that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1585" target="_blank">00:26:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I could say, like, well, you know, the total budget spending for instructional materials is this. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1590" target="_blank">00:26:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">like, that market is growing by this percent per year. And 10% of students in the U.S. are in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1595" target="_blank">00:26:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">place. And, you know, and so on and so forth. And so basically, like, on the fly, I can evaluate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1600" target="_blank">00:26:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">ideas in a way that others can't. So anyway, this and other things are kind of just part of my rant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1606" target="_blank">00:26:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">about people. I think in general, we under-appreciate the role that memory has in our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1612" target="_blank">00:26:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">lives. So just to come back to the question, explicit memorization or explicit making sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1617" target="_blank">00:26:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that you can recall the thing reliably, we can test it against these things. So for the case of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1621" target="_blank">00:27:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the creative instinct, for instance, noticing the contradiction, noticing the connection,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1626" target="_blank">00:27:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I imagine that we will have future notebooks that will do some of this noticing with us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1634" target="_blank">00:27:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And that will decrease our need to be able to rely on our own sense of salience or something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1644" target="_blank">00:27:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that. But I guess I don't know how much. I'm skeptical that, like, my own experience coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1650" target="_blank">00:27:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">up with weird ideas that feel very new is that it feels very personal.

So yeah, there's some role there. There's some theories that the reason we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1756" target="_blank">00:29:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">have forgetting is that our ancestral environment was very traumatic. And so our episodic memory,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1762" target="_blank">00:29:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in particular, we would like to maybe not be all that faithful. I actually don't know the status</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1769" target="_blank">00:29:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of those theories. Probably why we forget dreams as well, right? Like dreams are pretty traumatic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1773" target="_blank">00:29:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">if you thought of them at the same as a real life experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1776" target="_blank">00:29:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So I mean, another weird thing about memory is that as far as we can determine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1781" target="_blank">00:29:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">memories aren't lost exactly, at least not completely.

If</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1791" target="_blank">00:29:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you can cue them right, people can bring things back, even things that they feel are lost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1798" target="_blank">00:29:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, you can also cue people in ways that are hallucinatory.

But I guess the reason why I bring that up is that it flies in the face of this view</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1808" target="_blank">00:30:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that there's a limit.

And this is aligned with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1832" target="_blank">00:30:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">experimental literature, which seems to suggest that there's probably upper bounds, but we're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1838" target="_blank">00:30:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">close to them.

So there isn't a resource management</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1859" target="_blank">00:30:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">argument. Well, if there isn't, why do we forget so many things? Is there some reason the brain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1867" target="_blank">00:31:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">just finds so many things working across?

No, it's a good question. So we're getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1877" target="_blank">00:31:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to a part of the cognitive science space that I'm less familiar with and also that I suspect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1884" target="_blank">00:31:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we simply know less about. But let me just riff a little bit. One of the things that we sort of know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1890" target="_blank">00:31:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is this idea of spreading activation. So when you go to try to look something up or when you try to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1899" target="_blank">00:31:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">deal with a particular situation, there's something almost kind of like DNS exchanges or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1905" target="_blank">00:31:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">routing on a network or something where, okay, we start from some point that it's like a stimulus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1911" target="_blank">00:31:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and just speaking very informally, we kind of expand outwards from there and there are effectively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1917" target="_blank">00:31:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">weights on those connections. And by tuning those weights effectively, we route the packets on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1923" target="_blank">00:32:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">network effectively. Memory is encoded in these weights, at least partially. So if you didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1928" target="_blank">00:32:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">forget things, then you might just have this weird cacophony on the network. And in particular,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1935" target="_blank">00:32:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">what's salient? What to do next? Which response seems most appropriate to this question? You might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1943" target="_blank">00:32:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">answer those kinds of things very ineffectively because all this stuff is coming up for you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1948" target="_blank">00:32:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that is much less relevant. One of the theories about how well we remember stuff in what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1954" target="_blank">00:32:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">circumstances is actually called predictive utility theory. And it suggests that the probability of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1959" target="_blank">00:32:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">retrieval of a particular item in a given situation actually does correspond with basically a model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1966" target="_blank">00:32:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of to what extent the brain predicts it will be useful. Right. And then the prediction doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1972" target="_blank">00:32:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">necessarily map on to... Doesn't necessarily, exactly. And so when you repeatedly access</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1978" target="_blank">00:32:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">something, when you practice retrieving it, the prediction of the utility of the thing goes up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1983" target="_blank">00:33:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And when you do it in a variety of situations, it goes up across a broader</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1987" target="_blank">00:33:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">distribution. Okay. So this is interesting. When did you start your memory practice? Presumably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1993" target="_blank">00:33:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it was after Apple? Yeah. Okay. So let me ask you this. So at Apple, you were in charge of a bunch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=1998" target="_blank">00:33:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of important flagship features on iOS and I'm guessing other things. Presumably you didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2004" target="_blank">00:33:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">have some sort of practice, but since you were encountering these things day to day, that natural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2010" target="_blank">00:33:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">frequency and way in which problems came up, did you have a worse understanding of these problems</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2016" target="_blank">00:33:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and the things now knowing what you do and having the practices you do, you're able to comprehend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2021" target="_blank">00:33:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">now? I don't know if that question made sense. No, that's a great question. So I mean, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2026" target="_blank">00:33:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">here's a fun thing.

So I mean, it was just totally different. Let's talk about this a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2039" target="_blank">00:33:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit. This feels very, very juicy for me. Most of what I was doing was engineering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2045" target="_blank">00:34:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">some of it very difficult engineering, but mostly engineering, mostly on things that were fairly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2051" target="_blank">00:34:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">well understood. So I wasn't trying to decide what should be done usually. Sometimes I was from a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2058" target="_blank">00:34:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">technical perspective, but certainly rarely from a product perspective was that a relevant question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2063" target="_blank">00:34:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">for me. I was kind of like a somewhat design minded engineer and I did a bunch of kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2069" target="_blank">00:34:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">engineering and design-ish things on tasks which were set out for me. At that point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2074" target="_blank">00:34:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I had been programming for a really long time.

I learned a ton of stuff about the internals of those systems, but because I already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2143" target="_blank">00:35:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">had such a rich understanding, both of Apple's platforms and of computer science and engineering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2147" target="_blank">00:35:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in general, I had this really rich network for stuff to slot into. So learning stuff is easier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2154" target="_blank">00:35:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">when you have other stuff to connect it to. It's a nice principle. Metacognitive load on me was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2159" target="_blank">00:35:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">lighter because others were figuring out what we should be doing. So just by contrast, now I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2165" target="_blank">00:36:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">doing research. I'm trying to discover things that are not known. I'm trying to make things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2169" target="_blank">00:36:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't exist. The hard questions that I answer are mostly like what should be done or what should I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2174" target="_blank">00:36:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">do? And that question is not just a technical one of how should I implement this feature that needs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2180" target="_blank">00:36:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to get built, but what intervention on a reader should be taken? That requires synthesizing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2186" target="_blank">00:36:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">lots of different unfamiliar literatures. There's two different threads I want to go on. Maybe I'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2192" target="_blank">00:36:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">just mention the other one. This is also related to the thing we're talking about a few minutes ago</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2196" target="_blank">00:36:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">with LLMs. There's this thing that I'm sure you've talked about yourself as well, the Swanson</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2201" target="_blank">00:36:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">linking, where this guy was just... I don't know Swanson linking. Okay. Actually, Michael Nielsen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2206" target="_blank">00:36:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">has written about it in his book. Okay, cool. But this guy was just somebody who read the medical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2210" target="_blank">00:36:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">literature and he was just familiar with a lot of esoteric results. So different things would come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2219" target="_blank">00:36:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">up and he would be able to figure out different things are connected. For example, I think he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2224" target="_blank">00:37:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">noticed in one case that headaches are linked to some other symptom and that other symptom is linked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2231" target="_blank">00:37:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to magnesium deficiency. And so apparently a whole bunch of people's headaches were solved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2236" target="_blank">00:37:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">once they were given a magnesium supplement and he noticed that connection. Again, this is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2239" target="_blank">00:37:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of sort of combinatorial thing that you wouldn't notice otherwise. But on this subject</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2245" target="_blank">00:37:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">itself, so listen, there's this natural way in which you're able to get up to speed in all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2251" target="_blank">00:37:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">things that are happening in Apple. Is it possible and maybe advantageous to do similar kinds of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2256" target="_blank">00:37:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">things in other fields? For example, instead of doing an explicit space repetition system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2260" target="_blank">00:37:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">when you're trying to absorb material from books, you just read a cluster of books and hopefully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2265" target="_blank">00:37:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">things will just come up that are relevant to get in again. Or is there value in having explicit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2270" target="_blank">00:37:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">practice of setting up cars and so on? Yeah, right. So again, the answer is going to be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2274" target="_blank">00:37:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it depends. I think that maybe the most familiar example of what you're talking about is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2280" target="_blank">00:38:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">immersion learning a new language. So immersion learning is a great thing and it's going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2286" target="_blank">00:38:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">more interesting and more effective than doing space repetition practice. It's going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2290" target="_blank">00:38:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">integrative. It's going to be socially based. There's a bunch of stuff about social learning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2295" target="_blank">00:38:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that's relevant. A problem is though, is that say that you decide you want to learn Swahili today</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2300" target="_blank">00:38:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and you go down to the local Swahili community center and you're like, "Cool, I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2306" target="_blank">00:38:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">immerse myself." Good luck. You can't even get started. So through this lens, explicit practice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2313" target="_blank">00:38:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is a way to bootstrap yourself. Likewise, a great way to become a better musician. All of the best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2320" target="_blank">00:38:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">pianists at sight reading that I knew in university played with churches. They were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2327" target="_blank">00:38:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">so good at sight reading because they had to show up every Sunday and they're playing a different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2331" target="_blank">00:38:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">thing. New hymn every Sunday. So this is immersion also. And over time they're learning all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2337" target="_blank">00:38:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">cadences and these things that are really common and whatever. But you can't show up and be the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2342" target="_blank">00:39:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">church pianist every Sunday in the first place if you don't already have some decent foundation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2348" target="_blank">00:39:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is sort of a bootstrapping argument that one role for explicit practice of this kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2353" target="_blank">00:39:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is to get yourself into a position where you can more naturalistically reinforce.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2357" target="_blank">00:39:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I see. Okay, got it. But there are still going to be instances where the naturalistic reinforcement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2362" target="_blank">00:39:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">isn't going to work. So for example, the linking that you brought up. One issue for doctors is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2367" target="_blank">00:39:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">rare diagnoses. So if it's only going to be once every couple of years that you see a patient</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2374" target="_blank">00:39:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that's going to present with these symptoms, that's not going to be frequent enough to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2379" target="_blank">00:39:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">naturally reinforce your memory of that. And you're going to need some out-of-band mechanism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2383" target="_blank">00:39:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And unfortunately, I think for many kind of creative leaps and creative insights,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2387" target="_blank">00:39:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that may be closer to the regime that we're in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2390" target="_blank">00:39:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Where in many fields, you just have the things you're regularly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2394" target="_blank">00:39:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">doing is the thing you need to reinforce. It makes a lot of sense that if you're a researcher,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2398" target="_blank">00:39:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the long tail of events that might come up is a thing you're, you know, it might happen once</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2402" target="_blank">00:40:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">every few months. But the regularity is not a thing that matters, right? It's sort of an effect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2406" target="_blank">00:40:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">on your work. Here's a question I actually have. So when we were doing the practice or when we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2410" target="_blank">00:40:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">doing the quantum mechanics textbook, it was like three hours. And afterwards, I was just exhausted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2418" target="_blank">00:40:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was actually surprised that you went the entire three hours without interruption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2422" target="_blank">00:40:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so afterwards, I was packing up and you were like, "Hey, I'm about to actually go to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2426" target="_blank">00:40:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">my piano lesson." I was so confused at how you had the stamina to keep going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2433" target="_blank">00:40:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Is the stamina just inherent in you? Or is that something you did to develop?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2437" target="_blank">00:40:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the things that I think is funny about stamina is first off, there's some kind of weird</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2441" target="_blank">00:40:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">grass is always greener kind of situation where I often feel struck by other people's stamina and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2446" target="_blank">00:40:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">feel like I have very little of it. I struggle with energy. I've actually written extensively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2451" target="_blank">00:40:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">about all my struggles with energy and ways of managing energy. I spent a lot of time thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2456" target="_blank">00:40:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">about it and managing my energy levels, structuring my day around it. So I think there is something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2460" target="_blank">00:41:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">where one often feels maybe lower stamina than one actually is because one misapprehends other's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2467" target="_blank">00:41:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">stamina. Okay, so in that particular situation, how do I explain why three hours of studying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2472" target="_blank">00:41:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">et cetera? First off, social. So if I were alone and studying that book for three hours</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2478" target="_blank">00:41:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and I weren't effectively trying to perform for you, it wouldn't have been nearly as energizing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2488" target="_blank">00:41:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">for me and I definitely would have taken breaks. I still would have been able to go for three hours,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2493" target="_blank">00:41:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think. Part of the reason for that is that it's simply way less hard than things I normally do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2499" target="_blank">00:41:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">In some sense, learning quantum mechanics should be much harder and it kind of is cognitively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2505" target="_blank">00:41:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">demanding in a lot of ways. It's much more cognitively demanding in kind of a direct way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2511" target="_blank">00:41:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">than what I actually do day to day.

I don't know. These aren't all the same thing exactly. But sitting and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2535" target="_blank">00:42:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">staring at a page and deciding what you should do next on a research project is incredibly draining</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2541" target="_blank">00:42:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">on that resource. The not knowing, sitting and not knowing is like the hardest thing that I do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2547" target="_blank">00:42:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in my work. And so there's something, it's like a wonderful vacation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2552" target="_blank">00:42:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to be presented with, "Oh great, somebody else is going to tell me what to do.

So it's a game that has no text, at least no text that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2760" target="_blank">00:46:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">relevant to the game elements.

And it gets to the point where it feels</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2791" target="_blank">00:46:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">like you're in conversation with the game's designers.

No one's asking you, right? There's no text, but you can feel that you are being asked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2803" target="_blank">00:46:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And you perform some interaction in the environment.

The issue seems to be that games are ultimately, they're an aesthetic form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2851" target="_blank">00:47:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">The purpose of the game is to have an experience that feels a particular way.

Grant's videos are also serving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2866" target="_blank">00:47:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a different purpose from the text.

You start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=2917" target="_blank">00:48:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">with memory and you build a virtual computer and you build Tetris.

They can absorb</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3046" target="_blank">00:50:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">some of that knowledge. That's part of how apprentices absorb that knowledge. There's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3051" target="_blank">00:50:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">few things that are missing. You know, you're not getting feedback. There's a whole lot of chat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3056" target="_blank">00:50:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">there. Like there's a whole lot of stuff that probably isn't all that meaningful. It's also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3060" target="_blank">00:51:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">true for apprentices. So I'm pretty actually, I'm pretty excited about streaming videos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3066" target="_blank">00:51:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I have, I've complained loudly that there aren't more designer streamers. So one of the things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3073" target="_blank">00:51:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think is really interesting is that we have some disciplines like programming, where there are like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3079" target="_blank">00:51:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">a million books on courses about how to learn to program. And they don't, they don't give you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3085" target="_blank">00:51:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">everything you need. There's this tacit knowledge stuff that you need to develop. But like, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3090" target="_blank">00:51:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like if you work through these courses, if you go through the MIT OpenCourseWare for computer science,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3094" target="_blank">00:51:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like you'll be able to build some stuff.

This is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3099" target="_blank">00:51:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">true in all domains.

And so it's good to see lots of programmer streamers, but I really want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3127" target="_blank">00:52:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to see the streamers in these other domains. Right. On the point about the more programming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3132" target="_blank">00:52:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">books, ironically, the reason why there's some more resources on programming is that it's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3137" target="_blank">00:52:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">so legible, but it already makes it easier to understand in the first place. So you just have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3141" target="_blank">00:52:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">this reinforcement. But so, you know, the Nantatestris is, let's say it's like a video game</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3147" target="_blank">00:52:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">analog to learning, maybe not just programming, but how things in the internals of the computer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3152" target="_blank">00:52:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">work.

I have a friend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3158" target="_blank">00:52:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">who has a sort of intense sort of manic energy, and he used to be addicted to video games when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3163" target="_blank">00:52:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">he was a teenager.

I think what makes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3178" target="_blank">00:52:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">programming feel like a video game is this sense of instantaneousness, this sense of direct contact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3189" target="_blank">00:53:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">with the environment.

And as you manipulate it, you're constantly getting this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3198" target="_blank">00:53:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">feedback, the red squiggly, you're pressing command R regularly, and you're seeing it fail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3206" target="_blank">00:53:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And that feels great. Like there's this feeling that's very common for programmers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3212" target="_blank">00:53:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's laden with doom. The feeling is, it's like 9 p.m., and you've been working on a thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3220" target="_blank">00:53:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">all day, and it's almost working. It's almost working. And, you know, like if you just debug</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3225" target="_blank">00:53:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this one thing, then like your project will be like done, and you'll be able to like go. So you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3230" target="_blank">00:53:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like, well, I'll just stay up, and like I'll debug this one last thing. And then you start debugging</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3235" target="_blank">00:53:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it, and you get it, and you solve it, and that feels great. And then immediately you like run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3240" target="_blank">00:54:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">into like one more thing.

It's almost going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3243" target="_blank">00:54:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">end to end. And you're like, well, I'll just stay up a little bit longer. And you know, before you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3246" target="_blank">00:54:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">know it, it's like 2 a.m. And you keep going, because it feels so good. Like you feel the sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3252" target="_blank">00:54:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of forward progress. You're not just staring at a wall. I think like for the programming problems</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3256" target="_blank">00:54:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">where you are at a brick wall, it doesn't feel like this. It feels bad. So can every field be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3263" target="_blank">00:54:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">transformed into something where you can feel the sense of forward progress? You can get this rapid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3267" target="_blank">00:54:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">feedback cycle? I think that's really hard. I think some fields, like it's not clear to me that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3274" target="_blank">00:54:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">they can be transformed in that way. I think we can get a lot closer in most cases than we're at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3285" target="_blank">00:54:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">right now. So what's hard about designing user interface is that often there's this feeling of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3292" target="_blank">00:54:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">exploring kind of a combinatorial search space. Programming often feels like a search problem,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3298" target="_blank">00:54:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">too. You have a sense that there's like there's some right way to solve the problem. There might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3304" target="_blank">00:55:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">be some set of right ways to solve the problem. And you're kind of looking for it. And you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3307" target="_blank">00:55:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">some heuristics that guide you to like, oh, this might be a dynamic programming problem. Or this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3311" target="_blank">00:55:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">might be something that is solved well by, you know, separating concerns or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3316" target="_blank">00:55:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Design often feels less like that. You have those heuristics, too. You have those patterns, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3321" target="_blank">00:55:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Often it just feels like, nope, I just need to try like 300 things. And so there's this like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3327" target="_blank">00:55:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">characteristic where you'll look at a designer's Figma file. And like what you do in Figma is you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3333" target="_blank">00:55:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">press command D. This is like the core action of Figma is to duplicate. So you have an artboard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3339" target="_blank">00:55:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You tried something. You're like, that didn't work. So you select it and you press command D.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3344" target="_blank">00:55:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what you end up with, and you look at design Twitter, and it's just all these screenshots of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3347" target="_blank">00:55:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">people's Figmas with like a million artboards.

And you don't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3353" target="_blank">00:55:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this feeling, or at least I don't. I think many designers don't have this feeling of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3357" target="_blank">00:55:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">progress. It's like you're just kind of exploring parts of the search space. And like you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3362" target="_blank">00:56:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">learning that parts of the search space don't work. And eventually you stumble on one that does,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3369" target="_blank">00:56:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">but you don't have this feeling of like getting closer often. Often there will be like weeks that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3375" target="_blank">00:56:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">go by without feeling like you're getting closer because what you're doing is just kind of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3379" target="_blank">00:56:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">narrowing the search space.

So to some extent, I think they are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=3398" target="_blank">00:56:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">skillful.

And it also, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=4287" target="_blank">01:11:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it was hugely time consuming, because I didn't have techniques or tools.

When I was trying to think about what to do next,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6349" target="_blank">01:45:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the most obvious or natural idea was like, well, what if we just try that with lots of other things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6354" target="_blank">01:45:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that idea occurred to me and the pandemic had just struck. So I was feeling a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6358" target="_blank">01:45:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">timid, I guess, creatively or emotionally. I wanted something that felt kind of safe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6364" target="_blank">01:46:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I knew that I could do that. Like, okay, I can build a platform that like generalizes this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6368" target="_blank">01:46:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that we did for this textbook. So I did. And I did it relatively quickly. I did it in a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6373" target="_blank">01:46:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">months. And that wasn't the right thing to do. It wasn't really the right question to be asking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6378" target="_blank">01:46:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea wasn't that strong. It wasn't the right way to test it. Like building this highly general</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6385" target="_blank">01:46:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">version of it, I would have been better building more one-offs rather than like a self-serve thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6389" target="_blank">01:46:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that anyone could use. And this comes down to like the difference in aim. Like, I'm not trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6394" target="_blank">01:46:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">build some kind of scalable thing for the world at this moment. I'm trying to build the idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6400" target="_blank">01:46:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The prototype is an expression of the idea. And once it arrives at a good place, then maybe there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6407" target="_blank">01:46:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">can be some scalable solution. But it's not necessarily at that place. And until it's at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6412" target="_blank">01:46:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that place, there's like a lot of thinking and sketching that goes along with the building and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6417" target="_blank">01:46:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">prototyping. I think part of my confusion here is that often I still need to hear this advice. Like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6421" target="_blank">01:47:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">often I will just tie myself in knots in theory land. And like what I really need to do is to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6427" target="_blank">01:47:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a friend sit me down and say like, "Is there a piece of this that you can carve off and like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6430" target="_blank">01:47:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">build next week?" And so you're hearing a lot of tension. Interesting. And then so what was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6436" target="_blank">01:47:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the consequence of shipping Orbit out, I guess, before it felt ready to scale? I mean, I learned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6443" target="_blank">01:47:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">some things. It was fine. Like it taught me a lot about where that particular format succeeds and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6450" target="_blank">01:47:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">fails in other venues. It was just not a very effective way to find those things out. I built</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6457" target="_blank">01:47:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">this like very general... It was an MVP in the sense that it has very few features and it's very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6464" target="_blank">01:47:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">simple, but it was highly general. I mean, it's a deployed thing that has infrastructure, it has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6469" target="_blank">01:47:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">accounts, it has all this stuff that you do when you're building a real thing. And that's very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6475" target="_blank">01:47:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">different from like, "Well, let me work with this one author and see if I can make it work with this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6479" target="_blank">01:47:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">one other book." That's very different from Final Country. It's a form like a specific question or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6483" target="_blank">01:48:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">specific theory about like, "Well, it worked for this text.

And then to do that, I could potentially do it. I certainly could have done it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6494" target="_blank">01:48:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">much more rapidly.

I think it also feels very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6513" target="_blank">01:48:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">actionable for people in a way that's actually super misleading. I mean, so I meet tons and tons</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6519" target="_blank">01:48:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of people who tell me that they're interested in tools for thought and 95 plus percent of them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6525" target="_blank">01:48:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">are engineers. And the problem with this is that building an interesting tool for thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6531" target="_blank">01:48:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is basically entirely a design problem. And their design ideas are usually not very good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6538" target="_blank">01:48:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or are troubled in a variety of ways. And yet they can make a thing. They can make a thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6545" target="_blank">01:49:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that solves a problem maybe for them in their lives. And that feels very tantalizing or encouraging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6552" target="_blank">01:49:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It feels like something they get their hands around, I think. I think we in Silicon Valley</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6558" target="_blank">01:49:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">are very, very interested in thought. We are like a thinky people. And people are very interested</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6563" target="_blank">01:49:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and engaged also with anything that could potentially expand our capacity there. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6567" target="_blank">01:49:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that too is tantalizing. Like, what if I could think better? It's also tantalizing because it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6573" target="_blank">01:49:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">meta. So there's all these cliches about people tinkering with their dot files endlessly or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6579" target="_blank">01:49:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">tinkering with their blog website, which has two posts on it, but they have to rewrite it because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6585" target="_blank">01:49:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">they want to do something else.

Tools for thought also scratch that itch. It's work about the work. This sounds very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6595" target="_blank">01:49:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">cynical, by the way. I don't mean for it to be. I'm just trying to earnestly answer the question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6600" target="_blank">01:50:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But OK, here's a more optimistic and generous response. I think many of us got into computing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6608" target="_blank">01:50:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">because computers portray a sense of personal empowerment and possibility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6615" target="_blank">01:50:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">We maybe remember growing up and being locked in our bedrooms at midnight or whatever,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6621" target="_blank">01:50:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like fooling around. And we have this very powerful tool at our disposal. And it's opening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6627" target="_blank">01:50:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">up these worlds for us. And I think for many people here, that was like a formative part of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6633" target="_blank">01:50:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">their personal development. And so anybody pointing to that and saying we can we can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6639" target="_blank">01:50:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">more stuff like that is going to be pretty compelling. OK, this was an interesting question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6646" target="_blank">01:50:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">from Matt Clancy on Twitter. What are the characteristics of a good crowdfunded research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6652" target="_blank">01:50:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">project? One of the maybe unfortunate things that I've learned in my crowdfunding experience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6660" target="_blank">01:51:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is that there are some dynamics that seem hard to change. So one of them is a churn rate. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6668" target="_blank">01:51:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like any subscription kind of revenue business model, I guess that's what I have. You lose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6672" target="_blank">01:51:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">subscribers every month. In my case, it's about two percent. And it's not that large, but it does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6679" target="_blank">01:51:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">mean that I need a certain number of new subscribers all the time. And one thing I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6683" target="_blank">01:51:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">learned that's kind of interesting is that the churn rate is surprisingly insensitive to anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6687" target="_blank">01:51:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that I do.

In other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6698" target="_blank">01:51:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">words, marketing. And there are some things that have maybe affected like the fraction of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6704" target="_blank">01:51:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">people in the top of the funnel who convert or whatever.

In summary, the thing that I've discovered that's kind of sad is that I end up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6713" target="_blank">01:51:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">having to think about this a little bit. And in particular, I realize that this project only even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6719" target="_blank">01:51:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">slightly works, the one that I'm doing for crowdfunding, because it's understandable to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6723" target="_blank">01:52:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">others and it's interesting to others. And it's already in a place where, you know, there's some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6729" target="_blank">01:52:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">results that maybe look kind of promising or people are like, oh, more like that. But it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6734" target="_blank">01:52:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">very easy to imagine other projects that like are not broadly applicable. You know, if I were doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6740" target="_blank">01:52:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">marine geology stuff, I probably wouldn't have a big crowd of Internet people, not nearly as large</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6747" target="_blank">01:52:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">anyway. We're excited. So that's one property. This work is very general. It applies to many,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6752" target="_blank">01:52:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">many people. It applies to people who have disposable income. So if I were doing a research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6758" target="_blank">01:52:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">project on, I don't know, like writing practices of disadvantaged artists, like, I don't know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=6764" target="_blank">01:52:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like I think my audience might not have as much disposable income.

But there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7242" target="_blank">02:00:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">temptation to kind of portray what you found in the best possible light and to kind of downplay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7248" target="_blank">02:00:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">its limitations and to take up space and to totalize. And all of this is just, I think it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7258" target="_blank">02:00:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">just death for discovery. It is interesting to hear that from somebody who inadvertently and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7262" target="_blank">02:01:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">without intentionally trying to do so has done a good job of spreading your material. I've known</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7269" target="_blank">02:01:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">about you for a long time. But I do wonder if there's an element of, I think if you get to a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7273" target="_blank">02:01:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">certain level of quality after that, trying to market your stuff, not only doesn't help, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7278" target="_blank">02:01:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">probably hurts you. If you can try to think of somebody like, I don't know, Gorin trying to like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7283" target="_blank">02:01:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">post YouTube shorts of his blog posts or something like that. It would just be like, "What are you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7287" target="_blank">02:01:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">doing, man?" Right? It's just so good that he doesn't need to promote it. Gorin is an interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7292" target="_blank">02:01:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">example because there's a simpler failure mode. And that's that I still routinely run into people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7297" target="_blank">02:01:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">who will tell me like, "Oh, I've really liked your work for a while.

And I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7308" target="_blank">02:01:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Gorin actually has this even worse. I adore Gorin. I have learned so much from him. And it is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7318" target="_blank">02:01:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">case, you can go to his Patreon page and he actually makes public his revenue. He makes on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7323" target="_blank">02:02:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Patreon a tiny fraction of what I do.

Gorin is a much more impactful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7330" target="_blank">02:02:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">researcher than I am. And he has a much bigger audience than I do. So the fact that they aren't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7334" target="_blank">02:02:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">converting into Patreons, I think is mostly a matter of like the way that he talks about it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7340" target="_blank">02:02:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and the way that he presents it. And like, it's not that he needs to market more people to his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7345" target="_blank">02:02:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">webpage. I expect he has plenty of traffic and a plenty large audience. I think it's much larger</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7350" target="_blank">02:02:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">than mine. I think it's more just like, there are a bunch of variables about the way that you talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7355" target="_blank">02:02:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">about this membership offering.

Yeah, this is a really interesting problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7370" target="_blank">02:02:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">because I have a sub stack where if people choose, they can help contribute to the podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7376" target="_blank">02:02:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And while it's brought in enough revenue to help pay for certain episodes and traveling,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7382" target="_blank">02:03:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in comparison to now that I'm going to be doing ads, in comparison to what we'll be making in ads,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7386" target="_blank">02:03:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like a small fraction.

I do want to make one point though. I had much more success with my Patreon when I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7419" target="_blank">02:03:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">recast it as like, oh, please like support me, like subscribe to support my work, like the thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7425" target="_blank">02:03:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you were describing to something that I guess feels slightly more like, I don't know, an offering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7431" target="_blank">02:03:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like become a member. And like, when you become a member, like these things will happen. We're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7436" target="_blank">02:03:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like, these things are not terribly substantial necessarily. But I guess what I'm saying is like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7441" target="_blank">02:04:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a difference between a tip jar and a membership in people's minds. And like becoming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7447" target="_blank">02:04:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a member means something. And if you can offer something small, that feels membership-ish,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7453" target="_blank">02:04:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you might get very different results. And Gwern has the kind of tip jar vibe. And I these days</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7460" target="_blank">02:04:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">have kind of like a member vibe. And my instinct is that if you were to move to like a, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7465" target="_blank">02:04:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">become like a member of Gwern's lab kind of thing, he would have better results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7470" target="_blank">02:04:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, he has a thing on Patreon where it's like, if you donate five bucks or eight bucks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7474" target="_blank">02:04:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">he'll read an entire book and review it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7477" target="_blank">02:04:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, this is crazy.

I feel very conflicted about this, actually. Maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7505" target="_blank">02:05:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you can help me think about it. Well, I just, I have all these patron essays. It's like where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7510" target="_blank">02:05:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">most of my writing is these days, because I'm kind of waiting until I can collect enough things for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7517" target="_blank">02:05:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the next big public piece. I have a couple of like big public pieces in various stages of flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7522" target="_blank">02:05:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so anyway, I mean, I'm writing a lot for patrons and I think probably much of my audience</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7529" target="_blank">02:05:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">or people out there like don't even know that's there. So like one challenge of member only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7534" target="_blank">02:05:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">content is even making clear that it's there to others. And often people will try to achieve this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7540" target="_blank">02:05:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">by like tweeting about or sending newsletters out about this subscriber only content. And I just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7546" target="_blank">02:05:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">can't bring myself to do it. It feels terrible to say like, oh, here's a link, but you can't do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7552" target="_blank">02:05:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I can't, I can't do it. I don't know how you think about this or if you think about like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7556" target="_blank">02:05:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">subscriber only material for Lunar Society. I was actually just about to mention this to you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7561" target="_blank">02:06:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">which was, you know, I'm a patron and I got a chance to read all your patron only essays and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7568" target="_blank">02:06:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">they're great. And I was actually thinking while I was reading them, it's like really unfortunate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7572" target="_blank">02:06:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that a person might not know they exist or if they're not familiar enough with your work to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7577" target="_blank">02:06:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">ahead and sign up. It's just like behind the Patreon. So it's a shame that the way to fund</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7583" target="_blank">02:06:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">public work is, or one of the ways to fund public work is to make some of that work less public. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7588" target="_blank">02:06:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">think it would be, yeah, there was some way to make this. I think there are better ways to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7592" target="_blank">02:06:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this. I think there are like design solutions. So for instance, like if it were the case that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7599" target="_blank">02:06:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">my work was kind of mostly all in one place rather than in these separate places. And the subset of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7605" target="_blank">02:06:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the work that's public was kind of visually and structurally adjacent to the subset of the work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7610" target="_blank">02:06:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that's private. It would be clear that there's like this additional stuff that's available and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7615" target="_blank">02:06:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">perhaps you can see the first bit of it. You know, Substack has this kind of stuff as to get some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7619" target="_blank">02:06:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">sense of what it is that you'd be seeing. I just, I've invested like zero effort into figuring out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7625" target="_blank">02:07:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">an appropriate presentation of this stuff. Right. And also another thing to consider is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7629" target="_blank">02:07:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to the extent that this may not be the largest thing you care about, but it is a factor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7634" target="_blank">02:07:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is that a big part of the impact of at least your writing work. Well, one of the things in that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7639" target="_blank">02:07:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">equation is how many people actually consume it. Yeah. And the expected value on that is dominated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7644" target="_blank">02:07:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">by the probability goes viral. Sure. And it just can't go viral if it's on. Like, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7650" target="_blank">02:07:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I think your recent post on, you had this really insightful post based on your experience in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7654" target="_blank">02:07:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">industry at Apple about the possibilities of a vision pro and in what ways it's living up to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeRQN9z504&t=7661" target="_blank">02:07:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and not. And I think like that would have just. Oh, thanks. I mean, I did make it public.
