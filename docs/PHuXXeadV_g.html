So this brings me to my research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.220</a></span> | <span class="t">question. Is it feasible to perform an in-space inspection mission where you inspect a target</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.060</a></span> | <span class="t">satellite for the presence of a nuclear warhead on board? Daunting question. It has a lot of interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">technical and political facets to it, but for one particular aspect of it, I was able to use Claude</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">to my advantage. So I looked at specifically the feasibility of detecting the nuclear weapon with an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.900</a></span> | <span class="t">x-ray system. So you fly an x-ray source and detector on two different inspector satellites in space,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">have them rendezvous with the suspected nuclear warhead target, and scan it for the presence of a nuclear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.060</a></span> | <span class="t">weapon and board. I wanted to know if this would ever be possible. No one's ever tried using x-rays</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">in space. There are interesting questions around whether the space background environment is - there's too</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.820</a></span> | <span class="t">much noise in space to detect the source signal. So I built a computational simulation to see if this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">would ever be possible. And to do it, I used Claude. I used this very complicated CERN software package</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.740</a></span> | <span class="t">called giant4. I am not a particle physicist. I did not know how to approach this software package</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and write the C++ code. But I was able to make a desktop application to do my simulation using Claude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was incredibly exciting. It worked. So what you're seeing in this picture is like a very, very quick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">snapshot of an x-ray image taken in space. And you see a little hole in the middle that shows you that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.740</a></span> | <span class="t">there's very, very dense fissile material on board the target of the scan. So indeed, in this simulation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.340</a></span> | <span class="t">there was a simulated nuclear warhead on board the satellite target. The outcomes for this are pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">significant and interesting. There are a lot of people in the national security intelligence community in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">country that are interested in developing this kind of capability to inspect adversary spacecraft on orbit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">To understand their capabilities, particularly whether they might carry a weapon of mass destruction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So having done this research, I actually am going to be able to brief it in Washington, D.C. to some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.700</a></span> | <span class="t">policy makers at the Pentagon and state.

Let me show you a demo of something I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.540</a></span> | <span class="t">capable of doing now.

So, like, if this demo TypeScript file</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.300</a></span> | <span class="t">is referencing the batch results, that's where the line comes in.

So let me tell you guys about a big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">problem today, is AI embodiment. So we see like in Hacker News and the newest news all around that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">we're trying to create bots that interact with our world. And most recently, we have seen these robot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">dogs that are able to deliver you a water cup or something like that. But these systems do not compete</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.460</a></span> | <span class="t">with humans ourselves. Humans are like built to interact with our world. And that brings me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">to here, which is that today we have humans hiring AI agents to do their work for them. I'm sure all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.860</a></span> | <span class="t">you guys have probably employed some sort of AI agent to do your work for you. But today with SideQuest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.740</a></span> | <span class="t">we are flipping the script, we are flipping the script. And we have AI agents hiring humans to do their work for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">them. So AI agents obviously are amazing at interacting with the digital world. And humans are amazing at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">interacting with the physical world. So why can't these AI agents just hire the humans?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So that brings me to the architecture of SideQuest, which is basically, like, let me give you a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">hypothetical example. Let's say an AI agent is trying to host a hackathon. So now they have all the logistics</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.060</a></span> | <span class="t">covered, but they need to put some advertising material up. They need some flyers up so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">people can find out where this hackathon is, where to go. But they don't have any physical means to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So what they do is that they ping the nearest human to that area and tell them, "Oh, pick up this flyer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.260</a></span> | <span class="t">put it in this location, and livestream that video to me. And as soon as I can see that you did it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">then I'll give you money." So that's exactly what's happening in SideQuest, and I'll show you a short demo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Hello, world.

Let's do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It looks like there's a quest.

We're ready for the hackathon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep. And that's SideQuest. So let me talk a little bit about what I learned with building with Claude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that first, Claude is really smart, as with like any of these AI systems these days.

So we as humans, we don't need to prompt every little nitty-gritty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.140</a></span> | <span class="t">thing. We can start thinking about bigger picture parts of building products. Secondly, we should design</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">like with a back and forth workflow with these AI systems. Like originally, we are thinking like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.620</a></span> | <span class="t">upfront, oh, how should I build this whole big thing?

Knowing that Claude excels at complex reasoning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">as one of its most impressive capabilities, that's the gap that we aim to solve for our hackathon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Introducing Claude Cortex, a system designed to emulate a panel of experts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHuXXeadV_g&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">each analyzing the problem from a different angle.
