In this chapter we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=5" target="_blank">00:00:05.940</a></span> | <span class="t">to be taking a look at the built-in tracing that comes with the SDK. So just to give you a quick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=13" target="_blank">00:00:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">preview of what tracing looks like when you're using it, it looks like this. So this is all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=19" target="_blank">00:00:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">built-in. I haven't, or at least for most of these, I have not done anything much beyond passing in an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">API key. So this is one thing that Agents SDK does very well in my opinion. Just by passing my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">OpenAI API key and turning tracing on in my dashboard, and I'll show you how to do that in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.420</a></span> | <span class="t">moment, we get all of this information about what is going on within our Agents when we're using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Agents SDK. So this is an example from a future chapter that we are going to be working on, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">is where we're going to be building this essentially GFK RAG pipeline. And in this example we have this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">GFK document assistant. You can see that this is a chat response. So this is when we're getting the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">LLM to generate some text. In this case I can see that the LLM generated some text. It decided to use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the GFK file search tool. Here I must have been searching something to do with some guy here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Valerie. And we can see what was returned. Okay. And we also get to see how long each one of these steps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">took. So that initial tool call from the LLM is about a second. The response time there, super fast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it's about, well, 100 milliseconds there. Then the final response, the final response has a bit more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to process because we've just given it a ton of documents to read and it needs to respond. You can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">see that it went through and got all this input here and then the output was this. So that's pretty cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.740</a></span> | <span class="t">We have all that and you'll see it's super easy to sell. This is a pretty short chapter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So switching across to our code and make sure I'm using the agents SDK course environment there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">If you are in Colab, I will just pre-warn you that tracing doesn't work, at least not by default,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.980</a></span> | <span class="t">in Colab as of today. Maybe in the future it will, but if you do want to run this, you will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.100</a></span> | <span class="t">unfortunately just have to run this locally. You can't do this part in Colab. At least not right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">now. In the future, maybe you can. So we come down. If you are running this anywhere remotely,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">of course, you will need OpenAI agents. So that is to install. And the first thing I'm going to do is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.140</a></span> | <span class="t">just see how we set this up so that we can go into the OpenAI dashboard and see all these traces because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.900</a></span> | <span class="t">by default, if you're part of an organization, you can't. This information is by default only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">accessible by the organization owner. So if you're an engineer in a larger company, you will need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.100</a></span> | <span class="t">go through a few steps, which I have outlined here. So we first need to click that little settings icon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">at the top. We're then going to click on data controls. We should find a little section here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">which allows us to set the log visibility, right? And this includes traces. So you're looking at your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">response logs, stored, check completions, and traces. That will need to be set to be visible either to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone or visible for selected projects or just visible so that you as a engineer can see it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So once you have selected the required permissions there, you click save. Now, once you've gained access,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">you should actually be able to see traces already. And you can do so by going to your dashboard, go to traces,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you see here we have all of these traces. So you should be able to see this page. If you can't,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you need to talk to whoever owns your OpenAI organization and fix that. Once you've confirmed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">you can see everything. Let's switch back to the notebook, and we're going to start creating some traces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So we will need an OpenAI API key, of course. So you just enter that here. Then we're going to go ahead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and create a basic agent. Now, as usual, agent object will have that name instructions and model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You will see these in the tracing dashboard. Okay, so we're going to start with tracing prompt agent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.620</a></span> | <span class="t">speak like a pirate and the model there will be GT 4.1 nano. So we initialize that, come down to here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and we're going to say, write a one sentence poem. We run that. And what we should see, if we navigate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">back to our browser, click on the most recent trace, and we just see, okay, we've got that tracing prompt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">agent. So that's the agent name that we just created. And we can see what happened inside there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So it used 43 tokens. It used the 4.1 nano, and this is the April 14th model. The instructions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.820</a></span> | <span class="t">were speak like a pirate. Input from us, the user was write one sentence poem. And we can see the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.540</a></span> | <span class="t">assistant output there. So that is pretty self-explanatory. There's nothing, we literally did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.340</a></span> | <span class="t">nothing. We just entered our API key and it worked. So that's great, but there is a little more to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want to go through and we'll just see what else we can gather from traces or how we can even set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">our own custom traces. So starting with the custom traces, to customize our tracing, we use the trace</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">function from the agent's SDK library. And with this, we can add or modify any of the parameters that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">are tracking. And that will look a little like this. So we'll have this with trace and then we would have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.260</a></span> | <span class="t">any of our code that we want to trace here. And that doesn't necessarily actually even need to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">agent's SDK code, right? If you have a particular tool and there's something you want to track with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">that tool, you can, you can do that using this. Although that isn't necessarily the intended use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.940</a></span> | <span class="t">of the traces here. So let's come down a little bit and we're going to import that trace object.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm doing with trace, I'm setting the workflow name. So I can, I can do this. I can set a default name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to call this the prompt agent workflow. You can see that I'm setting a group ID here. So if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.980</a></span> | <span class="t">we want to group things together, we can do, I'm going to call this one agents SDK course tracing. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.940</a></span> | <span class="t">all of our, the traces we create in this little chapter, we can put under this group ID. And what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to do is run this. Okay. So I'm just running the same thing again, just within the trace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's run that. Switch over to our browser and we should see an update here. You can see the workflow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.700</a></span> | <span class="t">the name is changed, prompt agent workflow. Now by default, if you don't set the workflow name,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">it will just be agent workflow. If you do set the workflow name, this is what will appear, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Your custom workflow name. Now for all that other information, well, the group ID actually that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">added, we'd have to click in to here. We come across to details, I believe, and we can find a group ID</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">there. Okay. So that's that agents SDK course tracing. Now, if you come up here, you can also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.540</a></span> | <span class="t">search. So agents SDK course tracing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And now we can see, you know, I've done this a couple of times. So you can see all the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.020</a></span> | <span class="t">all of the cases where I have set my course or group ID, sorry, to be agents SDK course tracing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So I could go into here, go into details, and you can see that there as well. As well as that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">you can, as you can probably see here, search by the workflow name. So I've got web search agent. Let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.140</a></span> | <span class="t">look for that or filter for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Our filter for that, let's remove this filter and see how many of those we have probably. Oh, just three. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have three workflows where I set to web search agent. So you can, you can filter by that as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Now let's come down and let's have a look at how we would trace tools. So we are going to be using the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">web search tool from open AI. We're going to be providing this as a tool, obviously to a agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.500</a></span> | <span class="t">The agent's name will be tracing tool agent. Yeah. You can see that the instructions here are your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.460</a></span> | <span class="t">web search agent searches the web information on the user's queries. Okay. And we're using 4.1 mini here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Nano isn't supported for tool use or it's not recommended for tool use. So it's best to use mini there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Run that. And I'm going to say, what are the current world headlines? And this will usually come up with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.100</a></span> | <span class="t">something. Yeah. Yeah. Well, fun in, in, in some way. One thing that I will just know here is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.540</a></span> | <span class="t">look how long that took. Yes. It's very long web search with the built-in opening our web search tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I just wouldn't generally recommend it too much. It's slow, slow, and not that good. So it's fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.740</a></span> | <span class="t">You can use it, but I would use other tools if you can. So let's see what that looks like in our traces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So we have this agent workflow. That's the default name. So that must be it. Let's have a look.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Let's take a look in here. So we see, okay. It, there was the web search tool was used.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We can see, okay, user, what the current world headlines search the web. It has, okay. Middle East.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Ukraine. Ukraine. It opened a page for me. Okay. Back to this. International relations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.260</a></span> | <span class="t">natural disasters, science and technology list. That one's nice. Very cool. So, yep. I mean, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">world news. Lovely. That was actually better than a lot of the world. That's actually not bad for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.740</a></span> | <span class="t">OpenAI web search. A lot of time, I get a lot of rubbish from it. So it could be worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, we can see what happened there. Oh, and this is just the output, right? So this is like a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">big response that we got from our agent with a ton of sources, ton of information. So really not too bad,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.940</a></span> | <span class="t">actually. Even for that 13 seconds, I suppose. It could be, it could be worse. It could also be better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So we can come down now. What, you know, what we just saw is that we had the, it was just called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">the tracing tool agent. Maybe what we'd like to do is actually give that a more, the workflow a more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">specific name. So in this case, we're going to call it that web search agent. It's what we saw before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm also going to add metadata. Okay. So we can add metadata in here to, well, we can, we can search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">or filter based on that metadata. I'll show you that in a moment. So let's run this and jump across</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">to our browser. So we can see, we have the website agent workflow in here. Okay. It's, I think it's still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">running if I'm no, no, no, it has. Oh, that was, it was quite fast that time. So 6.6 seconds. And yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.140</a></span> | <span class="t">we got, we'll get more news there. The, we can look in the details. We have group ID. We can see metadata</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.700</a></span> | <span class="t">here and we can filter by that metadata. So if I go into here and I write tools, web search tool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">and we can see all of the cases where that metadata has been added. So you can, you'd add a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">various metadata in that, whatever you need basically, which is, is really helpful. Great. So that is our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.780</a></span> | <span class="t">quick introduction to the agent's SDK tracing. As I think you've seen, it's pretty useful and it requires</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.980</a></span> | <span class="t">minimal setup on our side. We, you know, we kind of went in there, we're using the, the trace context,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.020</a></span> | <span class="t">but you don't even need to do that. It's I, I honestly, I pro in most projects, I probably wouldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">do that. I would just set my API key, allow the traces to be collected and go and review them when I need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.180</a></span> | <span class="t">review them, which I think is just really helpful. Now, that is it for this chapter. It's a quick one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So I will see you in the next one. Thanks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Bye.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Bye.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Bye.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Bye.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Bye.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Bye.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ytN20H-BQ&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you</span></div></div></body></html>
