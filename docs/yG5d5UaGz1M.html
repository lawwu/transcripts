Wow, okay. Engineering, UX. Okay, I feel like there is definitely some overlap there, right? But that's exactly what we're seeing happen right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=28" target="_blank">00:00:28.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Sorry, I have to keep walking over here because I'm so short. If I stand here, I can't see you. But what's crazy is I feel like we're all doing all the jobs now, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like that's the crazy thing about AI. That's the crazy thing about right now. And I wonder how much longer it's going to be relevant for to ask, you know, what do you do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.220</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you do at your company? Because chances are you're probably doing everything. And you can, right? With some ease. And so I think a lot of questions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">people ask me this all the time. Students in particular ask me this all the time. So what does product do, like, in this new world?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the way that I think about product is kind of like a multi-layer cake. And I think that it starts with how we think about ourselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And I know this is like kind of a weird topic. It's like not super technical, but I think it's probably one of the most important,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">which is I remember when it was considered technical to be the type of PM that could write your own SQL queries, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, if I said that to you now, like, it's kind of silly because everybody knows how to write their own SQL queries because chat GPT does, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, all you have to do is to know what question you're asking and then you can do it, right? But it's not just like these little tasks that you can do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's also like the entire roles themselves that are changing because it's easier than ever to access expertise or simulate it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So in a world where the jobs are blending together, I feel like it's even more important to understand, you know, where are you coming from?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the value that you bring, you know, coming from yourself? And then there's this other thing that's really interesting that's happening,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.180</a></span> | <span class="t">which is teams are becoming drastically reconfigured. And even at like a super basic level, like if you think about it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">every team now has a bunch of like invisible participants, right? Like every doc, every slide, every little bit of thing that is passed around or created,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">there's like a chat GPT or a Claude or a Gemini behind that thing, right? Like most of the time, even when I read something like with my own raw eyeballs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll still give it to chat GPT and be like, what did I miss? Right? Like, here's my takeaways. What's yours? And that's crazy because teams are now fully augmented, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We've got like five people on a team and we've got five chat GPTs. And that's crazy. We don't really know what that means, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But we've got superpowers now. How are we going to use it? And then there's this layer, which I think is like super interesting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">which is this is where the title slide comes from, where I think products come from people, like deep within people, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You pull an idea out of yourself and you translate it into technology and that's what a product is. But when you look at every product that we are using,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">you can tell we are in the clunky, awkward years, right? You can tell everything is about to change. And literally everything we are using is the ugliest that it will ever be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Because everything we use was created in like the pre AI era where, you know, we had to imagine, well, how do I make this thing work? Like if I press this button, like it makes a J on my screen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like now it feels like kind of strange. Like when you think about the richness of like the interactions that are possible, it now feels kind of strange to use like an everyday thing like a microwave or maybe it's just me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe I'm the only one who wants like an AI microwave, right? Or whatever, whatever that thing does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think what I'm trying to say is like, we're starting to assemble the shapes of what we think AI is really capable of and what it can deliver.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that the best products out there haven't been discovered yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">How do we discover it? Well, I think the answer lies in the final layer and sort of typically, right, what a product manager would say, I think it's in the user layer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I mean by this is, I don't know if you all have noticed it, but there is this kind of like consumer unrest, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Where as we use products like ChatGPT, Cursor, Claude, right, you start to see, well, it's super easy to use this shit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just like I have to say what I want and something magical comes back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And now I have to go use the rest of this dumb thing, like dumb products out there that don't do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you have a little bit of this chasm now where you have these super powerful, really intuitive, really smart products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And you have the rest of the world, which is just like janky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that what we're going to see is that there's going to be a phase where everything gets rebuilt, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So how should we think about rebuilding?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, first of all, I think we should not undersell the fact that there is a lot of chaos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like all the time, I think I try to emphasize this to people, even though things are like really cool and pretty magical,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">it's also pretty fucking hard because each of these layers is being effectively rewritten.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is not without cost, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like even the first question I asked was like, hey, what do you do for a living?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it's kind of weird.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it's really uncomfortable to be like, I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, are they still going to be hiring product managers next year?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Not sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Engineers?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Dunno.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Designers?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And that unrest lives inside of us at each of these layers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's crazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I started out this spiel asking, you know, what is the role of product?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And ultimately, I think that complementary to chaos is always opportunity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And our job is product people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't say product managers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think just like whoever you are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if you embody sort of like the force behind a product, this applies to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Your job is to find the nugget of opportunity out there and explode it like a popcorn kernel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like that is your singular job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it's actually kind of exciting if you work at an organization where every person embraces this mission.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So my talk is largely about this opportunity and how I think you should go about exploding it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there are a lot of talks that you could attend that tell you sort of practically how to, you know, technically build products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But like, I really want to talk through sort of the principles that I use to drive product building.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's jump in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">What does it take to build a great AI product?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think first I want to acknowledge that for folks who have shipped things, especially, you know, if you're part of a team or a company, I think that building a product is a forceful experience.</span></div><div

here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually first was like, I think it's a violent experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And my team was like, I don't know if you can say that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.180</a></span> | <span

people don't know if like a tech job is violent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.180</a></span> | <span

say that is I think that you almost have to force a product into existence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't mean sort of like the hobby stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I mean to truly build something that can meaningfully exist as a product that has a place in people's lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like that takes a lot of force.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that to do that, to do that particularly well, you need a lot of personal clarity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's like, it's like this thing that is inside of like an individual person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes we talk about clarity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I don't think that's where it starts.</span></div><div class="c"><span

like carries this clarity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div

and the why of it, that's real energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think when people talk about technology, we're always talking about technology, tech, the stack, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think everything we are talking about is just a transformed energy that comes from people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so ultimately, this personal clarity is what's going to give you the energy to push your team,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">to push your stakeholders, and to push your users because it's like, it's really hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And your primary role is just to cultivate that relentlessly.</span></div><div

purpose, and the clarity of taste, which I'll talk more about in just a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=537"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, this was the first version of Notebook LM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It was called Tailwind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We announced it at Google I/O in 2023.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I will never forget the road to get to this thing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I think the amount of people that told me it was stupid was actually, like, fascinatingly high.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was really great that I was like, whoa, I think it might actually be stupid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's like that force, right, that personal clarity that gave me the energy to keep driving forward with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And in reality, the reason why I had so much personal clarity, I don't think a lot of people know this, but I had dropped out of college.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I went back to school full time when I was working at Google.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I was full time in college, I was full time building Notebook LM, and I was like, I don't know how else to explain this to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But if I could just have a tool where I put a bunch of shit in it, right, like just a bunch of docs, a bunch of slides, and I just chat with it, and it does something for me, that seems really valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I've never been able to do that before, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not just bolting it on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I want to build this thing from the ground up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so every time somebody would tell me it was stupid, whether it was a user, a stakeholder, teammates even, would be like, I don't understand, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say, no, I do, though, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I get it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I know why this thing is important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so personal clarity will get you far.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And it will get your team far.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I highly recommend starting from this place of just, like, cultivating this energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.180</a></span> | <span

clarity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Great.</span></div><div

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think that the first thing that I always tell people to do is you have to start with the job and not the pixels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Because when we talk about taste, I think sometimes people feel that that it's about an aesthetic thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But I actually think it's about an outcome, right?</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:11:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, that is purpose, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=667"

| <span class="t">And it was really hard to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It was really hard for UX reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It was really hard for sort of the actual way that we were able to generate this in a smart way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But the trade-off is that once we built this auto-summary into Notebook LM, it made it so much easier for people to understand a really foreign concept at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is like the concept that I would put 50 files in one place and I would interact with it in this different way that we hadn't really done before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It was like a little token feature that was both a tutorial and was useful at a glance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's like you could not have arrived at this type of idea, which looks really basic, just like from the outside of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You could not have arrived at it if you were not sort of obsessively trying to drive at, like, the value that you're trying to deliver to somebody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, I think that when we think about the value and what we're trying to give to users, I think that in reality, the value of a product is a promise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, ultimately, any product is a promise to a user and you're making claims about what it can do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So then the user tries it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But trust is oxygen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And using a product is like a transaction between the user and the company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And without it, you're nothing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You have, like, a pretty limited credit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, most products get a credit of, like, negative one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Because not everybody's going to want to try your shit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, like, the person that does, like, they don't have the patience for whatever things you put in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">They only have patience for one thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, I think one of the best ways that you can actually build trust is to expose the edges.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Show people where the model is dumb and make it seamless between the user and the product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, don't paper over it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Because even though we have these really smart, incredible models, the way that we are building them is still, like, a very human type of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when you give a product to a person, you are exposing your own process, your own thought process, your own workflow to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're making a promise about how it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, when it fails, when it doesn't work, think about how you go about it in the most human way possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I see this all the time where people are trying to instrument for, like, the best use case but not the worst case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you kind of have this, like, weird half-baked product in space where it's purely machine and very little human involved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, on this note, I want to say something that sounds really dumb and basic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think that you have to nail the deterministic things before the delightful probabilistic bits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Because at the end of the day, a good app is still just a really good app.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it's just an app, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's like, it doesn't matter what you jam in there, it's still an app.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is another one of, like, sort of the older user interfaces we had in Notebook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But users routinely would do this thing where they would upload sources and they would enter a query like summarize this doc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Summarize this doc and this doc only.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Summarize only this concept.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was very hard to do in the early days of Notebook LM, particularly with the smaller context windows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things that we saw was the query type for summarization was, like, in terms of, like, the percent of, like, first queries, it was, like, 90%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">90% of, like, users, their first query was a summarization query.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was this testing behavior, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">People were trying it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">They were like, oh, I heard about this thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, saw the website, cool, I'm gonna upload a thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, think about all the steps the user went through to get there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">User gets there, they upload something, enter summarize, and it borks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It didn't work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So the user leaves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">They leave forever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But, like, think about, like, the amount of time that, like, that person put into it because you made a promise to them that it was gonna do exactly that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think that one of the things I want to say about trust is it's not cheap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not cheap, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">If you get a user to try your product, make it as good as fucking possible the first time because they're not gonna come back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, it was, like, so detrimental, this summarization use case, that it was, like, all I thought about for a very long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so let's say you manage to earn the trust of your users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You've got a bunch of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">They love it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And really, to be honest with you, in real life, right, like, this flow that we're describing, it's actually, like, a matter of seconds for a person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.180</a></span> | <span class="t">This is, like, one minute, right, for you to deliver on this whole thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But you get to earn the next thing after you have trust, which is the potential to delight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think with Notebook this was, like, really cool where I feel like the delightfulness was that it was unexpected and it was kind of funny.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Where people would upload documents and then they would make a podcast and they were like, I don't know what it's going to say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it could be kind of goofy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It could be pretty funny.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think there's, like, an aspect in there that is, like, just very playful, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, delightfulness is almost -- it's very similar to playfulness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And it sort of lives, I think, in this interesting space between technical capabilities and user expectations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it's, like, you kind of have to meet users where they are, but you have to push them just a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, where once you've built trust, you can push just one step past what's familiar and not spook anybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1085" target="_blank">00:18:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I think we've seen this too, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, when things are, like, too weird, it's, like, spooky and people are like, I don't know, I'm not going to look at it anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like people felt this way about robots for a long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1094" target="_blank">00:18:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think that in reality, kind of just going back to the trust piece, we get one chance to really make the machine feel like magic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so my tip here is actually just, like, a very, like, kind of a tactical one, which is, I think you need to surface delightfulness through agency and not trickery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1113" target="_blank">00:18:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Where it's, like, the user has to feel like they are a part of it, that they are steering, and it feels self-directed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1119" target="_blank">00:18:39.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was one of the big things about notebook.lm, which was, like, it wasn't, like, a random button, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1124" target="_blank">00:18:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It was, like, I knew the specific document I had uploaded, I knew that it was going to make something magical for me, but it felt like equal parts me and the machine, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1134" target="_blank">00:18:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it felt like there was, like, a healthy tension between there where the machine had a real opportunity to delight me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1140" target="_blank">00:19:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not going to show an example here in particular, but I want to make a point about delightfulness, which is, it is actually really hard to delight people if you're doing too much shit, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1150" target="_blank">00:19:10.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I really think that you're either shipping model capabilities or actual new outcomes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1156" target="_blank">00:19:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">There is no real in-between here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1158" target="_blank">00:19:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is where, sort of, like, the stack will come to kind of haunt you, where do you know the outcome that you are optimizing for?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you know how the user is supposed to get there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you know what is preventing users from getting there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1171" target="_blank">00:19:31.180</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:19:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think these are sort of, like, kind of deep, gnarly questions, and it's just, like, something that you will only get to by using the product a lot yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that that is the way to build a delightful product, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Is to not test your product, but to sort of live and breathe it and live the life of your users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, who do you think is going to use this thing?</span></div><div class="c"><span

person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Because that's the only way that I think you can start to feel at the borders of what people are ready for and what the technology is capable of, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's ultimately, like, the little trick to getting within that space and building something interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, finally, I think that Delight shows us what the product can do and what's magical about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think what a lot of people are not actually as judicious about is what it should do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1229" target="_blank">00:20:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is kind of, like, a weird piece of advice, especially because, like, I've made this mistake many, many, many times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1235" target="_blank">00:20:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I only say this from sort of the tried and tested experience of being a kitchen sink person, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've all used products like this where, when you look around you, there's plenty of examples where it kind of feels like you have not shipped your POV on the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1250" target="_blank">00:20:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You actually just shipped a kitchen sink of model capabilities with your slight flare on it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1255" target="_blank">00:20:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, maybe you changed the color.</span></div><div class="c"><span

still living in the era of, like, research previews.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1262" target="_blank">00:21:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it's cool to know what the models can do, like, it's ever increasing in capability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think, like, to true end users, like, it's probably not that interesting, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Because that is just ChatGPT. Like, I'll just use ChatGPT.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1273" target="_blank">00:21:13.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think you're gonna do a better job than them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's probably not right to jam everything in there and try to see what's sticking with who, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1283" target="_blank">00:21:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So the barrier to shipping, especially nowadays, it's not about the capability, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's about judgment. And the thing that I try to ask myself is, you know, does this product respect user time, data, and agency?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I really believe that restraint in particular, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a new innovation multiplier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1305" target="_blank">00:21:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, if you yourself have that personal clarity, you have that purpose, and you are focused, you're driven, you're resilient, like, 100%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1312" target="_blank">00:21:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">People are gonna tell you stuff like, "Well, this is, like, the simplest thing ever. How do you aim to compete?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, exactly, by being focused, right? By doing one thing incredibly reasonably well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1323" target="_blank">00:22:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And you will get to a point where the thing is so excellent that you are beginning to really delight people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1329" target="_blank">00:22:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you will have more of an intuition about the borders that I was talking about in the previous slide.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1334" target="_blank">00:22:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one last note I'll say on delightfulness is that -- I mean, on the kitchen sink -- is that users are not that different from you or me, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, we are all users of something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1346" target="_blank">00:22:26.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so think about the last time you tried something new.</span></div><div

it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1351" target="_blank">00:22:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And think about how annoying it was when you tried it, and you're like, "I just don't know what I would do with this thing."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1356"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1360" target="_blank">00:22:40.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's just, like, what happens when you sort of let the chaos overwhelm you, and you're not clear about what the whole point of, like, your thing is, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1368"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, if you yourself don't know what you're trying to do with yourself, then you don't know what to do with your product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1379" target="_blank">00:22:59.180</a></span> | <span

like, the lack of focus in the product direction, it's like, hey, this has a little bit of, like, that demo disease, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1463" target="_blank">00:24:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Where it looks cool, but in real life, like, nobody's going to love that thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1467" target="_blank">00:24:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I just want to reiterate kind of the message here, which is clarity is what is going to give you the energy for the job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1473"

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1482" target="_blank">00:24:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And it is the trust in that purpose that's going to earn us the belief, right, of our users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1488" target="_blank">00:24:48.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And the belief is

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1496" target="_blank">00:24:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And the kitchen sink is just like a checks and balances kind of a thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1499" target="_blank">00:24:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And it keeps us honest and focused about whether or not meeting the first four.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's how I believe that we build something that isn't ugly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5d5UaGz1M&t=1507"
