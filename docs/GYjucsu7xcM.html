So every conversation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjucsu7xcM&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you engage in, every person you meet, the goal is to have, say something, say something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjucsu7xcM&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">that leaves behind a good word for the Lord, say something that makes Christ attractive,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjucsu7xcM&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and try to get an opportunity to pray with people. That's a really big thing in my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjucsu7xcM&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I always teach my theological students that praying with people is the most important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjucsu7xcM&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">thing you can do when you pour out your heart for their spiritual welfare, whether they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjucsu7xcM&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">believer or unbeliever.

So I've had a principle in my study of all the visitors. If anyone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjucsu7xcM&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">wants to talk to me about something more than one or two minutes, I'll say, "Sit down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjucsu7xcM&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to pray first." And I say, "You pray at the beginning. I'll pray at the end."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjucsu7xcM&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want to not just bookend everything with prayer, but to me prayer is of the essence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjucsu7xcM&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.820</a></span> | <span class="t">of doing missions, because we can't convert anyone. And I think the Puritans would say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjucsu7xcM&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">the same thing. Thomas Watson, for example, says, "We proclaim Christ, but it's the Holy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjucsu7xcM&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Spirit that takes the key of preaching and unlocks the heart of man, which we cannot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjucsu7xcM&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">do." So I think the passion for souls comes when we understand, as we've been hearing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjucsu7xcM&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.620</a></span> | <span class="t">all conference long, what a wonder it is that we are saved. And it's like those men, I forget,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjucsu7xcM&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">from Samaria or whatever, who went out and, you know, the enemy was completely gone and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjucsu7xcM&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">they found all these spoils and they started feasting, gorging themselves. And then they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjucsu7xcM&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">said, "Wait a minute. We can't feast on all these things and not go back and tell Israel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjucsu7xcM&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">that the enemy is defeated." And that's what we need to do with our lives. We just need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjucsu7xcM&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">to...if we really believe that we have the one truth that the whole world needs, we got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjucsu7xcM&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.220</a></span> | <span class="t">to share it with the whole world as much as possible. So that's why I get up every morning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjucsu7xcM&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.900</a></span> | <span class="t">and one of my secret prayers every morning is, "Lord, help me to be in connection with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYjucsu7xcM&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">someone today that needs to hear the gospel.
