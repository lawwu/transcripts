And they did basically the math and the number of customization options on their car were like more than the atoms in the universe.</p><p>Basically just there's so many different options. So like all the different permutations, you can obviously customize a house just a huge amount just by like the appliances that you have and the finishes that are in there and the paint colors that you choose and the fixtures and stuff like that.</p><p>It would not really change theoretically the underlying way the building goes together. So I do think that that idea that the sort of fundamental demand for variety is a major obstruction. I feel I do not think there's a whole lot of evidence for that in the construction industry.</p></div></div></body></html>
