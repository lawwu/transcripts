Luis, you suggested an interesting idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Imagine if most papers had a backstory section, the same way that they have an abstract. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">knowing more about how the authors ended up working on a paper can be extremely insightful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you went on to give a backstory for the Feynman QED paper. This is all in a tweet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">by the way. We're doing tweet analysis today. How much of the human backstory do you think is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">important in understanding the idea itself that's presented in the paper or in general?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">- I think this gives way more context to the work of scientists. I think a lot of people have this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">almost kind of romantic misconception that the way a lot of scientists work is almost as the sum of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">eureka moments where all of a sudden they sit down and start writing two papers in a row,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and the papers are usually isolated. And when you actually look at it, the papers are chapters of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">way more complex story. And the Feynman QED paper is a good example. So, Feynman was actually going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">through a pretty dark phase before writing that paper. He lost enthusiasm with physics and doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">physics problems. And there was one time when he was in the cafeteria of Cornell, and he saw a guy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that was throwing plates in the air. And he noticed that when the plate was in the air, there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">were two movements there. The plate was wobbling, but he also noticed that the Cornell symbol was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">rotating. And he was able to figure out the equations of motions of those plates. And that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">led him to kind of think a little bit about electron orbits in relativity, which led to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">about quantum electrodynamics. So, that kind of reignited his interest in physics,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and ended up publishing the paper that led to his Nobel Prize, basically. And I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">there are a lot of really interesting backstories about papers that readers never get to know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">For instance, we did a couple of months ago an AMA around a paper, a pretty famous paper,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the Gans paper with Ian Goodfellow. And so, we did an AMA where everyone could ask questions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">about the paper, and Ian was responding to those questions. He was also telling the story of how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">he got the idea for that paper in a bar. So, that was also an interesting backstory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I also read a book by Cedric Villani. Cedric Villani is this mathematician, a Fields Medalist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And in his book, he tries to explain how he got from a PhD student to the Fields Medal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and he tries to be as descriptive as possible, every single step, how he got to the Fields Medal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's interesting also to see just the amount of random interactions and discussions with other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">researchers, sometimes over coffee, and how it led to fundamental breakthroughs in some of his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">most important papers. So, I think it's super interesting to have that context of the backstory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">- Well, the Ian Goodfellow story is kind of interesting, and perhaps that's true for Feynman</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">as well. I don't know if it's romanticizing the thing, but it seems like just a few little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">insights and a little bit of work does most of the leap required. Do you have a sense that for a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of the stuff you've looked at, just looking back through history, it wasn't necessarily the grind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of like Andrew Wiles or the Fermat's Last Theorem, for example. It was more like a brilliant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">moment of insight. In fact, Ian Goodfellow has a kind of sadness to him almost, in that at that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">time in machine learning, like at that time, especially for GANs, you could code something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">up really quickly on a single machine and almost do the invention, go from idea to experimental</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">validation in like a single night, a single person could do it. And now there's kind of a sadness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that a lot of the breakthroughs you might have in machine learning kind of require large scale</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">experiments. So it was almost like the early days. So I wonder how many low hanging fruit there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">in science and mathematics and even engineering where it's like, you could do that little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">experiment quickly. Like you have an insight in a bar. Why is it always a bar? But you have an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">insight at a bar and then just implement and the world changes. It's a good point. I think it also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">depends a lot on the maturity of the field. When you look at a field like mathematics,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like it's a pretty mature field. A field like machine learning, it's growing pretty fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's actually pretty interesting. I looked up like the number of new papers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">on archive with the keyword machine learning and like 50% of those papers have been published</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in the last 12 months. So you can see just the sense-</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Five zero?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Five zero, 50%. So you can see the magnitude of growth in that field. And so I think like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">as fields mature, like those types of moments, I think naturally are less frequent. It's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a consequence of that. The other point that is interesting about the backstory is that it can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">really make it more memorable in a way.

I remember also reading the sort of the backstory to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, right? Where he came up with it essentially while he was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">sitting down at a coffee shop in Amsterdam.

And so he had to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it all in his mind.

Newton is a good example also to think about his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">backstory because there's a certain backstory of Newton that people always talk about, but then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a whole another aspect of him that is also a big part of the person that he was. But he was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">really into alchemy. And he spent a lot of time thinking about that and writing about it. And he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">took it very seriously.

So I converted the picture into a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">bunch of one and eights, and then I moved some numbers around until it was a prime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I sent him that. - Oh, so the visual, like it still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">looked like the picture, it was made up of a prime.

That's hard to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">- It looks harder than it actually is.

And then there's- - And then you just keep flipping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">numbers until- - Yeah, but there's like some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">primality tests that are cheaper from a computational standpoint. But what it tells you is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it excludes numbers that are not prime.

And then you run the full primality test on that. So you just have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to keep iterating on that. And it's funny because when he got the picture, he was like, "How did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you do that?" He was super curious too. And then we got into the details. And again, it was already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">90, I think 92 or something.

And so academic papers can be one of the densest forms of content out there and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">generally pretty hard to understand at times. And the idea is that you can make them more accessible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1058" target="_blank">00:17:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and easier to understand by adding these rich annotations to the side. And so we can just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">imagine a PDF view on your browser, and then you have annotations on each side. And then when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">click on them, a sidebar expands and then you have annotations that support LaTeX and Markdown.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the idea is that you can say, explain a tougher part of a paper where there's a step</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that is not completely obvious, or you can add more context to it. And then over time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1085" target="_blank">00:18:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">papers can become easier and easier to understand and can evolve in a way.

And then we tried to bring some of that online.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's when we decided to build Fermat's library. And then over time, it kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1119" target="_blank">00:18:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">grew into something with a broader goal. And really what we're trying to do is trying to help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">move science in the right direction.

So collaboration, annotations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1695" target="_blank">00:28:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">like having other things apart from papers like code and other things.

And there's a process where, how would you summarize the peer review process,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1885" target="_blank">00:31:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's really just like a handful of people look over your paper and comment and based on that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1891" target="_blank">00:31:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">decide whether your paper is good or not.

At the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1897" target="_blank">00:31:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">time, I love the peer review process when I buy stuff on Amazon, for like the commenting system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1906" target="_blank">00:31:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever that is.

And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1911" target="_blank">00:31:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">there's the other side, which is the collaborative aspect of the science, which is people annotating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1916" target="_blank">00:31:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">people commenting sort of the low effort collaboration, which is a comment.

The simplicity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1976" target="_blank">00:32:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">of it is a feature. It feels like it's a bug. But then again, the pushback there is Wikipedia has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1985" target="_blank">00:33:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the same kind of simplicity to it.

So, sorry, there's a bunch of stuff going on on the table. Let's just pick random</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=1998" target="_blank">00:33:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">things that we can talk about. - Wikipedia, for me, it's the cosmological constant of the internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2004" target="_blank">00:33:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we are lucky to live in the parallel universe where Wikipedia exists.

And so I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2231" target="_blank">00:37:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">confident that there are other avenues that could be explored here. - Can we talk about peer review,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2235" target="_blank">00:37:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">for example? - Absolutely. I think like in terms of the peer review, I think it's important to look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2242" target="_blank">00:37:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">at the bigger picture here of like, of what the scientific publishing ecosystem looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2250" target="_blank">00:37:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Because for me, there are a lot of things that are wrong about that entire process.

So this is, for me, it's bizarre. You have the government that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2312" target="_blank">00:38:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">funding the research, is paying the salaries of the scientists, is paying the salaries of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2316" target="_blank">00:38:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">reviewers, and it's buying back all that product of their work again. And I think the problem with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2323" target="_blank">00:38:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">this system, and it's why it's so difficult to break this suboptimal equilibrium, is because of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2331" target="_blank">00:38:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the way academia works right now and the way you can progress in your academic life.

In computer science, it's often conferences that are also very prestigious, or actually more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2368" target="_blank">00:39:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">prestigious than journals now. Okay, interesting. So that's the one discipline where, I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2373" target="_blank">00:39:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that has to do with the thing we've discussed in terms of how quickly the field turns around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2378" target="_blank">00:39:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But like, NeurIPS, CVPR, those conferences are more prestigious, or at the very least,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2385" target="_blank">00:39:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">as prestigious as the journals. But yeah, but doesn't matter. The process is what it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2389" target="_blank">00:39:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So for people that don't know, the impact factor of a journal is basically the average number of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2396" target="_blank">00:39:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">citations that a paper would get if it gets published on that journal.

And let me unpack this, because the impact factor is almost like a nobility title.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2418" target="_blank">00:40:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So because papers are born with impact, even before anyone reads them. So the researchers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2424" target="_blank">00:40:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">they don't have the incentive to care about if this paper is going to ever have a long-term impact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2431" target="_blank">00:40:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">on the world.

And that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2442" target="_blank">00:40:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">really creates a tyranny of metrics.

So what they wanted to create was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2509" target="_blank">00:41:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a map.

So citations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2516" target="_blank">00:41:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">would be links between papers.

And so they end up publishing as many papers as they can in journals with low impact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2629" target="_blank">00:43:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">factor. And unfortunately, this represents a lot of the global South. And then you have the luxury</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=2637" target="_blank">00:43:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">good economy.

So it's very random.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4570" target="_blank">01:16:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So this, okay, so what's interesting about this tunnel? So this tunnel was built in the 6th</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4578" target="_blank">01:16:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">century BC and it was built in the island of Samos, which is, as I said, off the coast of Turkey.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4587" target="_blank">01:16:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And they had the city on one side and the other mountain, and then they had a bunch of springs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4594" target="_blank">01:16:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">on the other side and they wanted to bring water into the city. Building an aqueduct would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4600" target="_blank">01:16:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty hard because of the way the mountain was shaped. And it would also, if they were under a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4605" target="_blank">01:16:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">siege, they could just easily destroy that aqueduct and then the water wouldn't have any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4611" target="_blank">01:16:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">water supply, the city wouldn't have any water supply. And so they decided to build a tunnel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4616" target="_blank">01:16:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and they decided to try to do it quickly. And so they started digging from both ends at the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4627" target="_blank">01:17:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">time through the mountain. And so when you start thinking about this, it's a fairly difficult</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4634" target="_blank">01:17:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">problem. And this is like 6th century BC. So you had very limited access to the mathematical tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4642" target="_blank">01:17:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that you had at the time were very limited. And so what this paper is about is about the story</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4647" target="_blank">01:17:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of how they built it and about the fact that for about 2000 years, the accepted explanation of how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4655" target="_blank">01:17:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">they built it was actually wrong. And so this tunnel has been famous for a while. There are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4660" target="_blank">01:17:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a number of historians that talked about it since ancient Egypt. And the method that they described</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4666" target="_blank">01:17:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">for building it was just wrong. And so these researchers went there and were able to figure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4677" target="_blank">01:17:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that out. And so basically, kind of the way that they thought they had built it was basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4682" target="_blank">01:18:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">if you can imagine looking at the mountain from the top and you have the mountain, then you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4687" target="_blank">01:18:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">both entrances. And so what they thought, and this is what the ancient historians described,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4694" target="_blank">01:18:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is that they effectively tried to draw a right angle triangle with the two entrances at each end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4704" target="_blank">01:18:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of the hypotenuse. And the way they did is like they would go around the mountain and kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4709" target="_blank">01:18:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">walking in a grid fashion. And then you can figure out the two sides of the triangle. And then after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4716" target="_blank">01:18:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you have that triangle, you can effectively draw two smaller triangles at each entrance that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4723" target="_blank">01:18:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">proportional to that big triangle. And then you kind of have arrows pointing in each way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4729" target="_blank">01:18:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you know at least that you have a line going through the mountain that connects</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4736" target="_blank">01:18:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">both entrances. The issue with that is like, once you go to this mountain and you start thinking of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4743" target="_blank">01:19:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">doing this, you realize that, especially given that the tools that they had at the time, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4748" target="_blank">01:19:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">your error margin would be too small. You wouldn't be able to do it. Just the fact of trying to build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4757" target="_blank">01:19:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">this triangle in that fashion, the error would accumulate and you would end up missing. You'd</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4762" target="_blank">01:19:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">start building these tunnels and they would miss each other. - So the task ultimately is to figure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4766" target="_blank">01:19:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">out like really perfectly, as close as possible, the direction you should be digging. First of all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4771" target="_blank">01:19:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that it's possible to have a straight line through and then what that direction would be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4777" target="_blank">01:19:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you are trying to infer that by constructing a right triangle. I'm not exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4784" target="_blank">01:19:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">sure about how to do that rigorously, like by tracing the mountain, by walking along the mountain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4790" target="_blank">01:19:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You said grids? - Yeah, you kind of walk as if you were in a grid and so you just walk in right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4796" target="_blank">01:19:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">angles. - But then you have to walk really precisely then. You have to use tools to measure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4802" target="_blank">01:20:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">this and the terrain is probably a mess. So this makes more sense in 2D and 3D gets even weirder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4809" target="_blank">01:20:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, okay, gotcha. - But so this method was described by an ancient Egyptian historian,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4816" target="_blank">01:20:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, Hero of Alexandria. And then for about 2000 years, that's how we thought that they'd</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4824" target="_blank">01:20:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">built this tunnel. And then these researchers went there and found out that actually they must have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4832" target="_blank">01:20:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to use other methods. And then in this paper, they describe these other methods. And of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4839" target="_blank">01:20:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">they can't know for sure, but they presented a bunch of plausible alternatives. The one that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4846" target="_blank">01:20:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for me is the most plausible is that what they probably must have done is to use something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4851" target="_blank">01:20:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">is similar to an iron sight on a rifle, the way you can line up your rifle with a target off in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4859" target="_blank">01:20:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the distance by having an iron sight. And they must have done something similar to that effectively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4869" target="_blank">01:21:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">with three sticks. And that way they were able to line up sticks along the side of the mountain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4877" target="_blank">01:21:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that were all on the same height. And so that then you could get to the other side,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4882" target="_blank">01:21:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you could draw that line. So this for me is the most plausible way that they might have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=4889" target="_blank">01:21:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">done that.

And probably one of, I mean, regardless of like, is of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6714" target="_blank">01:51:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">he won a Fields Medal, is a really smart and talented mathematician. It's also like a big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6724" target="_blank">01:52:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">inspiration for us, at least for some of the work that we do with Fermat's library. So Terence Tao</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6732" target="_blank">01:52:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is known for having a big blog and he's pretty open about like his research. And he also,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6738" target="_blank">01:52:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">he tries to make his work as public as possible through his blog posts. In fact, there's a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6747" target="_blank">01:52:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting problem that got solved a couple of years ago. So Tao was working on a problem,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6754" target="_blank">01:52:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">on an Erdos problem actually. So Paul Erdos was this mathematician from Hungary, and he was known</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6762" target="_blank">01:52:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for like the Erdos, for a lot of things, but one of the things that he was also known was for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6767" target="_blank">01:52:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Erdos problem. So he was always like creating these problems and usually associating prizes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6772" target="_blank">01:52:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">with those problems. And a lot of those problems are still open. And there will be, some of them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6778" target="_blank">01:52:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">will be open for like maybe a couple of hundred years. And I think that's actually an interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6782" target="_blank">01:53:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">hack for him to collaborate with future mathematicians.

But so Tao was working on one of these problems called the Erdos discrepancy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6795" target="_blank">01:53:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and he published a blog post about that problem and he reached like a dead end. And then all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6803" target="_blank">01:53:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a sudden there was this guy from Germany that wrote like a comment on his blog post saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6809" target="_blank">01:53:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">"Okay, so this problem is like a Sudoku like flavor and some of the machinery that we're using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6816" target="_blank">01:53:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to solve Sudoku could be used here." And that was actually the key to solve the Erdos discrepancy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6822" target="_blank">01:53:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">problem. So there was a comment on his blog. And I think that for me is an example of like how to do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6827" target="_blank">01:53:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">again, going back to collaborative science online and the power that it has. But Tao is also like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6835" target="_blank">01:53:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty public about like some of the struggles of being a mathematician. And even he wrote about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6844" target="_blank">01:54:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">some of the unintended consequences of having extraordinary ability in a field. And he used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6850" target="_blank">01:54:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">himself as an example. When he was growing up, he was extremely talented in mathematics from a young</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6856" target="_blank">01:54:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">age. Like Tao was a person, he won a medal in like one of the IMOs at the age I think was a gold</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6862" target="_blank">01:54:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">medal at the age of 10 or something like that. And so he mentioned that when he was growing up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6868" target="_blank">01:54:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">like, and especially in college, when he was in a class that he enjoyed, it just came very natural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6874" target="_blank">01:54:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">for him and he didn't have to work hard to just ace the class. And when he found that the class</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6880" target="_blank">01:54:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">was boring, like it didn't work and he barely passed.

And it talks about like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6922" target="_blank">01:55:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">having this conversation with his advisor and the advisor pointing out like, you're not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6927" target="_blank">01:55:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this is not working, you might have to get out of the program.

So I think Tao is also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6939" target="_blank">01:55:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">like this figure that apart from being just an exceptional mathematician, he's also pretty open</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6944" target="_blank">01:55:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">about what it takes to be a mathematician and some of the struggles of these type of careers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6950" target="_blank">01:55:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's super important. - In many ways, he's a contributor to open science and open</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=6955" target="_blank">01:55:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">humanity.

So I was able to, like based on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=8168" target="_blank">02:16:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">some images, like on previous episodes to figure out what was the size of the armies.

In our case, we're doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9057" target="_blank">02:30:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it for basketball. But what they're effectively trying to do was, have you ever watched Moneyball?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9065" target="_blank">02:31:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're trying to do something similar, right? Taking that, in this case, basketball,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9070" target="_blank">02:31:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">taking a statistical approach to basketball. The interesting thing there is that baseball is much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9077" target="_blank">02:31:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">more about having these discrete events that happen kind of in similar conditions. And so it's easier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9082" target="_blank">02:31:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to take a statistical approach to it. Whereas basketball, it's a much more dynamic game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9088" target="_blank">02:31:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It's harder to measure. It's hard to replicate these conditions. And so you have to think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9096" target="_blank">02:31:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it in a slightly different way. And so we were doing work on that and working like with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9101" target="_blank">02:31:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Celtics to analyze the data that they had. Like they had these cameras in the arena, they were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9106" target="_blank">02:31:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">tracking the players. And so they had a ton of data, but they didn't really know what to do with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9111" target="_blank">02:31:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it. And so we were doing work on that. And soccer is maybe even a step further. It's a game where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9118" target="_blank">02:31:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't have as many...

And so you can measure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9123" target="_blank">02:32:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">success. Soccer, it's more of a poisson process almost, where it's like you have a goal or two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9131" target="_blank">02:32:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">in a game. In terms of metrics, I wonder if there's a way... And I've actually have thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9135" target="_blank">02:32:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">about this in the past, never coming up with any good solution. If there's a way to definitively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9139" target="_blank">02:32:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">say whether it's messy or not, they're the greatest of all time. Honestly, measure,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9144" target="_blank">02:32:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">like convert the game of soccer into metrics, like you said, baseball. But those moments of genius,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9150" target="_blank">02:32:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">if it's just about goals or passes that led to goals, that feels like it doesn't capture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9158" target="_blank">02:32:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the genius of the play.

So whether like the fact that you just made a field goal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9828" target="_blank">02:43:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">if, you know, if on your next attempt, if you're more likely to make it or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9834" target="_blank">02:43:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was super interesting cause I mean, he pulled like, I think a hundred undergrads and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9841" target="_blank">02:44:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I think from Stanford and Cornell and asking people like, do you, do you think that's, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9846" target="_blank">02:44:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">do you have a higher likelihood of making your free throw if you just, just made one?

And then he looked at the data and this was back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9860" target="_blank">02:44:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in, as I said, like few decades ago. And so I think he had the data set of about, he looked at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9865" target="_blank">02:44:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it specifically for free throws and he had a data set of about 5,000 free throws. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9871" target="_blank">02:44:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and effectively what he found was that specifically in the case of free throws,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9877" target="_blank">02:44:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">he didn't, for the aggregate data, he didn't find that he couldn't really spot that correlation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9884" target="_blank">02:44:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that hot end correlation. So if you made the first one, you weren't more likely to, to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9890" target="_blank">02:44:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the second one. What he did find was that they were just better at the second one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9894" target="_blank">02:44:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">because you just got like maybe a tiny practice and you just attempted once and then, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9899" target="_blank">02:44:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to be better at the next one. And then I, I, then I went and there's a data set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9904" target="_blank">02:45:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">on Kaggle that has like 600,000 free throws. And I re-ran the, the same computations and,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9911" target="_blank">02:45:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and, and confirmed, like, you can see a very clear pattern that they're just better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9916" target="_blank">02:45:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">at their second free throw. - That's interesting.

Cause I think with tennis, they have like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9925" target="_blank">02:45:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">like a fault, like when you serve, they have analysis of like, are you most likely to miss</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9930" target="_blank">02:45:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the second serve if you missed the first, obviously.

So that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9935" target="_blank">02:45:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">integrates, that's so cool when psychology is converted into metrics in that way. And in sports,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9941" target="_blank">02:45:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it's especially cool because it's such a constrained system that you can really study</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=9946" target="_blank">02:45:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">human psychology because it's repeated, it's constrained.

I try to think that like, well, it depends on what your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=10219" target="_blank">02:50:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">path ends up being, but that it's not super important, right? Like exactly what you decide to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=10225" target="_blank">02:50:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">major on. I think Tim Urban, the blogger had a good visualization of this where it's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=10234" target="_blank">02:50:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">he has a picture where you have all sorts of paths that you could pursue in your life. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=10240" target="_blank">02:50:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe you're in the middle of it. And so there's maybe some paths that are not accessible to you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=10244" target="_blank">02:50:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">but like the tree that is still in front of you, it gives you a lot of optionality. And so-</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=10248" target="_blank">02:50:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">- There's two lessons to learn from that. Like we have a huge number of options now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=10253" target="_blank">02:50:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and probably you're just one to reflect, like to try to derive wisdom from the one little path</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=10262" target="_blank">02:51:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you've taken so far may be flawed because there's all these other paths you could have taken.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=10267" target="_blank">02:51:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like, so one, it's inspiring that you can take any path now. And two,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=10273" target="_blank">02:51:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like the path you've taken so far is just one of many possible ones. But it does seem that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=10278" target="_blank">02:51:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">physics and computer science both open a lot of doors and a lot of different doors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=10284" target="_blank">02:51:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">- True. - It's very interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMahzDCH1Y&t=10286" target="_blank">02:51:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">- It is.
