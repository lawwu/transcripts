It does though introduce a story I'm going to be talking about. So let me spend just a minute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4nShMpFBF4&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">on it. The essay came out around 36 hours ago and it basically describes the imminent arrival of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4nShMpFBF4&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">superintelligence.

Sam Altman did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4nShMpFBF4&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">though kind of give us a date for when he thinks superintelligence will come, or at least a range.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4nShMpFBF4&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">He said it's coming in a few thousand days. Now, it's probably not going to be terribly fruitful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4nShMpFBF4&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to analyze this prediction too closely, but if we define few as say between two and five, that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4nShMpFBF4&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">between 2030 and 2038. The story though of how we get there is, according to Sam Altman, quite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4nShMpFBF4&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">simple.

No, it's a remark he made further on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4nShMpFBF4&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">in the essay. You might think I'm going to focus on how he described AI systems that are so good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4nShMpFBF4&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that they can help us make the next generation of AI systems or how AI is going to help us fix the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4nShMpFBF4&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">climate, establish a space colony and help us discover all of physics.

It was reported just yesterday that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4nShMpFBF4&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">OpenAI thinks we're going to need more power than it was wildly speculated that even they were aiming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4nShMpFBF4&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">for just six months ago. The figures in this article are quite extraordinary and I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4nShMpFBF4&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to put it in context. But don't forget that framing from the essay we just saw. If someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4nShMpFBF4&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">were to genuinely believe and have evidence for the fact that superintelligence could arrive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4nShMpFBF4&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">within five to ten years then this would make some sense.
