things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">where I pull out three

about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">My wife and I together

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we think about crafting the deep life,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we think about the professional component of crafting a deep

target="_blank">00:03:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Classic time management.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If you do not have some sort of time management system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want to make sure that what I go for with my life, especially my career, keeps those various types of stresses within reasonable levels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this has a huge impact on the quality of your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Stresses past whatever your threshold is generates intense and immediate negative affects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we want to talk about just the subjective quality of your day to day life, staying within your stress thresholds is one of the most important things you can do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We often ignore this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We often focus on other goals, such as, you know, what you want your work to be, success, monetary goals, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes goals that aren't professional that still rise to stress levels, and that can wipe out any of the advantage you have from all the other engineering you're doing about your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want to talk about how you manage stress in this deep dive.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The outline of what I'm going to discuss.</span></div><div

professional stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Not all stress is

class="t">Two, I'm going to present the key question you should ask about the role of these types of stress in your life when you are doing lifestyle centric career planning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And three, I'm going to outline how to put those answers into action to actually change things or make decisions about your life going forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've got three parts to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Part one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">What are the main sources of stress, especially in the professional sphere?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.400</a></span> | <span

overload.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is stress caused by having lots of things that you need to do and barely enough time or perhaps not enough time to actually get it done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the classic stress of a college student who realizes the paper is due tomorrow, but they also have a midterm and their lab report also needs to get done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I have all these things have to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=378"

target="_blank">00:06:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So we see this common in the professional role.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I wrote down some examples here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So the classic business executive fighting fires, you know, you have six or seven different things going on and you're jumping back and forth on email, trying to try to take care of all these different types of issues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The freelancer that's navigating multiple client projects that are all supposed to be

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Overload the stress caused by having too much to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The second source of stress is expectations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is where you have very high expectations on something you need to deliver.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The issue is not having enough time to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The issue is meeting those expectations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.400</a></span> |

target="_blank">00:07:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">One classic example of this would be just looking to my own life, an author needing to deliver a good book manuscript.</span></div><div

of stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Third source, uncertainty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So facing the possibility of bad things happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think financial uncertainty is probably the most classic presentation of this source of stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So look, I went out on my own to try to make this thing work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

something could go wrong and that looming out there is a source of stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The final one I want to mention is conflict.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

physiological stress of back when he was a sort of liberal podcast radio personality and was like constantly on Twitter trying to do combat on behalf of his tribe.</span></div><div class="c"><span

I'm just kind of in the middle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, for example, I'm conservative with money in the sense that I'm pretty careful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Our family's pretty careful about let's keep our living expenses like always way below where they could be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But on the other hand, you know, I'm pretty clear eyed about risk and willing to invest in things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I remember, for example, investing in this office and building out a studio space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was before Jesse was here. I wasn't making enough money from the podcast to pay for this at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But I was like, you know, I bet they have a good shot of this happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I put aside, you know, put aside money for the lease payments for a year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If it doesn't work out, I could probably just, hey, was it would it be interesting for a year?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm OK with uncertainty. I'm not a wildly investing in things type of person, but it doesn't stress me out too much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of type A types are different. A lot of type A types I know are they love overload.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Like that's fine. They don't mind overload stress. In fact, they embrace that overload stress because it is something and this is common to type A type personalities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's something they know they can succeed in by just investing a lot of energy, by just grinding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, I take a lot on my plate and have to run around to put out these fires. If I just work long hours, I will get this done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like a source of, you know, feeling like accomplished, but they're sure they can do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas the same type A's often really dislike expectation stress because it's not something they can just for sure grind their way to a success.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I say, yeah, take on a bunch of stuff and stay up late and be on Zoom and email all the time, you're a type A type.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You can do that. You know, that'll work as long as I just keep working, stay up, it'll get done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Or if I say, write this book and it has to be successful. That's scary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you can't just I'll grind and then I'll be sure I have a book. It's it's more uncertain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So different people have different stress levels, different tolerances to these different stress types.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's put it that way. So this brings us to the third part of stress management, which is acting on your answer to those questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You should let your answers to those questions heavily influence your lifestyle centric career planning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We often do not use our self-assessments of stress tolerances when thinking about our vision of a life well live, our vision of the deep life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And this can get you into trouble. You can carefully construct a lot of aspects of your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you get there and end up in a situation where you're consistently jumping beyond your comfort threshold on some of these stress categories,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it's all basically moot because that will be such a negative source, such a negative subjective affect that all the other advantages you've just engineered are basically wasted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So you really have to keep your ideal stress levels in mind as a major factor in the vision you construct of the lifestyle that you're trying to pursue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, again, let me just use me as a quick example. I think about this heavily. I've thought about this heavily since I was a grad student, if not before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">My wife and I do a lot of planning of our vision for our family with stress management of these different types of stresses at the very top of how we think about things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is why, for example, it shouldn't be a surprise, given what I just told you about what I what stresses I mind, which ones I don't,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that I have two highly autonomous jobs that are huge on expectation stress, but make it possible for you to be very minimal on overload stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm a professor and I'm a writer. Both of those are jobs that have high expectation stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Think about professorship at a R1 institution like Georgetown. You have to publish papers and a lot of papers in top places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very competitive. Most papers get rejected, so they have to be great. If you don't do that, you get you lose your job. That's tenure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Think about writing. We're going to give you this money in advance. You better go sell copies of this book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you don't, we're going to stop giving you money for books in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Just go away for a year and come back with something that's worth this money that you can get hundreds of thousands of people to buy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=889" target="_blank">00:14:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">These are super high expectation type endeavors. Perfect for me. I'll get up for that every day of the week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">On the same time, because there's so much autonomy in those two jobs, if you're careful, and you know I'm very careful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm very careful with my time management. I'm very careful as I think about workload and my systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You can really reduce, if you're careful, overload stress in these positions. And I put a lot of work to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I only have very few periods in a typical year where I have an overload of things to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe if I'm doing book publicity, but that's only once every two or three years for just a month or so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then occasionally in academia, typically it has to do with a couple of service things will maybe fall together and there'll be a busy month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But otherwise, I have a lot of control if I'm careful. That is by design and it makes a huge difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If I did not care about my particular tolerances to particular stresses, it would be so easy for me to fall into a place where I have overload stress all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very easy as a professor, if you're not very careful about crafting your work and your obligation, your systems to fall into that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very easy as a writer to allow like what we're doing here to turn into a huge source of obligations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesse knows this. I keep our operations here in my media company really small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we do the podcast. That's basically it. We have this down to a science. It has a very constrained footprint.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We know the expectations. I resist like so many other people I know in similar situations in writing from building out a staff of 10 people and having to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That is a source of overload stress. I think for type A types, that's great because they're shifting some of their attention to overload stress away from the expectations of writing books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I would hate that. So all I'm trying to say here is different people react differently to these stress types.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Know how you react. Plan your life accordingly. There are few decisions you are going to make that will have more of an impact on just the daily experience, the positivity or negativity of your daily experience going forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So stress management, put that into your toolbox when you're thinking about crafting a deep lifestyle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't talk about it enough, but we should. It matters. Do you put any of that in your values plan?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a good question. We actually have a question later in the show where someone is asking me about how I structure my values plan and I have it with me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1036" target="_blank">00:17:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to load it up later in the show. We're going to I'm not going to read in detail. I'm going to go through exactly how I have it structured.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just looked at it in prep for the show. It's not in there where this is reflected in my core systems is actually in my strategic plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So quarterly plan or I call it strategic plan. The professional, my professional strategic plan has and maybe I should load this up. Let me grab my computer here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So for those who are listening, I'm grabbing I'm grabbing my computer because I want to see exactly how I have this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So Jesse is asking me and I think it's a good question. Where in my systems do I have any record of my ideal stress levels that I can use in planning?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going now I'm in my core directory here. I'm going to my quarterly or strategic plan for work. At the top of that, I have vision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have a section called vision. And it has one, two, three, four, five elements of my general vision for where I want my career to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is this is not a specific plan. It's kind of at the top of this planning document, but it's much more bigger picture than I'm working on this this quarter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, this is a quarterly plan. But I have this big picture vision at the top of this. I remember writing this about two years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">In this vision, I have notes that you could think of as stress management notes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1123" target="_blank">00:18:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So so in particular, I have a section in this vision labeled autonomy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I get pretty specific about like what I want my workload to be like, what I want things to be like in my academic job, teaching load and service where I talk about time affluence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually have time affluence highlighted in this. And I talk about my my deep to shallow ratio, working on really important things, remarkable settings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1149" target="_blank">00:19:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have a vision as part of this vision of my work. I have notes that captures what I want that work to be like from a stress aspect, like how much work I'm doing, when I'm doing that work, the rhythm of my work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1161" target="_blank">00:19:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's where I have this captured, not in my values plan, but actually in my strategic plan for my job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea is that I see this every time I update my strategic plan each semester. And so I keep this in mind as I'm moving forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So then say you have a week where your stress levels are high. How would you note that so that you could change behavior in the future?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1184" target="_blank">00:19:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I get real. I don't. It's really demonstrable. If I have a week, it's above my my my stress threshold. My wife notes it right away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I note it right away and I will almost always react by saying I need to yin yang balance this out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1201" target="_blank">00:20:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'll usually go forward like, OK, this is a really stressful period. I'll go to the next period that's still somewhat unscheduled.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll I'll usually go through and like aggressively claim and protect time. I'll say I'm going to balance this out with an unusually light period as soon as I can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll do this on multiple scales. So if I have a really busy day, maybe we have, you know, whatever I'm doing an event or we have a visitor on campus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1222" target="_blank">00:20:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll try to take a day later in the week and under schedule it. If I have a busy month, I'll try to make the next month a lot less full.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1230" target="_blank">00:20:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But I also do this at the seasonal level. You know, it was actually stress management that led me to stop taking summer salary from my grants for the summer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I really can take the summer essentially off from a lot of my Georgetown obligations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">In theory, Georgetown pays me 10 months a year in the summer. I'm on my own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1249" target="_blank">00:20:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a financial investment there because I have to pay my own salary those two months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1254" target="_blank">00:20:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But. When you care about stress management, it's like, oh, that's worth it if I can afford it, which I can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1260" target="_blank">00:21:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, that's that's a great investment, because those two months of having huge flexibility can really offset other more stressful parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's why I'm worried, for example, about this upcoming summer. I have a fellowship at Dartmouth where I'll be living up there with my family and teaching a course and doing a bunch of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's going to be really cool, but I usually completely take my summers off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1282" target="_blank">00:21:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's going to be interesting to see what is the impact of me to go from a normal semester at Georgetown to basically a summer semester back into a normal semester the next fall at Georgetown, followed by a semester with a book launch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1294" target="_blank">00:21:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll see. We'll see how that goes. So, yeah, I do try to balance out when I do a busy periods, overload periods, balance it out with periods of under scheduling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1304" target="_blank">00:21:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So really reducing that stress to minimal levels. All right, well, before we get into our questions, I want to talk about a new sponsor of this show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1317" target="_blank">00:21:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Did you hear that sound? That is the sound of a Shopify sale. And for so many online business entrepreneurs, that sound is music to their ears.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1332" target="_blank">00:22:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you haven't heard about Shopify, it's a service that makes it simple to sell to anyone from anywhere online, whether you're selling planners or let's say, what else would we potentially sell one day, Jesse?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1350" target="_blank">00:22:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Shirts that say, I don't know what slogan we would have on shirts. If we had merch, I don't know what our slogan, our slogan would be. Yeah. I'd rather be deep working. I'd rather be deep working than talking to you. That'd be a good shirt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1364" target="_blank">00:22:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you want to sell a, if we decide, you know, we're going to sell a, I'd rather be deep working than talking to you or a planner online, Shopify would be where we would do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1375" target="_blank">00:22:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Shopify is a platform that simplifies commerce for millions of businesses worldwide. They allow you to customize your online store to your brand, discover new customers and build relationships that will keep them coming back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1387" target="_blank">00:23:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">They cover all sales channels to successfully grow your business from in-person POS systems to an all-in-one e-commerce platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1395" target="_blank">00:23:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So we could sell our shirts in person with Shopify at the vegan soup restaurant downstairs. We'll see if they'll give us a kiosk down there. Even across social media platforms like TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if it would be ironic or like a great idea to sell. I'd rather be deep working shirts on TikTok. Right. Because like, it's the opposite of what that shirt is asking for, but that might actually, I think, be a great place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1419" target="_blank">00:23:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">A great place to sell it because exactly the people like, you know what, this is what I need. They also have 24/7 support and free on-demand business courses. It's here to help you succeed every step of the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1430" target="_blank">00:23:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's how every minute new sellers around the world make their first sale with Shopify. And you can too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1436" target="_blank">00:23:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You have probably shopped at a lot of Shopify stores and just don't realize it. Anytime you've shopped at a store that's not Amazon and you're like, this is great that it's an individual site, but the experience is super easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">They're probably using Shopify. So it allows all of the rest of us that aren't like a giant company to have really great e-commerce solutions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we sell our shirts, Shopify has got to be the way we are going to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1461" target="_blank">00:24:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you're ready to take your idea to the world, do it with Shopify, the commerce platform powering millions of businesses down the street and around the globe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1468" target="_blank">00:24:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Now it's your turn to try Shopify for free and start selling anywhere.

The things you've always wanted to do is closer than you think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1520" target="_blank">00:25:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm a longtime Masterclass subscriber. I went down a film and cinema rabbit hole with Masterclass. Longtime listeners know that's an interest of mine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1531" target="_blank">00:25:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I did Aaron Sorkin's Masterclass on screenwriting. I did Ron Howard's Masterclass on directing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1541" target="_blank">00:25:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, the Ron Howard Masterclass was beautiful. They built this giant, I'm talking 15 feet tall, 30 feet long, sort of curved giant screen that Ron was sitting in front of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1556" target="_blank">00:25:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he could play, freeze, play, freeze, play clips from his movies, which I think was really great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1562" target="_blank">00:26:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">What I particularly liked, though, was actually the Aaron Sorkin screenwriting Masterclass because they had as part of it footage of him sitting with students in a screenwriting course doing deconstructions of their actual scripts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So students would show a draft of their script and you would see Sorkin himself give feedback on it, which I thought was incredibly useful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1584" target="_blank">00:26:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not even a screenwriter. I was like, this is just fascinating to learn about how that world actually works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1590" target="_blank">00:26:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're a fan of this podcast, you're a fan of big thoughts, you're a fan of learning hard things, you're a fan of the intellectual life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1596" target="_blank">00:26:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So you really should be a Masterclass subscriber. So I highly recommend that you check it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1602" target="_blank">00:26:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This holiday, you can give the perfect gift of an annual Masterclass membership.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1608" target="_blank">00:26:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If you do that, you will get one free. So here's a chance for you to give the gift of knowledge and then in return, get a free membership as a reward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">To do so, go to Masterclass.com/deep today. That's Masterclass.com/deep. You need to slash deep to get that special offer.

I'm feeling coffeed up and ready to dispense some wisdom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1640" target="_blank">00:27:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Who do we have a first on our docket here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1643" target="_blank">00:27:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, here we go. We got Steve. So Steve says, as a freelance web developer, I'm constantly having things pushed onto my plate by clients on retainer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1652" target="_blank">00:27:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I would like to transition into a more project based workflow where I pull things when I'm ready, but I don't want to lose the financial security of my clients on retainer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1663" target="_blank">00:27:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, push pull. I love the distinction between push and pull. I actually wrote a whole section of my book on slow productivity I'm working on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1673" target="_blank">00:27:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a whole section on push versus pull. So this is somewhat on my mind as a quick reminder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1679" target="_blank">00:27:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can understand what Steve is asking about here. When it comes to task management and knowledge work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1687" target="_blank">00:28:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Most people implicitly rely on what I would call a push system. Anyone can push work onto your plate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1693" target="_blank">00:28:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you work at a big company, this might mean any of your colleagues or managers can just email you and like, hey, what about this? Can you do this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1701" target="_blank">00:28:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you join this? Can you help me with this? So anyone can push work on your plate. They don't know what your plate looks like or what you have on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1707" target="_blank">00:28:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no particular criteria for deciding, you know, can this person take anymore? Anyone can push to anyone at any time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1714" target="_blank">00:28:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This is also true in freelance client work. This is Steve's issue. He has these clients on retainer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1721" target="_blank">00:28:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're paying a monthly fee. He's in web development. So it's probably just to help them like update their websites or deal with issues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1728" target="_blank">00:28:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they can just push work on the Steve's plate whenever, hey, I have a problem with this. I want to add this feature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to change my site here. The contrast to push the alternative to push is pull based systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1741" target="_blank">00:29:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, other economic sectors do this really well. Knowledge work doesn't. In a pull based system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1748" target="_blank">00:29:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you work on a small number of things at a time. When you finish something, you then pull in something new to replace it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1755" target="_blank">00:29:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Pull based systems are a much better match for the way that the human mind operates than push based systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We are really wired to work on one thing at a time. Here's what I'm working on. Let me build an internal plan for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1769" target="_blank">00:29:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me execute that plan. Let me get the reward. How did this go? Let me integrate that into my memory of this work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1775" target="_blank">00:29:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, what's next? We are not wired to have seven or eight things going on at the same time that we keep jumping back and forth between.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1782" target="_blank">00:29:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Our mind can't maintain, for example, internal representations of plans for multiple concurrent projects that it can easily just shuffle in back and forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1789" target="_blank">00:29:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We do one thing at a time, shut that down, move on to the next.

Well, I want to float here the notion of simulating a pull system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1977" target="_blank">00:32:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I wrote a whole thing about this in my new book.

But I'm increasingly convinced that it's possible that someone that's in Steve's situation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1987" target="_blank">00:33:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or someone who works for a big company where their colleagues are not on board with switching to a whole new task management system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=1995" target="_blank">00:33:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">can still internally simulate a pull system, get most of the benefits of a pull system without anyone else having to know what they're doing or sign up for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2006" target="_blank">00:33:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So how does a simulated pull system work? Here's the key ideas. You implement what I call a holding tank.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2014" target="_blank">00:33:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This is separate from your list of the things you're actively working on right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2020" target="_blank">00:33:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The holding tank is where things you've committed to do build up. But in terms of what am I doing today?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2026" target="_blank">00:33:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You're only looking at that active list. And that has like one or two things on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2032" target="_blank">00:33:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">When you finish something on the active list, you then move something from the holding tank to the active list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2037" target="_blank">00:33:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's you make that decision right then. So most of your time, you're just executing a very small number of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2043" target="_blank">00:34:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You only pull something in new once you finish something. Okay, how do we now deal with the expectations of all the other people who are pushing these things onto your plate?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2054" target="_blank">00:34:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, this is where we get a little bit technical. But here's what I here's what I recommend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2058" target="_blank">00:34:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">When something comes onto your plate, so a client says, Hey, can you handle this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2062" target="_blank">00:34:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">What you want to do as you add that into the holding tank, I call this the holding take intake procedure,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2069" target="_blank">00:34:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is you want to put a time estimate on when you're going to get that done and label it with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2074" target="_blank">00:34:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">In order for this to be a reasonable time estimate, what you do is you look at all of the other time estimates of the things that have already been put into the holding tank, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2083" target="_blank">00:34:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a inductive or aggregate process. So if we assume that everything in your holding tank so far has a reasonable time estimate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2092" target="_blank">00:34:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and you label your new thing with a time estimate that respects this, so maybe you're looking at the five things and are like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2098" target="_blank">00:34:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">well, these will all be done by next week, then I can have this thing be labeled for the week after.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2106" target="_blank">00:35:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have to come up with a time estimate that makes sense, given all this work you see in your holding tank that it themselves all have time estimates on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2113" target="_blank">00:35:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Two, you communicate this expectation immediately to the person who gave you the work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2119" target="_blank">00:35:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And in doing so, you can even talk about the magnitude of your holding tank be precise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2125" target="_blank">00:35:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Be like, yep, I received this. Yeah, this makes sense. You want me to update the client page on your website? Great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2132" target="_blank">00:35:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Just so we're on the same page, I have eight other client updates queued ahead of you right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2139" target="_blank">00:35:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Looking at my estimates, I should be able to get to this by a week from Wednesday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2145" target="_blank">00:35:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If it looks like I'm not going to make that, I will give you plenty of advance notice if I have to shift that and we'll tell you the new deadline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2150" target="_blank">00:35:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you mark that you put it down. So when you when you put a time estimate on one of these new tasks going to your holding tank, you communicate the expectations with the person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2158" target="_blank">00:35:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">People are often worried about communicating this to clients or to other peers that they'll be they won't tolerate anything other than just get this done right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2166" target="_blank">00:36:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But the precision almost always destabilizes the immediate reactionary response, because really, what's my right response?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2174" target="_blank">00:36:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If I'm a client, you say I have eight things ahead of you. They each have a time estimate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2180" target="_blank">00:36:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the next free slot will have this get done by next Wednesday. All they can argue is either put me ahead of those other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2187" target="_blank">00:36:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But they have to argue, like, why am I better than this other these other clients or you're lying?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2193" target="_blank">00:36:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't have that many things or work overnight or whatever. Most people aren't going to make that argument.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2199" target="_blank">00:36:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Most people, we argue this all the time on the show. What really matters to them is not immediate action or responsiveness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2206" target="_blank">00:36:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's clarity. They just want to be able to get this off their plate and trust it's going to get done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2210" target="_blank">00:36:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This is why the system actually works. If you're haphazard, then I want you to do this right away, because otherwise I have to keep track of it and keep bothering you to see if you get it done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2219" target="_blank">00:36:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If you say I have seven things ahead of it and this will get done a week from Wednesday and you show me time and again that these time estimates are right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2226" target="_blank">00:37:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's just as good as you're doing it immediately in 99 percent of the cases, because both in both of those settings, I can say, great, I don't have to worry about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2233" target="_blank">00:37:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It'll get done. Right, so that's how this system works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2238" target="_blank">00:37:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The only subtlety here is if you have a really large thing in your holding tank.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2244" target="_blank">00:37:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, something's going to take weeks and weeks. You don't want to pull that into your active and just do one thing for weeks and weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2249" target="_blank">00:37:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So in that case, you have the big thing in your holding tank with all the details you need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2254" target="_blank">00:37:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I recommend using something like a digital task board to keep track of all this. You can attach files and notes to each of these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2259" target="_blank">00:37:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you identify the next step for that project. That's the thing you actually give the time estimate on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2264" target="_blank">00:37:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">When you pull the big project to your active list, you're only doing that next step.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2268" target="_blank">00:37:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you're done, you identify the next step, update the time estimate and put it back in your holding tank.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2273" target="_blank">00:37:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's just a little subtlety there. If you're talking about really big projects, you can do just one step of those big pull in one step of those big projects at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2282" target="_blank">00:38:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I was actually going to ask you about that, how the holding tank correlates with the task boards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2287" target="_blank">00:38:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so I would use a technology like a task board because you want to be able to have one place where all of the information relevant to each of these things is kept.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2295" target="_blank">00:38:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, like, let's say a client sends you a few more emails to update you on the website task they have for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2301" target="_blank">00:38:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You can just copy those and paste those right into the notes on the back of the task board task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2307" target="_blank">00:38:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what I use. And I think that's probably the right way to do it. So you can add files, you can attach files to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2312" target="_blank">00:38:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, here's the whatever, especially if it's a project with a lot of steps and it keeps going back and forth to your active.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2318" target="_blank">00:38:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You just have this big record of everything relevant to it. And so I would use a task board or you could use like shared documents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2325" target="_blank">00:38:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's fine. Like, you know, some people will just have a big document and just have bold headers for each thing and then just put as much text as they need underneath it as many notes as they need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2334" target="_blank">00:38:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's fine. If you're more tech savvy, you can use notion, you can use obsidian, you know, you can use one of these database based link based note taking systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2345" target="_blank">00:39:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So the holding tank is basically like the to do column on like a task board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2349" target="_blank">00:39:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah. So it's like the to you and you would probably still have most people who and this is the simulation of poll is new. So I can't talk about this with a lot of experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2359" target="_blank">00:39:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I would assume that most people are doing this are also going to have a standard task board set up because not all work is going to fall into this paradigm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2366" target="_blank">00:39:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You're still going to have like things to discuss at the next meeting with my boss column, there's still going to be like things to come in that don't fall into this like HR needs you to fill out a form or, you know, so there'll be things that happen or self initiated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2378" target="_blank">00:39:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can imagine these being like, yeah, columns on your task board, the holding tank and active from the holding tank, I would probably have a dedicated task board for simulated poll.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2390" target="_blank">00:39:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then another one for you know what's left for the different roles. But anyways, this is new, but I'm a big advocate of poll versus push.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2397" target="_blank">00:39:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I've mentioned this a few times in the New Yorker writing as well in the last couple of years. I'm really trying to seed this idea out here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2403" target="_blank">00:40:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That just because everyone in knowledge work, with the exception of I guess, computer programmers does push doesn't mean that that's the only way to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2411" target="_blank">00:40:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And I actually think it's a terrible way to work. One of the biggest mistakes we're making is push based task management.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2415" target="_blank">00:40:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like such a source of stress knowledge work right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2419" target="_blank">00:40:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, let's, let's go move on here. Maybe it looks like we have a little bit of a less technical question next. So let's let's move on with our next one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2427" target="_blank">00:40:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, sounds good. Question from Rosa. As a remote worker, how do I decide where to live?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2434" target="_blank">00:40:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">A good question, Rosa. This is more and more relevant. As more and more people get fully remote jobs, they get complete flexibility in where they live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2444" target="_blank">00:40:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a paradox of choice. Good news is you have complete flexibility. Bad news is you have complete flexibility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2450" target="_blank">00:40:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Now you have to make a choice. Everything's on the table. You worry about making a wrong choice. So you got the advantages of full flexibility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2458" target="_blank">00:40:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And you got the disadvantages. So Rosa, you're you're right to ask this question because it does matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2465" target="_blank">00:41:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Your location can play a big role in your efforts to cultivate a deep life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2473" target="_blank">00:41:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like one of the biggest factors. I mean, I think this and the specific work you do are two of the biggest factors, I think, in terms of having the most day to day impact on the your success in cultivating a deep life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2489" target="_blank">00:41:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I recommend is, as I usually say, go back to lifestyle centric career planning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2494" target="_blank">00:41:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Get this really cool, really clear lifestyle that you can, you know, see, touch and smell of what an ideal lifestyle would be for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2501" target="_blank">00:41:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This is not just job. It's all the elements of your life. And then when you're thinking about location of where you're going to live,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2508" target="_blank">00:41:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">what you're trying to do here is come up with a location that's going to give you the most net benefit on these various aspects of this vision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2517" target="_blank">00:41:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So let me let me be a little bit more concrete. That's a little bit vague.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2522" target="_blank">00:42:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me be a little bit more concrete. Here are five different what I have here, five different elements that might be a part of your your your vision of the deep life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2530" target="_blank">00:42:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Your ideal lifestyle. There's five different elements where your location will play a big role.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2536" target="_blank">00:42:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">One is in community and family. So the role of community and family. What's the community like where I live? How close am I to family?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2544" target="_blank">00:42:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Non-professional activity opportunities. Right. So, you know, if you're really big, I want to be in nature and outdoors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2552" target="_blank">00:42:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Living in Colorado is going to be have a very different effect on that aspect of your vision than, let's say, living in the mid-Atlantic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2559" target="_blank">00:42:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Work opportunities. So you have a vision of this type of work you want to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2563" target="_blank">00:42:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, if that vision, for example, is really fast moving, you know, high charge, you're you're in suits making making Masters of the Universe type plays like a city is going to really support that in a way that Boise would not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2579" target="_blank">00:42:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Vibe or attitude of where you live. Those of us who are in the Northeast sort of don't realize the degree to which there's a background current of stress and anxiety around here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2592" target="_blank">00:43:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you can just see it in the drivers. It's different in different places. It's different if you live in Vermont.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2599" target="_blank">00:43:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">People just aren't it's just not as stressful day to day as it is if you live in, you know, suburban D.C.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2605" target="_blank">00:43:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So like when if your vision really has a sense of are you like relaxed or is it not? I'm plugged in and doing lots of like however you answer that question, location is going to play a big role.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2615" target="_blank">00:43:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, that expense is the other one. If a place is cheaper, obviously, that gives you more flexibility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2620" target="_blank">00:43:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't have to earn as much money to have the same type of lifestyle. And so expense can play a big role.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2625" target="_blank">00:43:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically, what you have to do is, you know, you have these different attributes of your lifestyle that you're envisioning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2632" target="_blank">00:43:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">What you want those things to be like and you were evaluating different possible locations against those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2637" target="_blank">00:43:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the right way to do this and Rosa, you'll have to excuse me being overly nerdy and algorithmic here, but but I'm going to use a sort of quantitative framework here to capture something I think is a little bit actually more vague than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2648" target="_blank">00:44:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">What you want to avoid is allowing a clear positive on one of these aspects to paper over negative impacts on a lot of the other ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2660" target="_blank">00:44:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So you do not want to apply if we're going to be nerdy here, a max function to this evaluation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2667" target="_blank">00:44:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's let's let's think of this a little bit more quantitatively. Let's imagine you have these whatever these attributes are like in my case, I said community activity, work, vibe and expense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2677" target="_blank">00:44:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You have your list of things that are relevant in your deep life vision to your location. Imagine for each location, you're able to come up with a numerical score of that locations impact on that attribute of your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2691" target="_blank">00:44:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So the more positive the impact, the larger positive number you score it, the more negative the impact, the more negative number you score it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2700" target="_blank">00:45:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, if you really want to relax place, a relaxed lifestyle, but you're going to move to Manhattan, you would probably score that attribute with a big negative number.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2711" target="_blank">00:45:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The mistake a lot of people make is to look at all these different scores. We have a bunch of locations, so a bunch of different score sheets for each of these locations and to evaluate each on a max function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2723" target="_blank">00:45:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Which of these gives me the highest positive score? That's what a lot of people implicitly do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2729" target="_blank">00:45:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So like we're going to move to, you know, Idaho, because there's this one element of my life I really care about, it's, you know, activity opportunities or we're going to move to like San Diego because like surfing is really important to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2743" target="_blank">00:45:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And I get a big positive score for surfing. There's like a lot of surf breaks there. And and and it's and so that's what we're going to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2750" target="_blank">00:45:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I love the surf. Let's go to San Diego. If that same decision is giving you like little negative scores on everything else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2757" target="_blank">00:45:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That negative can all add up to swamp out the advantage you get from this one positive. So you can't just apply a max score, say, which location is going to give me the biggest boost on something in my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2767" target="_blank">00:46:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">What you want to do instead is do a summation of each of these scores, add up all the positive and negatives and see how it comes out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2773" target="_blank">00:46:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And what you're looking for is a place that ends up with the sum being as large as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2780" target="_blank">00:46:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, again, I'm being algorithmic here to try to emphasize a point that's actually way more fuzzy in practice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2787" target="_blank">00:46:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But to be concrete, let's give some concrete examples. If if going to San Diego gives me a high, like a score of 10 on this abstract scale, positive 10 for non work activity opportunities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2799" target="_blank">00:46:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But gives me a negative two on everything else. It's far from my family. It's the type of work I do is not available there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2806" target="_blank">00:46:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The San Diego attitude is like not at all what I'm looking for and it's expensive. Those negatives are going to add up to basically negate that positive score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2820" target="_blank">00:47:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, let's say you considered another location where maybe you're living in like New Hampshire. You have family near there. It's a small town with a sense of community.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2831" target="_blank">00:47:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's great for the type of work you want to do, because like, yeah, if you could just go in the Boston once a month, it's fine. It's cheaper. There's no property tax.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2839" target="_blank">00:47:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So all these are like these like reasonable positives when it comes to activities. Hey, you can still surf in New Hampshire.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2844" target="_blank">00:47:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You go to the you go to the coast, you wear a wetsuit. You know, my sister in law does it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2848" target="_blank">00:47:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe it's like a positive three instead of the positive 10 of San Diego. But you add up all these scores, you get a much bigger number. That's the right choice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2857" target="_blank">00:47:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm being needlessly technical to get to what I think is a much more fuzzy point, which is your goal in seeking a location is not to take one aspect of your life to choose one and say, how do I boost this as high as possible?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2870" target="_blank">00:47:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's instead to get the highest overall boosting on the things that matter. That's going to give you the largest day to day benefit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2876" target="_blank">00:47:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Rosa, that's the approach I would take. And then my final advice would be all of this is imprecise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2884" target="_blank">00:48:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So as long as you have a decision that by some reasonable scale, a scoring seems good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2890" target="_blank">00:48:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't second guess it because it's not a science, it's an art. But these are the big mistakes we want to just want to avoid the big mistake of taking one big swing in one aspect and making everything else not work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2901" target="_blank">00:48:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know. Is that the technical Jesse, what do you think of my now? It's an algorithm to technical. Yeah, I think it makes sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2908" target="_blank">00:48:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what I think about it. The the aggregate drag of lots of things that aren't quite right. Can really kill even like a really. I mean, this is this is this is known.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2918" target="_blank">00:48:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just being clear about something I think people know intuitively. It's a common thing. The most common place we see this is moving somewhere for the work opportunity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2926" target="_blank">00:48:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. We're like everything else kind of sucks. It's not like it's terrible, but you got a 45 minute commute and it's a little bit stressful in the schools, you know, and you don't really like the people like all that stuff just drags down the benefit you get of like, yeah, but I really wanted to work for, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2944" target="_blank">00:49:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, company X. So there's more systematic way of doing that. All right, what do we got next? All right, next question is from Rudy. Do you think rare and valuable skills from your book so good they can't ignore you are more or less the same thing as being impressive from your book High School Superstar?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2961" target="_blank">00:49:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's a good question. In the elaborate, elaborated version, this question, Rudy posits like, you know, he's an old an adult. Rudy posits like maybe these are the same things. They're not. But let me quickly review what they are. So High School Superstar is a book I wrote. The third book I wrote.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=2980" target="_blank">00:49:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This was, I think, 2009. Interesting book. It's what if Malcolm Gladwell wrote a college admissions guide? So it's kind of a quirky book, right? I deconstruct the psychology of impressiveness to understand this select group of people, students who get into really good colleges without they're not geniuses, but they're also not stressed out. They're not overscheduled. They're not burnt out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3004" target="_blank">00:50:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This was a huge issue at that time. That first decade of the 2000s, this was a huge issue, the stress of college admissions. And so I sort of wrote this contrarian book. And so I really deconstructed impressiveness and how a 16 year old or 17 year old can generate a high level of impressiveness that might help them get into a good school without having to be overworked or stressed out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3025" target="_blank">00:50:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so good they can't ignore you. By contrast, I talk about career capital. As you build rare and valuable skills, you acquire more of this metaphorical material or substance I call it career capital. That's what you invest to take control of your career and shift it towards things that resonate and away from things that don't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3042" target="_blank">00:50:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Rare and valuable skills are different than high school level impressiveness. And the real distinction here, and Rudy, this might be bad news for you, might not be what you want to hear. But the real distinction is that when you're talking about the impressiveness of a 16 year old on a college application, you're judging that 16 year old on their potential for accomplishments down the line later in life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3065" target="_blank">00:51:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this someone who has the potential when they're more trained up and older and have more opportunities and are ready to really go do things of obvious accomplishment in the world? So you're judging potential. When you're an adult, when you're in the world of work, you're not judged on your potential to go do good things. You're judged on the things you've done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3086" target="_blank">00:51:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, all right, Rudy, what are your accomplishments? Is this impressive or not? How hard was this? How much money this company make? How many people read that book? How many whatever? It's much more concrete. So you only have this little window where you'll be judged by your potential. Once you grow up, so to speak, you're judged on what you've actually done. And so there's really not the possibility of hacking goes away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3109" target="_blank">00:51:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So a high school superstar talks a lot about this impressiveness thing that we use to judge the potential of a six year old. It's really kind of fuzzy and you can hack it. This is how students become getting to good schools without being stressed out as you can kind of hack this psychology because we're just dealing with like, is this someone who's interesting to me?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3127" target="_blank">00:52:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of ways to hack that so that you don't have to try to whatever do 10 clubs. You can't hack actual accomplishment. You know, experts in your field knows did what you do is hard or not. Right. And so it's just much harder as an adult, that sense of, you know, I can finagle my way around. I'm just kind of an interesting guy and I'm doing these interesting things and people are just impressed by me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3148" target="_blank">00:52:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That kind of goes away as you get older. You actually have to do impressive things. And it's harder. So I don't know if that answers your question, Rudy, but I do think it's a good distinction to make is do not mix up what it means for a student to be impressive for what it means for, let's say, a 30 year old to be impressive. The three year old has a much harder job facing them. They're much harder task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3172" target="_blank">00:52:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I like that book, by the way, Jesse. It's one of my favorites. It's my least selling book because of the time it came out in a subject matter in the title. But it's a really cool book. Yeah. Yeah. It's wild. It's wild. I've talked about this on the show before. It's because I sold the book and then to imprint at Random House. Then right after I sold the book, Random House bought Penguin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3195" target="_blank">00:53:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And they just everything got reshuffled. Right. So they fired a lot of people that my imprint went away. And as I talked about, it got passed. I don't know the count. I think at least six editors at past weeks, everyone's getting fired and moved around. And by the time it finally landed. Right. And it landed eventually at like the dog walker of the assistant of my original. Right. Because it was just like I don't actually I don't know where it landed. It landed with a very good editor. But the point is, it landed with an editor who had no involvement in buying. I had no idea who I was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3221" target="_blank">00:53:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're like, it's chaos over here. The building's on fire. Half the people's got fired. Just like. Go write what you want to write. And I took advantage of that freedom to write a crazy book. It is an insane. I mean, it's an insane book. I'm talking about counter signaling theory from biology and how this like affects how admissions officers are thinking about whatever. I feature Ramit Sethi's younger brother. Oh, really? Manish is featured in that book. Yeah. Young Manish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3249" target="_blank">00:54:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">He wrote a book in high school which helped him get into Stanford. It's a really cool book. And it's my least read. So more people should read it. I think the title makes it too. It's just because the title is too narrow. It's like, oh, it's only for high school students. But it's really about the psychology of impressiveness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3265" target="_blank">00:54:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I like that book. I need to have more of my players read it. W players read it. The only person who's ever told me it's their favorite book of mine was Dan Pink. And I think that's only because when that came out, some of his kids were like just getting to high school age. It was like super relevant for it just hit them at the time where it was like super relevant. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, good to talk about that book. All right. Let's, uh, what have we got next? Let's do a call. Let's, let's hear a voice. Let's do a call here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3293" target="_blank">00:54:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Sounds good. Hi, Cal. My name is Jay and I'm a business systems analyst for a large corporate retailer. Well, I agree with everything you say about deep work and living the deep life. I can't seem to implement it consistently in my own life. I will have a few good days of time blocking and deep work sessions. But inevitably, I find myself back to mindlessly surfing the web and looking at my phone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3321" target="_blank">00:55:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This has been going on for the past year and I'm not really sure what to do next. Could you please give me some advice? Thanks and keep up the good work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3330" target="_blank">00:55:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Well, Jay, you're on the right track. You, you recognize the importance of cultivating a deep life in a world deluged by distraction, right? So you, you have the goal. You've recognized that deep work and your professional life is a piece of that. Building your professional life to degree possible around working on hard, valuable things and trying to avoid more of the shallow distraction. So you have a piece of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3356" target="_blank">00:55:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think what you need is to start filling in some of the other pieces of the deep life as well. This might not make sense when you first hear it, but it's absolutely true. Squaring away nonprofessional parts of your life, other parts of your life that have nothing to do with your phone or your computer actually makes it much easier to get those distractions under control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3376" target="_blank">00:56:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">When you start locking in community, constitution, contemplation, when you have a vision for your role in the lives of people around you, that you're sacrificing non-trivial time and attention on behalf to serve. When you're putting yourself into excellent shape and developing that, that identity of discipline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3397" target="_blank">00:56:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">When you are exposing yourself in a systematic fashion to big ideas, you're building a philosophical or theological base, your structure and discipline, all based on a foundation of intention aimed at the goal of having a deeper life. As all of these aspects of your life begin to tighten up, the appeal of let's see who's yelling at Elon Musk today diminishes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3422" target="_blank">00:57:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a holistic transition towards depth that helps you achieve that in all aspects of your life. And so it seems like all these different areas of your life are unconnected. What does your gym routine and the time you spend, you know, helping to organize the youth group at your church, what does that have to do with you checking email too much, looking at social media during work, but they are connected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3447" target="_blank">00:57:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The prioritization and pursuit of depth is an identity. It is an approach to life that once you are committed to, it will suffuse everything. And it will make, for example, idle phone checking feel off, feel like, you know, the athlete who's eating the Twinkie and is like, this isn't right. This is like out of step with everything else that feels important to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3474" target="_blank">00:57:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think that's what's going on, Jay, is you're on the right track, but don't just focus on the work. Am I doing enough deep work? Am I time blocking? Start working on the other aspects of your life to try to make those deep as everything comes together. They all begin to sing in harmony. And once they're singing in harmony, it's a song that you don't want to stop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3492" target="_blank">00:58:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, let's we got time for a couple more. What do we got next year?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3496" target="_blank">00:58:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Next question is from JT. How do I balance my lifestyle vision with my husband's vision? He has a high paying job and loves the city. I have a low paying job and want to live somewhere quiet and close to nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3510" target="_blank">00:58:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, JT, I'm thinking murder and get the life insurance money. I've been watching White Lotus, Jesse. That's what's going on here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3521" target="_blank">00:58:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I just finished it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3522" target="_blank">00:58:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. OK, so I won't spoil, but that's a White Lotus type. It's a White Lotus type answer. All right, JT, assuming you don't want to murder your husband and get the life insurance money. I will say a couple of things. One, at least this is my opinion on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3538" target="_blank">00:58:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it is very important for married couples to have shared visions of the life well lived. It is difficult, I think, to successfully navigate a life together when you have separate visions of the life well lived.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3555" target="_blank">00:59:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I see this a lot, especially in the sort of crowds you might run in in a sort of major coastal city where you have a lot of highly educated sort of aspirational type A type people. It's common to see a setup where both members of the relationship have their own unique visions and they see their vision as in competition with the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3577" target="_blank">00:59:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, this might just lead to a lot of resentment. Like, hmm, like, why do you get to do that? That doesn't serve my my vision. Or you see, this is kind of common is the sort of take turns model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3590" target="_blank">00:59:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Of like, well, look, you've been able to be pushing your vision stronger than mine for the last couple of years. Now it's my turn to push mine and you have to pull back. So it kind of ensures that at all points, there's someone who feels like they're being alienated from their vision of a life well lived.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3602" target="_blank">01:00:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not good either. This can create a lot of gender disparity issues. So if you have a husband and wife that have the that have similar visions, like you're both this comment around here, you're both lawyers and then you have kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3616" target="_blank">01:00:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And now the now the the wife is doing more of the work and has to have their vision. If they have a vision of being less like you both have a vision, let's go get after it. Law partners, theirs gets diluted and their husbands doesn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3629" target="_blank">01:00:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Huge resentment and tension, right? Because that's that's individual visions. You both everyone has their own vision of like whatever it is. And you're it's very hard to avoid tension.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3640" target="_blank">01:00:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think shared vision, if you're going to share a life with someone, the best strategies to come up one way or the other of a shared vision. Now, this takes work. So JT, the answer here is not to decide is your husband's vision or your vision, the right one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3654" target="_blank">01:00:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And you have the other person has to just follow the other person. The right vision here might be one that looks like neither of what you've come up with. It might require some creativity. You really have to step back and go through this exercise together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3664" target="_blank">01:01:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, what do we really care about? What are the things we really care about? Where's our common ground there? And you might come up with answers that surprise you. And it's not just we'll do my thing or we'll do your thing. It's like, oh, there's this whole other thing we could do. And this is quite different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3678" target="_blank">01:01:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I'm thinking, for example, of my aunt. Who was living in Manhattan, she moved to Manhattan to be a teacher at a prestigious school there somewhat later in life, like this was a somewhat like a midlife move, and she got remarried after she'd been living.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3696" target="_blank">01:01:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">She shifted to Manhattan and got remarried a little bit later in life. And but she was marrying someone who was not from who was from New England and was working also a teacher, but working in a boarding school that's more rural up there, but not the city like Manhattan is like a really specific thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3712" target="_blank">01:01:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is two different visions. He's he was very used to that lifestyle and she was really used to the city lifestyle. But they figured out a shared vision, which was like they teach and they live in Manhattan, but then they go to New Hampshire for the summers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3727" target="_blank">01:02:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And and there's other aspects of the vision, some details here, but it was a shared vision. Like, how do we have these different aspects all have all these different aspects live together?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3737" target="_blank">01:02:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that's what JT you need to do is you and your husband have to together start going through your vision of the life well live. And again, you might be surprised by what comes up as being important, and it might have very little to do about is it the country or the city that might be a red herring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3751" target="_blank">01:02:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Or maybe that's important, but there's other things you share that are really important. And you have this, you know, you construct this particular vision, or maybe what you end up with is you're in a city, but you're in a second city, not in DC, you know, not in New York, but it's a more tractable city, where you have a and it's less expensive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3769" target="_blank">01:02:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And you have a, you know, cabin, you know, whatever. I mean, I'm not gonna give you a plan. I'm just being influenced here by a something I just read from someone who they live in Las Vegas, but then have a cabin in the mountains, and they kind of go back and forth, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3785" target="_blank">01:03:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's like all these options out there. But you can't navigate them unless you sit down together and say, what do we really care about? Where do we agree on that? And, you know, I don't wanna give away too many of like how we actually answer this. But I will say from the very beginning, this is how my wife and I have always operated. It's all about five year visions for us and the whole family, me, her and the kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3805" target="_blank">01:03:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And this vision has shifted, you know, again and again, we've shifted this on these five year increments. But it was always something we figured out together, where we live, the work configurations, the school configurations, it's always this shared vision has been I think, that's been really successful. I think if we had gone into this with just like, hey, look, we're both Ivy League grads. And like, we're just going to each do our own thing and try to be as successful as possible. It would have been, you know, sparks on whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3830" target="_blank">01:03:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's many more options out there than you than you imagine. But you got to be clear about it. What do we care about? What do we want to do with our lives? And until you make those decisions, I get worried. A lot of rocky roads could otherwise be ahead. I always get nervous when I get marriage advice, Jesse. I don't think that's what people come here for. But, you know, I do my best. All right, let's do one more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3855" target="_blank">01:04:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Last question from Johannes. How do you structure your values document?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3861" target="_blank">01:04:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, good question. As I previewed earlier in the show, I brought up my computer. I'm just going to load it up and I'll tell you exactly how I have it structured. All right. So for those who are not watching at youtube.com/Cal Newport media, I am loading up my laptop. I can't tell you, Jesse, by the way, how many people now write me to despair or make fun of or marvel about my keys on my keypad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3886" target="_blank">01:04:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's pretty impressive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3887" target="_blank">01:04:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know. People are sending me like all sorts of options of like silicon covers and stuff like that. Let me tell you why it's a problem. My kids can't use my computer. So I was like one of my son, one of the writers stories I can use my professional writing software or whatever. They can't touch type. Right. So I have no I'm looking at my keyboard now. Here's the letters that are left on my keyboard. Q, Y, U, J, Z and X.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3913" target="_blank">01:05:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are the only letters still legible on my keyboard. So like they can't use it because they don't want the numbers. I just I don't look at my keyboard. Doesn't matter. I know where I just know I'm a touch typer just because I've typed my whole life. So my kids can't use my keyboard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3925" target="_blank">01:05:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Do they don't they teach touch typing in school with all the computers?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3929" target="_blank">01:05:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know. Not yet. I think they do eventually. But but not yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3935" target="_blank">01:05:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I had mine on a typewriter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3937" target="_blank">01:05:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We had apples. I think Mavis Beacon. You didn't have Mavis Beacon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3941" target="_blank">01:05:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We had some computers in the school for sure. But the typing course was on a typewriter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3946" target="_blank">01:05:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's interesting. You know, I was in a I guess this all makes sense given what I what I do now. But my school had this gifted and talented program for writing, essentially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3958" target="_blank">01:05:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in the third grade, I got pulled out into this. It was like six of us and all we did. So instead of having to read the normal books and do whatever we did, give us books to read.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3968" target="_blank">01:06:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But mainly we would just write like really long stories just again and again. We just wrote and wrote. We must have wrote hundreds of thousands of words in typical year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3976" target="_blank">01:06:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Wow. So as like a third grader and a fourth grader, we were just writing these, you know, is mainly fiction and some like nonfiction response. And we would read really hard books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3985" target="_blank">01:06:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, for some reason, I kind of had forgotten about that. And now I was bringing it up the other day. Like, oh, that probably explains a lot about me going into writing that like a very young age.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=3994" target="_blank">01:06:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I was pulled into a program where they're like, you just need to write all the time. You know, practice makes perfect, I suppose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4000" target="_blank">01:06:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think they do as much gifted and talented programs like that anymore, but it was good for me. So shout out to Mrs. Dudich, the GNT reading teacher.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4010" target="_blank">01:06:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Ironically, I was not pulled into gifted and talented math.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4013" target="_blank">01:06:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Really?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4014" target="_blank">01:06:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Even though I ended up going to MIT and becoming a math professor, basically. So, you know, I don't know what that tells you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4021" target="_blank">01:07:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess why I'm more known as a writer than a mathematician. All right. Anyways, who was this? Who asked this question?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4027" target="_blank">01:07:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Johannes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4028" target="_blank">01:07:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, how do I structure my values document? I have it loaded in front of me now. I structure it by role. So I have one, two, three, four, five roles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4040" target="_blank">01:07:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Father, man, professional, community member, spiritual. For each of those roles, I have a first person narrative of what, how I want to be or act in that role.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4060" target="_blank">01:07:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That narrative implicitly captures my values. Right. So I want to blah, blah, blah. The vision of manhood I strive for includes blah, blah, blah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4072" target="_blank">01:07:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I want in my career to blah, blah, blah. So it's narrative, first person narrative for each of these roles that captures my values.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4080" target="_blank">01:08:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So what do I want to be doing? How do I want to be showing up as a father? How do I want to be showing up as a man? How do I be showing up as my work as a community member in my spiritual life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4089" target="_blank">01:08:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So roles and somewhat narrative. That's different. I've had this structured different ways in the far past of my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4095" target="_blank">01:08:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think when I first created my first value document, I had just a list of values. Just bullet point, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4103" target="_blank">01:08:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then at some point I organized them into categories. This shift the roles I did at some point after I started having kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4110" target="_blank">01:08:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And I actually like this role based narrative capturing because you have like a narrative for each of these roles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4116" target="_blank">01:08:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like an image of like someone living the way you want to live. To me, that that's that was more tangible than just like an abstract list of value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4124" target="_blank">01:08:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Johannes, that's how I do it now. And for those who aren't familiar with the values document, the idea is you just review this on a regular basis to remind yourself of what really matters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4134" target="_blank">01:08:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">At the very least, review this once a quarter when you update your quarterly plans so that your long term planning remains aligned with what really matters to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4143" target="_blank">01:09:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I recommend looking at it each week, just at least glancing at it, like keep coming back to more than anything else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4148" target="_blank">01:09:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Living true to my values is what's going to matter through the good times and the bad times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4151" target="_blank">01:09:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I fall away from this. I'm very life becomes fragile. So you should have this document. You should review it commonly. That's how I do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4162" target="_blank">01:09:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Well, I got to tell you, Jesse, at least four or five times in this recording, I've looked at my watch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4169" target="_blank">01:09:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The very first time I looked at my watch, I correctly recognized that I forgot to wind it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4174" target="_blank">01:09:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's not it's a it's it's saying it's six o'clock, right? Like I need to wind it. So it doesn't have the time on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4180" target="_blank">01:09:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I've checked it four or five more times. I just keep looking at that every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4184" target="_blank">01:09:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, about every day. Yeah. It can maybe get two days. But yeah, yeah. It's all which I love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4190" target="_blank">01:09:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Analog, baby. All Springs. And I don't wear it every day. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4195" target="_blank">01:09:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's if you wear it, if you wear it every day, it's no problem. It's just like you do it when you when you first take it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4199" target="_blank">01:09:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The problem is I don't wear it every day. So then it dies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4204" target="_blank">01:10:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So there you go. So I see the real time on here. All right. Let me grab.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4209" target="_blank">01:10:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">What am I looking for here? We've got the questions I'm looking for is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4215" target="_blank">01:10:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The rest of my script. Here we go. All right. So we got coming up our final segment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4220" target="_blank">01:10:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Three interesting things where I go over three interesting things people have sent me relevant to striving to live a deep life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4226" target="_blank">01:10:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Before we get there, let me briefly mention another sponsor that makes this show possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4230" target="_blank">01:10:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That is our friends at Rhone R H O N E.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4236" target="_blank">01:10:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesse and I are both fans of Rhone's new product, which is their commuter shirt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4242" target="_blank">01:10:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I love their T-shirts.

Here's the first interesting thing of our segment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4476" target="_blank">01:14:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It is an article from The New York Times, a column by our good friend Ezra Klein.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4484" target="_blank">01:14:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been on his show multiple times, so if you haven't heard that, you should go listen to those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4489" target="_blank">01:14:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This column he wrote on December 11th, and I should say if you're watching the show at youtube.com/calnewportmedia, you'll actually see the article.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4497" target="_blank">01:14:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're listening, I'll explain to you what's on the screen right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4501" target="_blank">01:15:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So the topic of this article, the title of this article is The Great Delusion Behind Twitter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4507" target="_blank">01:15:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So you already know I'm on board. Here's the key point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4512" target="_blank">01:15:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I should say what's the first of two key points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4514" target="_blank">01:15:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first key point here is Ezra says it feels like for ages we've been told that Twitter is or needs to be the world's town square, but that this metaphor is wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4525" target="_blank">01:15:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. This should be a familiar point. I'm glad to see Ezra make it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4528" target="_blank">01:15:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I've made this point many times, including my last article on Twitter that I wrote for The New Yorker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4534" target="_blank">01:15:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I argued exactly this point, that the issue with Twitter is not the details of how it's run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4539" target="_blank">01:15:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the fact that we keep trying to tell ourselves that it's vital and it's not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4543" target="_blank">01:15:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It feels that way to reporters, but to the rest of the population, it's not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4547" target="_blank">01:15:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't need to obsess over exactly how Twitter is run. We need to stop obsessing over Twitter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4553" target="_blank">01:15:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So Ezra gives three reasons why the metaphor of the town square is wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4557" target="_blank">01:15:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So these are interesting, a little bit different than my arguments. Let's briefly summarize them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4561" target="_blank">01:16:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Number one, there isn't, can't be and shouldn't be a global town square. It's a good point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4569" target="_blank">01:16:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Why do we need a single location where all people for all issues can gather to talk?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4576" target="_blank">01:16:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This doesn't work. Right. And we've seen that with Twitter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4580" target="_blank">01:16:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Having a single place with a uniform interface where everyone looks exactly the same, all tweets look exactly the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4586" target="_blank">01:16:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no distributed curation. There's no social capital. There's no hierarchy of ideas built through reputation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4591" target="_blank">01:16:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just anyone can show up and say, you know, do better Nazi.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4596" target="_blank">01:16:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And it looks the same as anyone else. Of course, that's going to fail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4600" target="_blank">01:16:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I mean, imagine if we had a literal global town square, like people from all countries can all come gather in this place to argue about things with no holds barred.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4609" target="_blank">01:16:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Everyone wearing the it's just not going to work. All right. Number two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4613" target="_blank">01:16:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Town squares are public spaces governed in some way by the public. All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4617" target="_blank">01:16:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Another good point from Ezra is like where you do see town squares, they're not at the global scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4620" target="_blank">01:17:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">They're at the scale of a town or a city. The public owns them and has a say in how they operate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4628" target="_blank">01:17:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This is not the case for a service like Twitter. It's a private company that's trying to make money by monetizing people's eyeballs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4634" target="_blank">01:17:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not a public square. That's a movie theater. That's a coliseum. It's an entertainment venue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4640" target="_blank">01:17:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Ezra's third point. What matters for a polity isn't the mere existence of a town square, but the condition the townspeople are in when they arrive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4649" target="_blank">01:17:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So if you let's say you have a town square, you're going to stretch this metaphor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4655" target="_blank">01:17:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You have a small town, you have a town square where people are can gather and the public decide, like, OK, this is where we're going to gather to discuss things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4662" target="_blank">01:17:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But if the way it works is that on the way to the town square, you know, everyone is given a six pack and some meth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4669" target="_blank">01:17:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then as they get closer, they're put on, like, scary purge style mask and given weapons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4676" target="_blank">01:17:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the town square itself has like strobe lights going and Trent Reznor sort of unsettling discordant sounds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4683" target="_blank">01:18:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not going to be a situation in which you're going to have some good discussion going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4688" target="_blank">01:18:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And essentially, this is led Twitter's the digital equivalent of this. It's just the dynamics of Twitter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4693" target="_blank">01:18:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Plus, just a cultural reputation is built up is when you get onto your Twitter account today, you're there to you're there to swing a bat at somebody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4701" target="_blank">01:18:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So the conditions aren't right. So those are good points from Israel. This is not some global town square that serves the goods.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4707" target="_blank">01:18:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We should stop calling it that. OK.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4711" target="_blank">01:18:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we got a little summary here. Billions of people use these services. Their scale is truly civilizational.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4718" target="_blank">01:18:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And what have they wrought is the world more democratic is GDP growth higher is innovation faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4724" target="_blank">01:18:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Do we seem wiser? Do we seem kinder? Do we seem happier? These are the core questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4728" target="_blank">01:18:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And like finally, like what is you're saying is like the final way you'd want to evaluate the necessity of a given metaphorical town square is like, is it doing the things you'd want a town square to do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4737" target="_blank">01:18:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And Twitter is doing none of those. It is not making the world more democratic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4742" target="_blank">01:19:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a period in 2009 where we thought it was going to spread democracy throughout the Arab world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4748" target="_blank">01:19:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There's the Arab Spring moment. And then beyond that, like, no, it doesn't work. It does not happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4753" target="_blank">01:19:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not helping the economy. It's not causing more innovation. It's not making people smarter, kinder, happier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4757" target="_blank">01:19:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's achieving none of the things we would want. Yet we're still obsessed about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4762" target="_blank">01:19:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is vital and it has to be protected and we have to care about it. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4767" target="_blank">01:19:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">What's really going on here again? It's it's it's the I believe a lot of this like obsession over Twitter and lionization of it as this like critical thing to the civic life is far from a universally held belief.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4780" target="_blank">01:19:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It is a belief that is held incredibly strongly by an incredibly small group of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4784" target="_blank">01:19:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Elite journalists, it's at the core of their life, their self-definition, their professional success, and a lot of how they feel good about themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4791" target="_blank">01:19:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the voices we hear talking about Twitter are the voices that are obsessed with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4797" target="_blank">01:19:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we get this portrayal. We're forced to read about this on the front page of our newspapers and magazines of the news programs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4802" target="_blank">01:20:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't care about Twitter. We, as the regular polity, as Ezra Klein would say, shouldn't have to suffer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4810" target="_blank">01:20:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">From, you know, a Fox News or CNN reporters, Twitter obsession. This is like a playground for you guys.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4817" target="_blank">01:20:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not a town square and it's just making it worse for the rest of us. So that's my theory on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4824" target="_blank">01:20:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The second point from this article that I thought was relevant, and I'll just briefly mention it, just I think there's there's something really deep here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4831" target="_blank">01:20:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't have time to really unpack it. Ezra talks about a paper by Benjamin Farr, F.A.R.E.R. political scientist from Knox College.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4841" target="_blank">01:20:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Who argues that we have mistaken the key resource upon which democracy depends.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4848" target="_blank">01:20:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That resource, the actual key resource is attention. Not your attention or my attention, our attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4854" target="_blank">01:20:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Attention in this sense is a collective resource. It is the depth of thought and consideration of society can bring to bear on its most pressing problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4861" target="_blank">01:21:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so with so many collective resources from fresh air to clean water, it can be polluted or exhausted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4865" target="_blank">01:21:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll leave you on that thought from this article that not only is Twitter not a global public square that's critical to the functioning of the world and improvement, it actually is making the world less democratic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4877" target="_blank">01:21:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">When you exhaust the collective attention of a population, they do not have that resource left to invest in the things that really matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4884" target="_blank">01:21:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's actually robbing from us. It's not just failing to match what we want it to do. It's actually making everything else worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4891" target="_blank">01:21:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want to talk about this article. I try not to talk too much about Twitter these days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4896" target="_blank">01:21:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There's only so much social media talk I want to do. But look, if you're going to live a deep life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4901" target="_blank">01:21:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The role of these attention assassins matter. And it's why I keep coming back to things like Twitter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4907" target="_blank">01:21:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're obsessed with it, if you're on it all the time, if you think it's the key to civilization, you're sweating all day about exactly who what the rules are, how it operates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4915" target="_blank">01:21:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You're making it very difficult for you to cultivate a deep life. I always talk about the deep life as being something that is in opposition to distraction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4923" target="_blank">01:22:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This is one of the more purified forms of distraction that we've yet had to face as people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4928" target="_blank">01:22:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Twitter lecture over. Let's go to the second item.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4933" target="_blank">01:22:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a lot less controversial. Here is a study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4938" target="_blank">01:22:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This appeared in the Journal of Experimental Psychology. It's not a new study. What is this from?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4943" target="_blank">01:22:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">2014. Several people sent this to me, though, recently. So someone must have mentioned this probably somewhere in the last couple of weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4951" target="_blank">01:22:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. It's a study that's titled Give Your Idea Some Legs. The Positive Effects of Walking on Creative Thinking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4958" target="_blank">01:22:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's by Marley Oppozo and Daniel Schwartz from Stanford.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4963" target="_blank">01:22:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the study finds what the title implies. I'll just give you the abstract here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4968" target="_blank">01:22:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Four experiments demonstrates that walking boosts creative ideation in real time and shortly after.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4975" target="_blank">01:22:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So here we have an experiment, an experiment validating a key toll in the cultivation of the deep life that we talk about often get moving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4984" target="_blank">01:23:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I do a lot of my work on structuring articles and book chapters, as well as a lot of my work on the mathematical proofs I do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4990" target="_blank">01:23:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The key insights almost always come from walking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4995" target="_blank">01:23:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I spend a lot of time on foot. That is my engine for making breakthroughs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=4998" target="_blank">01:23:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not the mode in which you follow through on the breakthroughs. It's not the mode in which I write the articles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=5004" target="_blank">01:23:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The mode in which I figure out the structure of the article. It's not the mode where I get every math detail right on my proof.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=5009" target="_blank">01:23:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the structure where I get it's the mode where I get the insight that makes the whole proof possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=5013" target="_blank">01:23:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So walking is an insight generation machine. If you want to live a life that's deeper, less affected by distraction,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=5020" target="_blank">01:23:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">walking should be a big part of your professional routine, not some exercise you do when you have time, when work is not in the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=5027" target="_blank">01:23:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">A core element of how you actually get your work done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=5031" target="_blank">01:23:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. The third thing I want to talk about here is a profile from The Guardian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=5039" target="_blank">01:23:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's of a Scottish mystery, I think, detective writer, Ian Rankin.

It's a case study, a deep life case study. I love these deep life case studies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=5058" target="_blank">01:24:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There's just a couple aspects of this writer, Ian Rankin's life that I just wanted to mention here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndyMjzDGKMA&t=5064" target="_blank">01:24:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Just let's just be aspirational for 30 seconds.
