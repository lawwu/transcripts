Patrick, thank you for being here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Happy to be here and speak with you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I just spent some time talking about some of the aspects of how people and their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">families can start to protect themselves, their documents, and I didn't spend as much time on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the legal side of things. So I think most people have heard of the term will and I've written about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it a bit and we've mentioned it in the past. Maybe we could just start at the basics about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">what kind of is a will and who needs one? Yeah, that's a great question. So a will is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">fundamental estate planning document. And once you have all of your decisions made and your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">intentions and your preferences, it's these legal documents are the ones that actually make them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">legally binding, enforceable, and valid. So that's the difference between I have a desire</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and now I actually have an enforceable legal decision. That's the estate planning documents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And the will is the cornerstone, fundamental estate planning document. It's incredibly old.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's been around the concept of a will since ancient Greece, but the will as we know it today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">even that the origins kind of trace back to the 16th century. Henry VIII was the king when they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">passed the Statute of Wills Act that set a lot of the requirements that we're still working with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">today. So that's how long a will has been part of estate planning in modern society, if you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">really call the 16th century modern society. We're still using the same rules. So I guess I got to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">give them a little bit of credit. Wow. I didn't know the history. Are there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a handful of things if you went through a list of like what are the main components of it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the decisions that you want to think about before creating one?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, absolutely. So a will, because it is a very fundamental document, it handles fundamental</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">needs. And there's three primary needs that every will will handle. And the first is it will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">dispose of your assets. It will say where your things go, who gets what after your death. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a will only applies at death, but that's what it does is it transfers your assets after death.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The second thing after disposing of your assets is it will choose who will care for your children.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Now your children are not assets.

And the last thing that a will does is allows you to specify your own final arrangements,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">your burial preferences.

And the question is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is that legally valid and enforceable?

And in many times, unfortunately, the answer is no. And so when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">have that result, you may think you have a plan, but the law disregards your plan and you wind up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">dying with no estate plan at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so let's take an example. Somebody has $50,000, one child, and a strong desire to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">cremated, but no will, no email sent to anyone.

And that simply means that you have no will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">at death. And every state has a set of laws that will apply that says, if there is no will,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">here are the default laws.

So it's an attempt to fill in those gaps,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's not a perfect solution by any stretch.

So $25,000 to each of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's just that default law. Now, that spouse might be the person who has the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">presumed authority to make decisions who could say, "Hey, I happen to know that this person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">wanted to be cremated. So we're going to choose cremation." But if they don't know that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">or if they disagree with that, if you've never expressed that preference at all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that spouse may have the legal right to act, but they don't have the knowledge of what your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">preferences are. So you have to have both sides. You have to have clear intentions and you have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">have legal authority.

And if you didn't have a spouse, what happens to children or assets? Or if you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">have children, what happens to assets? Yeah. So if you don't have a spouse,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't have children. Most of these state laws, what they have is a set of, essentially,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">an if-then statement. So if you have a spouse, everything goes to your spouse. And if you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a spouse and one child, it's divided equally. If you have a spouse and two children,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it's just kind of corresponding, cascading set of decisions. But if you really boil it down,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">all of these laws basically say assets pass to your closest living relatives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you have a spouse, maybe your spouse or your kids, and if you don't have one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it might be your parents or your siblings.

So if you're really isolated and don't have close family,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it might still pass to your cousins. The problem is getting that process completed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">getting to that finish line could be a difficult step. And it's just sometimes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">by the time the assets get to that cousin, the assets might even be depleted by fees and expenses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you're really starting to eat into the beneficiary's actual receipt of funds from your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">estate. And I assume if you had neighbors who were kind of unofficial godparents to your children,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and your desire was, "I wish they could take our kids," and you didn't have a will to state that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I imagine that would probably be a difficult thing because neighbors and friends probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">aren't in the kind of statutes of if-then statements. Right, absolutely. And so if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">have assets you want to leave to your neighbors or your close friends, the law just doesn't look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">at that at all. It's either a family member or you're not. So if you have something like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you really critically need an estate plan in place. But with children, it's even trickier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">because ultimately the court is compelled to do what is best for the child. So even if as a parent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I say, "I want my neighbor to care for my child," and the court will look at that and it's very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">unlikely. But if the court says, "Hey, this is a really bad decision for some unknown scenario,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe the neighbors have developed a drug habit or something like that that is unknown to me,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the court can actually step in and say, "We're going to overrule this decision and we're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to pass the children to someone else." And it kind of leaves the court with almost too many options.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Should we give it to a family member?

And what's already, if you think about a tragic time, the loss of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">a parent, it's a lot for a child to be expected to bear.

The other type is something like maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">your credit card bills. And that's just as a personal promise to repay that debt. The benefit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of that second type, your credit cards, any sort of normal outstanding loans, they don't evaporate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that death.

And then a state plan can contain a variety of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">documents depending on your particular situation. Most typically, an estate plan will have at least</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a will and a set of healthcare documents, maybe a power of attorney or a living will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">or advanced healthcare directive, something like that. So that set is really the fundamental</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">building block of an estate plan. You can also add additional documents. So a trust,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a living trust, for example, is a very common additional document to be included in an estate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=810" target="_blank">00:13:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">plan. And if you start getting in more complex situations, you might have other types of trust,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe your asset protection trusts or really charitable giving trust, anything like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that are really specific tools for specific use cases. Not everyone's going to have those as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">part of their estate plan. But if you have that need, it is a great fit for your situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But that core set, will and healthcare documents. So fortunately, we're going to have Monte from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Valor on the show in a little bit.

I know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">even I originally got confused when I was like, "Okay, so there's a will and then there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">living will.

So for anyone listening, and you're kind of thinking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">"What kind of decisions would I want to make?"

What kinds of... The options are often like, "Go at all expense to try and prolong my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">life."

So those are the kinds of decisions that you might have a different opinion on than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">whoever's in charge.

No one else can make the same choice that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you would in that circumstance. They're also very difficult decisions. And so it's unfortunate for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">anyone to be asked to make a decision with no guidance.

A will goes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">through probate after death and it becomes essentially a public document. And a trust</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=1315" target="_blank">00:21:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">stays private.

And that's something that a will, by nature of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=1332" target="_blank">00:22:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">will, it goes through probate and a trust just simply bypasses the probate process entirely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=1337" target="_blank">00:22:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">That can be a massive savings of not just time and effort, but money for a whole lot of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=1343" target="_blank">00:22:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have a couple questions there.

In California, a two-year probate is close to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=1381" target="_blank">00:23:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the norm these days. So the fees involved with probate, they vary by state, but then they also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=1390" target="_blank">00:23:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">vary by the facts of your particular estate. In California, the threshold was recently raised,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's now 184,000 of whether or not you can have some sort of short-form probate or if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=1402" target="_blank">00:23:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">have to have a full probate. Once you reach that threshold, the amount that you're actually going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to pay in terms of fees and expenses, it's basically a percentage of the overall value</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of your assets. But as a quick example, if you have a million dollars of assets in California,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=1417" target="_blank">00:23:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you might look to pay maybe $50,000 of fees all out the door to get through the probate process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And just to clarify, that million dollars is the gross value of your assets.

So you have less upfront liquidity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=3745" target="_blank">01:02:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is one of the key trade-offs you're making, is you get less upfront liquidity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=3750" target="_blank">01:02:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in exchange for your assets being able to stay in a tax-free environment and continuing to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=3757" target="_blank">01:02:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">compound and grow on a pre-tax basis. So it's a little bit of the, "Do you need the money now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=3763" target="_blank">01:02:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">or are you trying to create more long-term wealth?"

And it's not all or nothing. So if in a given year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=3772" target="_blank">01:02:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you were to make $2 million, you don't have to put all $2 million in any of these vehicles.

Exactly. So for instance, we have some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=3783" target="_blank">01:03:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">customers who are tech employees.

And they ended up putting 50% into a shareholder remainder trust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=3795" target="_blank">01:03:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they sold the other 50% in their own name to buy a home. So it depends. It's not all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=3800" target="_blank">01:03:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">or nothing. And there's also one of the big benefits of these shareholder remainder trusts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=3804" target="_blank">01:03:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is you don't have to put in all the assets up front.

Now, this is an irrevocable trust,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=3821" target="_blank">01:03:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">which is part of why you get these tax benefits. So once you do put assets in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=3826" target="_blank">01:03:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you can't decide to change your mind after the fact.

And then when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=5067" target="_blank">01:24:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it appreciates in the future, it's already in the ownership of a trust or your kids.

There's kind of a famous example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=5130" target="_blank">01:25:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">where Phil Knight, the founder of Nike, took Nike shares, put it in an LLC, and then he gifted parts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=5139" target="_blank">01:25:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of it over time to his son.

So it's the most complex, insane example that...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=5220" target="_blank">01:27:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">By the way, if you have $45 or $50 million, you're probably working with someone to do stuff like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=5224" target="_blank">01:27:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this. But at the end of the day, it says, "Your net estate post-tax with this example was $500</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=5230" target="_blank">01:27:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">million versus the $198 million that you would have paid in the previous example, netting you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x24OSKgBcvQ&t=5237" target="_blank">01:27:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">an extra $300 million."
