So if that's the case, happy Thanksgiving evening to you. I hope your day was full of great fellowship and good food. Now we can push through the tryptophan haze together and we can do it while talking about the solid meat of sound doctrine.</p><p>It's a question that comes to us from Derek. Hello, Pastor John, thank you for the podcast and for answering very hard Bible questions throughout the years. Here's mine. Is there an ideal mark of doctrinal maturity to reach in the Christian life that once a person has gotten settled on the basics of Christ's life and work, his death and resurrection and the future of his return, then moves on from these foundational doctrines, leaving them behind, so to speak, and not returning to them and rethinking them over and over throughout the years?</p><p>In other words, how do you, Pastor John, interpret Hebrews chapter 6, verses 1 to 3? Well, it is certainly right that we not be constantly going back to the basics of our faith as if to dig up the roots to see if they're still alive. That's a good way to kill a plant.</p><p>And you don't constantly disassemble the foundation of your house to see if it's firm. That's a good way to bring the whole house down on your head. So that's the first thing to say. The second thing to say is, no, there is no ideal mark of doctrinal maturity in the Christian life.</p><p>The Bible does not speak in terms of an ideal level of doctrinal or moral or spiritual maturity having been reached. It speaks of minimal standards needing to be attained, and then a lifelong constant pursuit of growth. So Ephesians 4 describes a kind of minimum knowledge and maturity growing up so that the saints aren't blown around like leaves or like children being knocked off balance by every wind of doctrine that comes along.</p><p>And then 2 Peter 3:18 says, "Grow, grow in the knowledge and the grace of the Lord Jesus." So the Bible doesn't talk in terms of an ideal level to be attained. It constantly presses us onward and upward into more and more discoveries of God's unsearchable riches. But I want to suggest to Derek maybe a significantly different way of understanding Hebrews 6:1-3 than I sense he has.</p><p>He's assuming that what the author tells us to leave behind is gospel basics. I don't think that's what the writer is referring to in verse 2. Let me read it and try to show Derek and everybody else what I mean.
