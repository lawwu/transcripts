I'm so excited to be here talking about like figuring out like how do we like AI and human like work in the world of whiteboarding and I built Excalibur and if you don't know about it like you'll see like many things about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the expectations you probably have about a speaker at the AI engineer conference is that I talk about AI on every single sentence for the entire talk. So I'm just going to give you a warning. I'm only going to do it for the second half of the talk. But the first half is going to be a good setup and you should like pay attention because it's going to be really interesting content. So let's get started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So we are five years ago. I'm working at Facebook January 1st and as you if you've been at any like big company there's like the performance review process. And so we are you have to give feedback around like all the people you've been working with like how good or bad you've been doing and same for your manager.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And one thing that's like I'm probably not unique in this room but there's this little devil in me that is like nope you're not going to do it until the very very last minute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is called procrastination and I'm really bad at this and I've tried like many techniques over the years and the one at that time that I worked on is what I call active procrastination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So I know I'm not going to be able to write the performance reviews until like the last minute so may as well do something actually useful in the meantime otherwise I would be like doom scrolling on my phone and not be productive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what I ended up doing is I wanted to write a blog post for a long time and so I was like okay I'm going to write a blog post.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I used a tool called Zwibbler in order to draw like this kind of like hand written like illustrations and unfortunately at the time the website Zwibbler was done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like no come on I've wanted to not procrastinate and everything and then it's still done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what did I do I'm like okay we're going to go like one level deeper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">What would it take to actually re-implement Zwibbler?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">How hard would it be?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I opened the code sandbox and I like drew like wrote some code to use rough.js and now hey I got a demo and the thing I didn't expect is I posted about it on Twitter and like it exploded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Like 200 likes on this first tweet and like so many people like replied and commented and were excited about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like oh this is so cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this was the beginning of Excalibur.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Now one of the thing is if I were to do this again in the future like right now I would not like start writing code myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I would probably do use any of the coding agents that we've seen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And the good thing is I'm not the only one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at two weeks ago during the Anthropic keynote when they wanted to demo Claude's AI agent they actually used Excalibur for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And they actually had the agent re-implement the most popular request which is a table layout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Unfortunately they haven't sent a PR yet so if anybody's working at Claude here we welcome pull requests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway so one thing you may have noticed is I've said AI multiple times so I knew you were not going to last the entire half of the talk without it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So now let's get back to the non AI part of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So this was like in the story we are like in January 1st 2020 and three months later you probably all know what happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">COVID.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so everybody had to go home and now had to figure out like how are you working from home like what's life like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of people one of the big thing that they try to figure out is whiteboarding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when you're in the office you have a physical whiteboard and you can draw stuff and you can collaborate with people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But when you're at home you don't have any of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was very confused because a lot of people like starting coming to me around like oh actually Xcalidraw is a really good whiteboarding solution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like very confused because I built Xcalidraw for drawing illustration for my blog post.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And why what does it have to do with whiteboarding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I started being interested around like okay what are the other people doing whiteboarding like other tools doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And one thing I quickly realized is that all of the tools at the time basically took the physical limitation of whiteboarding and mapped them one to one with the online versions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example a whiteboard like a physical whiteboard has a fixed size.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what everybody did they created a fixed size hey create a new whiteboard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if you run out of space then like you're out of luck.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Now with Xcalidraw you can just like scroll around and like write start writing somewhere else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And it just works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Then the next one is drawing text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so on the physical whiteboard you have to trace every single letter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And on the mouse it's actually very very hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so on Xcalidraw I was like hey like we have a text box like you can select and this is fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I did the dry run for this talk like the people were telling me like there's no way like even MS Paint in like 30 years ago had like keyboard support.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But this was the state of the arts at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And one thing to remember is nobody like thought about online whiteboarding at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So like all the projects were pretty small and like not very used.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And now all of a sudden there's been a huge influx.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is why it was so bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then like the list keeps going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you want to start erasing they will actually have you like erase every single pixel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But on Xcalidraw you can select and delete and it just works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then like I don't know if you've seen like the real TikTok video where like people like draw like perfect circles like this on a blackboard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is like what you had to do for like doing this online.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But with Xcalidraw you can just like select a shape like a circle and like you just draw it and it just works fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally there are things you cannot do on a physical whiteboard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example like copy pasting is like just doesn't work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.980</a></span> | <span class="t">but if you're working online like this is the baseline expectation that you're able to like select and copy paste.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is like all of this like really was the big breakthrough in my mind around the idea of the physical versus virtual whiteboard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is I feel like the same place and time we're in with AI integration right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So in practice what a lot of the integrations today they're basically taking like whatever we're doing right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then like sprinkling AI or re-implementing with AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And the end result is like pretty bad because like hey you don't know how it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But the thing is unlike Xcalidraw and the online like where we had the experience right now we as AI like nobody has experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is why I'm super excited about this conference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Well like all of the people like trying things out actually sharing the lessons to the other with with each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so hopefully like as we keep doing these conferences now we're going to bring the state of the world with AI to be much more much better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So now I talked a lot about like Xcalidraw the early days and everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so a lot of people have been asking us like how do you integrate AI with Xcalidraw and we've tried a bunch of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So now for the second part I'm going to walk through what are the things we've tried, what are the things that have worked, what are the things that haven't worked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first one is actually not us but Gorchem who I think is in the room somewhere working at File AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he discovered this really cool machine learning model that takes an Xcalidraw diagram with like a palm tree or like a sun and then is able to generate real time live picture like beach of the image in reaction to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is like was mind blowing to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Well like oh now like machines can actually generate images and the model is working really well and like the I think the demo is still working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you if you want like you should try it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of the issue is when we started like integrating with Xcalidraw we realized that people don't actually draw realistic images on Xcalidraw.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is one like the first like key lesson that we found is that just because there's a model that exists doesn't mean that it should be within your product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And I know right now like there's a huge pressure for all of us to like just add whatever kind of AI into our product that's like in order to be like AI first and whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But I really like want you to think about like what are the actual AI integrations that actually make sense rather than like hey I just put in AI and that's it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And in practice if you do that then actually like the whole product is going to be like way worse than if you didn't have any AI at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So this was like the first learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Now people do not draw realistic images on Xcalidraw but they do draw diagrams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now the question is okay so LNMs are magical and like they're going to generate diagrams so let's try it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we tried and that didn't work out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is an illustration but in practice it was even worse like there was no resemblance of a house or anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It was just like bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is where like we started realizing that like just doing this wasn't going to cut it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So we need to like be like a bit better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But one thing is yesterday I was chatting with somebody at working at Gemini and he showed me a demo of like Gemini actually outputting Xcalidraw files.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So my talk is already outdated and we probably need to get back and like start coding on this but anyway let's continue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So the thing though that we found out is LNMs were actually able to generate something called Mermaid.js.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the name of the product is super weird but in practice it's a way to describe a diagram.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in this case you're just writing flowchart LRAAI to be engineer and then it draws this specific diagram.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so LNMs were able to like realistically generate this kind of like Mermaid.js syntax.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was really exciting because now what we are able to do is to like encode the knowledge of like the diagram and Mermaid supports like many different types of diagram.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now we're able to like encode all of this and like all of the prompts can actually generate diagrams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Now the challenge is like this output SVG or canvas and not Xcalidraw files.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So what do we do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So in practice I can check it to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so she implemented an Xcalidraw backend for Mermaid.js.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And now we finally have our very first very very successful integration of AI within Xcalidraw.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So now what you can do is to like set a prompt and like put in anything that you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this case a flowchart starts with AI and an engineer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But we've seen people like draw like org chart diagram or TCP or the network request kind of diagram or architecture diagram.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Where you can see like classes and inheritance and those kind of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you get a result which is an actual Xcalidraw component that you can play with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things that is the like the title of my talk is the human and AI partnership.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the things that you've probably been very frustrated is like you start and you generate something that like looks 90% like what you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But then you're like hey this is an image I can't do anything with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is like the magic of this integration with Xcalidraw is now this is just Xcalidraw and you can use Xcalidraw to like make it however you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so for example you can get to something like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Where you start modifying the layout just moving things around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">You start adding colors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And you really make it to where and to what you want to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think this is the mindset that we're going to see more and more with successfully integrations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It's no longer going to be like one shot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey I'm asking the AI something and the AI give me like something perfect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But how do you get something that's close enough and then you as a human can start modifying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so right now this is like a just one way like one run trip operation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But I foresee a future where like now you're going to be able to go back to the AI and say hey modify this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then go to the much further.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't have this right now but this is what I think the future is going to look like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=778" target="_blank">00:12:58.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So now this is one integration so I'm going to go through a few other AI integration that we've been working on within Xcalidraw.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So the next one is one of the things you can do with the SAS offering of Xcalidraw is managing file creating a bunch of different files and syncing in the clouds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And as if you've been using this most of your documents are going to look like untitled one, untitled two, untitled three, untitled four.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things that Ellen can actually be really good at is generating names for these documents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now whenever you're creating a document we wait until you stop working on this so we actually have content.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we're going to prompt you hey these are like all of the names that we think would match and then you just click and then you're done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this way like it actually removes the burden on you to do it and AIs are really good at this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Next one is while people are not using Xcalidraw to generate like good looking like painting kind of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.980</a></span> | <span class="t">They people tend to like want to have like a lot of infographics a lot of illustrations within their slides or like their diagrams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And one thing that we are doing which is in like alpha like close right now but we're going to open source and to ship in a few weeks is the ability to generate illustrations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we are really hyped about this because I think it's going to help a lot of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally the thing that like kills me the most I'm using Xcalidraw every day and I usually want to integrate logos within my diagram or my slides kind of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And I cannot find a reliable way to remove the background from all of the space key logos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just took a screenshot of the AI engineer welfare from the website and I'm like hey please like how do I remove the background.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And the thing that I wanted to do is to challenge all of you like you're all AI engineers and probably some someone from all of you can create a model that removes the background for logos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you're able to make it work within the browser send it to me and we'll make it happen and we like ship it within Xcalidraw.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=913" target="_blank">00:15:13.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm really excited that some of you are going to be able to help us with this and help all of the people using Xcalidraw.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is the end of my talk and I have a few conclusions for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first one is right now as I mentioned we're in the like physical whiteboard to virtual whiteboard like kind of moments happening within like all of the product but specifically like for the design products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And now we need to figure out like what is the AI native way to implement those interactions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so really excited about this conference to like start showing like all of the potential.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">The second one is please please please resist the urge to actually ship all of the random model that exists within your app.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And really only ship the one that like you feel like actually adding to the product and helping your customers getting doing what they actually want to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And the last one is LLM's love structure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're able to take your problem domain from space and find a way to represent it in some kind of domain specific language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Now it's going to be most likely going to work way better to like have the LLM target this domain specific language and then you take this language and without AI you actually output it to your own system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is the end of my talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm really excited that we have this event and conference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm also excited like Steve is going to be talking next about TLDraw.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=1005" target="_blank">00:16:45.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we've been working together for a long time and like he's probably going to blow your mind with all his examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aopgVJBQC0o&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span
