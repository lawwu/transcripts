What does it mean and what can it do for your life by having more of it? So the idea is you're free to be 100% you and do what you want in the world and not be restricted by the cultural field.</p><p>Obviously, you have constraints. There's laws. There's things that don't feel good to your own personal ethics. But most people are in a cage that's much tighter than that. It's, oh, my mom told me I was bothering people when I was young, so I don't wanna bother people. We have all hundreds of little conclusions and if/then statements of how we should be in order to be good, lovable, worthwhile, attractive, all these things.</p><p>And so we're operating in this cage that ultimately, though, it's not really you. And the kicker is you're actually more attractive, more lovable when you step outside of that cage.</p></div></div></body></html>
