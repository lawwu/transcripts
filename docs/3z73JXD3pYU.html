We were on our fourth beer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I thought it was a joke. I think the first thing I thought after I saw the video and saw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that he was okay, and that his ear was bleeding was that's it, it's over. Trump's won. It was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">probably one of the most iconic patriotic visuals I think any of us have seen. And here's the image</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Nick's pulling up. What a photo. This is the AP photographer. And I think it's really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it was so striking. You see this photo, which didn't come out right away. But some of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">imagery that came out right away with him pumping his fist was like, okay, that's it. Trump's won.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's over. Second thing I thought was, this could trigger a lot of violent counter reactions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">If Trump doesn't lead well here, and I think he prevented that in his statements. And from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">other side. Third thing I thought is it doesn't matter if Biden drops out now, because it's over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Biden could stay in, he could leave. This just feels like a lot of momentum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the fourth thing I thought was this, to Chamath's point, I think we've all been around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Secret Service people in our lives and in our careers and in meetings and interactions we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">had, it really was amazing that the Secret Service let this happen.

Certainly, the dust has settled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">five days later. And it seems like they're back into the conversation about let's remove Biden and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">figure out who can run against Trump. Although there is conflicting polling data, which I know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to get to. Let's get Sax's reaction. Sax, where were you when this occurred? And your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">thoughts on the event itself? And obviously, there's tons of conspiracy theories going around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">right now. Obviously, there is some negligence that occurred here. I don't think there's any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">doubt about that. There's a DEI angle. There's a ton of angles here. But where were you when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">saw this happen? And what was your immediate thought?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, well, let me answer your first question. First, I think this was one of those events where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll always remember where you were. And I was just working in my office in Los Angeles. I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">going to fly to the Republican Convention in Milwaukee a few hours later. And so, someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">texted me the President's been shot, Trump had been shot. And my heart sank. I immediately went</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">online to see the video. And I think I saw in almost real time him go down. And then when he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">stood back up and faced the crowd and told the Secret Service, wait, wait, he didn't want to just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">let them kind of drag him away. He turned to face the crowd and exposed his face. Who knows if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">there'd been another shooter? Who knows if that shooter was really down. But in that moment, he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">wanted to let the crowd know that he was fine. We were one inch away from the President of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">United States having his head shot. You know, he's got grandkids, he's got a wife, he's got kids,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">he's got friends, however you feel about the individual, his head was almost shot on television</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in front of thousands, hundreds, maybe thousands of people on live television.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And the gravity of this, I think, is very significant. And I think we've, in this media</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">saturated environment, we've processed it too quick, which is why on the docket, I wanted to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">slow down here and just take in what happened. You know, one other very important detail for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">me is that, you know, my father-in-law was actually at that rally in Butler, at Butler Farm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Really? Yeah, he was there, and he saw everything that happened. And when we saw there was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">shooting there, we were trying to get a hold of him, and the cell reception had been shut down,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and we couldn't get a hold of him for a couple hours. And obviously, we found out later that he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">was fine. But what he described is that when the shots rang out, the President went down,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">there was really a feeling of bedlam and pandemonium in the crowd. The crowd was afraid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that the President had been shot. And so when he stood back up and faced the crowd and then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, said, "Fight, fight, fight," it created this huge sense of relief. It was like palpable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that he was fine. And then the part that I don't think has been well-reported is that the crowd</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">started chanting, "USA, USA, USA." So they responded with this unity. It's been well-reported</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=633" target="_blank">00:10:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that, you know, that Trump said, "Fight, fight, fight," but I don't think it's been well-reported</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that the crowd started cheering, "USA, USA, USA." So I think that the crowd turned from fear to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">unity and strength and patriotism, reflecting what they saw from the President.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">- Yeah, it's well said, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">- This is one of these things that's unbelievable. And the whole world, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">has just seen how iconic it is. I saw there's a video online even, and I think kids in Uganda</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">were actually reenacting the assassination attempt.

Trump's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like a global legend for that. And again, there's just no way to fake what he did in that moment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Where, again, he... I mean, the bullet missing him was either luck or hand of God or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">destiny, whatever you wanna call it, but him telling the Secret Service to stop, to face the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">crowd, to basically show that he was unharmed and that he was determined and he was defiant in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">face of an assassin's bullet, that's courage that nobody can fake.

So number one is how did they fail</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1472" target="_blank">00:24:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to cover that roof?

And then the Secret Service releases the statement that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1482" target="_blank">00:24:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't cover it because it was a sloped roof, which is the most ridiculous cover story ever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1487" target="_blank">00:24:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">because they did have snipers on another roof that was more sloped.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1490" target="_blank">00:24:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's like five times more slope.

And the Secret Service</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1514" target="_blank">00:25:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">director Cheadle said that on ABC.

Okay, so isn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it true that they were inside the the structure was air conditioned inside the building outside</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1530" target="_blank">00:25:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it was.

Question number two is, like you said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1535" target="_blank">00:25:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">he was a person of interest an hour before the shooting.

Moreover, they see him with a rangefinder. Okay, what the hell do you use a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1546" target="_blank">00:25:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">rangefinder for?

And they let the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1552" target="_blank">00:25:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">president go out there.

So clearly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1565" target="_blank">00:26:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">there was a huge failure of communication between the Secret Service and the Trump campaign.

So they had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2287" target="_blank">00:38:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">these rooms set up where there were teleprompters and I could do some training on how to read a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2294" target="_blank">00:38:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">speech using a teleprompter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2296" target="_blank">00:38:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">What is that like?

I said that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2374" target="_blank">00:39:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this was not an unprovoked war.

I think it took</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2406" target="_blank">00:40:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">them a second to process what I had said.

And that line did actually get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2437" target="_blank">00:40:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">applause.

But let's talk about the selection of JD Vance because that is a big surprise, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2502" target="_blank">00:41:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in many quarters.

So JD Vance represents a couple of very interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2519" target="_blank">00:41:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">characteristics. On the one hand, he's from this poor region of Appalachia that really represents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2525" target="_blank">00:42:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the forgotten man or the forgotten cities and towns in America. You could call it the MAGA</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2532" target="_blank">00:42:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">heartland. And so MAGA really likes him. At the same time, he's worked in tech. He was a venture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2537" target="_blank">00:42:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">capitalist. He understands the future and he's popular in tech. So it's very unusual to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2542" target="_blank">00:42:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody who has MAGA plus tech on their side together. So that's one almost contradiction,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2549" target="_blank">00:42:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you could say, that JD represents. Here's another one. JD Vance was in high school</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2554" target="_blank">00:42:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">when the Twin Towers came down.

And he enlisted in the Marine Corps and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2568" target="_blank">00:42:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">he went off to serve in the Iraq War.

He had the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2590" target="_blank">00:43:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">courage to serve, to go serve in America's wars, but he has the wisdom and the judgment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2595" target="_blank">00:43:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to want to avoid those wars when we don't need to fight them.

And they seem on virtually a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2610" target="_blank">00:43:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">daily basis to want to plunge us into the next forever war. So this is, I think, a quality that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2616" target="_blank">00:43:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of paramount importance to have in our commander in chief and in the person who would be next in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2621" target="_blank">00:43:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">line to be commander in chief.

So I don't want to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3779" target="_blank">01:02:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">conspiratorial or anything, but it would be a great way for the GPs to get liquid to meet their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3786" target="_blank">01:03:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">capital calls here without having to pay capital gains tax. And that makes a lot of sense for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3792" target="_blank">01:03:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">GPs themselves. And so I suspect that that probably... Well, they did say that the GPs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3797" target="_blank">01:03:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">aren't going to get to liquidate anything. So they did put that note in there. So they've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3802" target="_blank">01:03:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">anticipated that. Right, so you can provide... No, but what that means is you can provide liquidity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3807" target="_blank">01:03:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't get to pull the money out, that's fine. But then now you can use it to fund capital calls.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3810" target="_blank">01:03:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But I don't like it.

You're supposed to go and get some other random fund to buy these things. And I think it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3833" target="_blank">01:03:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">generally a much cleaner thing to do.
