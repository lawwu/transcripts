China<br><h3>Transcript</h3><div class='max-width'><p>over lunch this individual told me you know every founder and every vc in china studies the west at a nauseating level so they listen to all the podcasts they read everything they possibly can they study any speech they look at the financials and he said the west doesn't do that of china and you know maybe we should be maybe we should be studying the best and the brightest over there hey bill great to see you good to see you brian summer has just blown past it's all it's almost football season yes uh how are the longhorns looking this year um they rank pretty high what's that mean come on give me the scoop i know i know you're all over that people that know know but they they have the dangerous starting position of being ranked number one in the country oh wow wow any big games coming up they uh play the number two team in the country this saturday and so we're gonna find out we're gonna find out we're gonna find out oh it gets real fast back to buckeye country yeah exactly it's been really incredible uh you know i just i just got back to silicon valley um after you know being away for a few weeks these you know the open ai deal the anthropic deal i was just looking at these i think these are bigger private ipos than any public ipo uh done in the last five years in the tech market right you had sam say the other day sam altman say you know two two things can be simultaneously true um one that this is the biggest thing to have ever happened in technology but number two uh that in the short run things become overheated and people are can get a little bit ahead of themselves where are you on that look there's just no denying that the amount of capital that is going into these companies earlier in their life and the scale of hiring and their willingness to take on risk which i think you can use cash burn as just a proxy for risk because you get further away from knowing unit economics and and you're more threatening you know i i think what those numbers are unprecedented like even against you know the uber doordash wars and all this they're bigger than that and so i think it's part of we've talked about it i think it's part of a systematic trend where investors are aware of network effects they've watched companies that get the initial conditions right go on to really big outcomes and they're willing to bet ahead of the curve and as the more confident they get over more time the more they're willing to make that bet ahead of time and um and so you know it is what it is we're seeing you know massive numbers well i'd say it's it's a combination of two things extraordinary scaling we've never seen two companies in the case of open ai scale uh users and scale revenue as fast as they are but definitely you're absolutely right the private markets are there to meet them um and we're seeing the depth and the breadth of capital and investment in the private markets i think unlike anything we've ever seen but you know we're going to save that for yeah save it right let's save it we're gonna save it let's save that for another day we're gonna do something a little different today um you know one topic that i think um we we've hit on time and time again but we're gonna we're really just try dedicate the show to it today and that's china you know you just got back from china it's one of the hottest in many ways most consequential and also most controversial debates i think in silicon valley and in washington you know on the one hand you have i think national security economic hawks you know who are in this camp that we should decouple it's a a little bit more cold war 2.0 yeah a great power struggle this is the meersheimer perspective you know maybe in the middle you have you know tech pragmatists i guess i i might call them you know like jensen wang or tim cook i'd probably put myself in this camp who thinks we we have to compete we have to re-onshore industry you probably should have some tariffs in order to achieve that but you you definitely can't decouple or ignore or or antagonize and then maybe on the other end you have kind of the globalists i don't know jeff sacks jeffrey sacks is probably in this camp it's free trade open science collaboration and you know there's this is of tremendous consequence to issues around tariffs and trade issues around military issues around ai and there's this new book out by dan wang that i want to talk about um you know uh where where he really takes on the differences between the two countries but why don't we start with you know this trip that you recently took you know you you just got back from china why did why did you go you know and frankly especially given all the you know blowback you've gotten personally benchmarks gotten uh with respect to china maybe for having too soft of you on china give me your inspiration for wanting to go and spend as much time as you did studying china yeah so i i've probably been four or five times before this trip but i hadn't been since um covet and i've been reading you know about everyone that's been going we talked about thomas friedman's comments um from his last trip and you hear about all the things that are different um you know personally my my daughter's an asian studies major so she went on the trip with with myself and my wife and so you know you know with her studying that topic this is i thought it'd be a great chance for her to see things too um much younger than us but i wanted her to go around and the fact that she speaks mandarin was helpful on on the trip as well but you you know you just said something right you said this is probably the most consequential you know other nation when it comes to thinking about america or thinking about our stock markets or thinking about how technology companies are evolving and so i just wanted to learn like like like why wouldn't you want to know more i don't understand how you if it is the most consequential relationship for our country why you'd want to know less right and so um i've always enjoyed going over there i've always enjoyed learning things that i don't know um and i really wanted to see it up close and personal um one thing that was super helpful was uh dan wang who you just mentioned gave me a early copy of his book so i read it on the way over there tell us tell us a little bit who is dan wang so um it's a gentleman that lived over there he lived over there during covid um you know he's a he's a policy analyst um and he recently moved back to the u.s um he's at the hoover institute yeah been studying china for a long time looks at it through the lens of technology and innovation and the book's titled breakneck and it's really talking about some of the acceleration um that we've seen in in building you know inside of china but but it i would suggest the two things about the book that are really interesting one he kind of uses as a mirror back on the u.s so it's really about both countries it's not just about china um and then two he's balanced like he talks about the pros you know and the cons of what have happened over there he starts with with this chapter that was recently republished in the atlantic where he highlights that the vast majority of the political borough are former engineers so this is the the ruling party within china and that the vast majority of the people in washington dc are former lawyers and you know that he uses that lens to say this is why they're great at building things and maybe why they're not so great at social things i think he gives the edge to having the lawyers to protecting free speech and personal rights he did not enjoy the lockdown in shanghai which was fairly abrupt um he's very negative on the one child policy and for those people that don't know the the chinese government's now trying to encourage people to have three children not successfully but that's the new program um so they've completely flipped from where they were um but but it's a fascinating read it's a very personal read you can tell that you know his life journey his parents were born there and left you know and went to canada and that's how he grew up in the west and then he went back and so he has it's i think it's a really interesting lens but it's very very current one of the things he really dives into and this is something that that people that i've talked to you that know china have known this for some time but i don't think the general people understand this so one of the things that's led to the vast build out so we've read about high speed trains we've read about overnight cities we've read about their number of companies in the solar space in the ev space one of the reasons that happens is the provincial leaders compete with each other so the provinces are very competitive with one another not in the same way the states are really um one of the reasons this is true is if you run a province and do well you put yourself in really good standings to move up in the federal government but wouldn't you say that's it i mean that seems to me like gavin newsom competing you know with desantis in florida on you know who is more business friendly who is tougher on immigration it seems a little bit the same way i think it's a little bit the same way but the difference is that because there's a singular government that's going to make choices like like in the u.s if you do well as a governor you might get elected got it but in this case it's more like divisions of a company and if you run one well you might get the ceo job and and so that competition you know leads to overbuild in certain cases so there's several ghost cities um that that are buildings that are empty you know where they've built too fast they are now facing problems even though they're the world leader in evs and the world leader in solar panels where some of these companies need to go bankrupt and a province may not want them to because of employment issues right and so the the those are the those are flip you know two sides of a coin you get one benefit you get hyper competition we talked about the thousand flowers bloom so this the the federal government publishes every five years this this mandate of the things these are the things that are important and you need to go work on and then the provinces you know go go at it like they go right against those initiatives and that's that's how they've got taken a lead in those things we mentioned and energy production right you wonder we talk about all the number of nuclear plants that they have new nuclear starts solar farms wind farms i'm going to dig into that bill i think there's this general view that china's good at building things building iphones but perhaps not at innovating right and then you know jensen huang reminded us recently that 50 percent of the world's ai researchers are in china and they're indeed innovating and not copying you know on the ground when you look at the things happening in auto when you look at the things happening in ai when you look at that things happening in space or energy etc um how would you compare contrast as a venture capitalist the level of rigor and innovation and excitement enthusiasm um and investment i guess going on against these you know critical future industries well if you're over there you you know that the bite dance founder is just remarkably unique you know leijun at jami is remarkably unique and if you spend time um studying those people i just i don't know how you would possibly think that they can't innovate i mean tick tock was there first right and then it came here and then reels copied tick tock one thing that doesn't seem like innovation but i was surprised by pop mart is a uh 40 50 billion dollar public company which is a children's toy company that started in china and is everywhere over there but like just the idea that that there is no innovation you know one one of my favorite meetings and i promised i would protect the innocent so i'm not going to share who it was with but over lunch this individual told me you know every founder and every vc in china studies the west at a nauseating level so they listen to all the podcasts they read everything they possibly can they study any speech they look at the financials and he said the west doesn't do that of china and you know maybe this goes back to my main motivation for going over there to learn but that i thought that was a very provocative statement that he made you know and um maybe we should be maybe we should be studying the best and the brightest over there well let's say let's dive into you know maybe one industry i i guess as a lens yeah i know you spent a bunch of time uh in the auto industry yeah right looking at all of these new entrants and i would help us understand the innovation that's happening there are two dimensions one on uh you know just electric vehicles number two on you know maybe autonomy and then number three i'm just curious like how tesla is able to compete so effectively you know in a market where you have this hyper competition uh for electric vehicles yeah so i i i had a number of auto experiences when i was over there first of all i i was invited to um visit byd this is my they gave me a nice coat i um i met with stella lee who is their number one executive i think facing outside of china um she runs all their europe initiatives for those people that don't know byd is the largest ev manufacturer in the world at about four million vehicles um they started in batteries they they you know they compete in with uh foxconn to build mobile phones they bought jabel circuit you remember that old company i do and they make lots of things they make buses and subways and all kinds of different things but they got into cars uh over i don't know about five to ten years ago um they have a number of models they gave me this one this is you know a very kind of high-end sports car in fact i met a public company ceo that was proudly showing me this was his favorite car that he drives around they make an suv you can drive into the water wait i don't i don't know exactly why you'd want to do that but we rode it into the water drove around in the water and drove out um they have cars at 10 to 15 grand price point on the entry side they've hired a european designer it's just how they're building stuff like this um on the higher end um and um they're very aggressive from a cost perspective yeah i think byd more than anyone on the cost side it's not preventing them from building higher in cars as well um so that's byd i also had a chance to visit xiaomi they also gave me a car the uh the xiaomi is a super interesting story if people don't know so i i would i was fortunate enough to meet leijun back in 03-04 um but about 13 10 to 13 years ago he started a phone company and that's what xiaomi is and that company's now third i think around the globe and handsets sold heavy in europe heavy in south america not just china um and three to four years ago i think around 2021 he decided to build a car and it was about the same time apple said they were going to build a car and and mind you this guy was back in 03 ran an e-commerce company called joio like like he's he wasn't i there's no reason he he should be able to build a phone and then build a car so what do you attribute that to bill like why you know when you see that you know again going back to dan wang's book he's like this is an engineering culture that has built these technological ecosystems that gives rise to a higher velocity of innovation uh you know than we see in the united states that dan would argue is bogged down by you know regulatory capture and lawyers etc why do you think uh you know xiaomi is so successful and by the way let me just share with you some numbers so so they're making uh a thousand of these a day they just came out with a kind of a kind of a thousand cars a day yeah in in this in the factory that i went to um it it it they're sold out they have like a 30 to 40 week backlog um you have to pay five grand to get on the waiting list the factory this is an interesting data point the factory makes a thousand cars a day with two thousand employees um it was highly automated like really highly automated i imagine that they plan to improve that number over the next five years let's say they took it to a thousand employees for a thousand cars that'd be employed per car per day that number is like at six in the u.s and that's super interesting for a number of things like if you want to bring the jobs back there by the time you get the jobs back there may not be any jobs like like at one because of automation the entire global you know potential for car manufacturing in five or ten years from now could be like 400k total and so you know we we we just need to be really thoughtful about those things but but back to lejun he gave a talk in 2024 we're talking about maybe people should be watching and learning in both directions that i would encourage people to watch it's on youtube it's his state of the union from 2024 and he spends about an hour talking about his approach to building a car and it sounded like so ridiculously i don't like like you ask about entrepreneurial he he he decided that he hadn't been driving a car for 10 years because he had had a driver so he immediately switched seats with his driver and then he um he went through the parking lot at his company and if there was ever a car he had not driven he'd leave a note on it and ask to borrow it and then he would have the uh the owner of the car tell him what they liked and didn't like so he claimed he drove 170 cars that way um and then he also like byd they hired a european designer um that came in and helped him out but for an entrepreneur who had never been in a car business to build a factory in a three-year window and look the same thing was true our friend omid built a factory in texas you know you know under 40 like just spectacular that that that these entrepreneurs are capable of doing these things but it just kind of blows my mind like when i was being driven in this golf cart through this factory just thinking that this person wasn't in the business three or four years ago and for for people that don't know i'd encourage you to go online and and so uh the ceo of ford farley he went over there and i think had the exact same tour i did and he insisted they ship him one back to chicago and he's been driving it around and he's made some pretty extreme statements um after having experienced john me this car sells for about 40k but he said it's the most humbling thing i've ever seen and he says even beyond that their cost their quality of vehicles is far superior to what i see in the west we are in a global competition with china and it's not just evs if we do not if we lose this we do not have a future at ford you know that that's farley at ford you know and and i by the way i would take a pause after mentioning that to the people that are gonna um accuse just because i went over there to learn accused me of somehow being like a an agent for the ccp is that also true of the ceo of ford you know like why is he saying these things like we're just witnessing what's happening on the ground one of my observations is and you hear this from elon you hear this from jensen huang you hear this from tim cook you hear it from farley it's extreme respect for the for the level of innovation um for the focus for the engineering led culture that exists in china and that to me one of the reasons i wanted to do this pod on china is because i think it's as much a reflection about what the united states needs to do to re-engineer its own society right it's not enough to say that we want to re-onshore critical manufacturing it really is about you know this movement around american exceptionalism america builds it's about making the reforms necessary whether it's regulatory capture whether it's the you know tort reform legal reform required to frankly allow uh uh you know this level of innovation and recognize that we're in this global competition you know and there are two ways in which you can you can approach this bill one is we can build barriers we can try to decouple and we can pretend the rest of the world somehow won't buy china's goods you know but if you look at it today the u.s only represents about 14 percent of china's exports the u.s only represents about three percent of china's gdp yeah right so like we're just not that important to china i don't want to understate like you know we're still very significant but china has found a market in europe they found a market in africa they found a market in south america right and it it seems to me that the harder pill for the us to swallow and this is where i think that you know i i'm in the camp of of those in the middle who say we need to engage we need to compete there is a competition we want to win the competition but this is about focusing on us and winning and running a faster race we have a lot of reforms i think a lot are occurring now i think we're doing the type of things that we need to be doing um in order to get more globally competitive there are industries that are critical to our national security um you know things like rare earth magnets things like uh you know steel productions things like pharmaceuticals where i think it is appropriate to have both an industrial policy and a tariff policy that's going to provide the incentives to those industries um but it it's you know to me uh you know the reflection on what i hear you saying about china when i read dan's book is that china is putting the accelerator to the floor in terms of innovation and it's in every single industry it's powered by you know the this provincial competition you talked about is powered by people who are just you know naturally entrepreneurial and hard-working um and there's no escaping that and there's no putting that genie back in the box would you know what are your thoughts on that yeah no i think it's exactly right i mean byd has um a big presence in hungary and they have a fact they're building a factory in or already have one in mexico and why if you're mexico would you not buy the 10 to 20 grand ev why would you buy the 50 grand one from america it just doesn't make any sense right like you're if for any country around the world and i could reflect this on the us as well if you're not gonna buy you know domestically you you should certainly buy from the low-cost producer right it goes back to to comparative advantage right if you if you can't produce a globally competitive product and you close your import border your people are forced to buy a product that is overpriced and and and not and and so from a from a standard of living perspective they're worse off than they would be if you had opened the import door and so i don't you know i'll give you another example of this so this is the the byd this is the apollo um competitor to waymo so we we've we've seen the waymos around austin and san francisco we've ridden in them this is i've ridden in this now um it's a little bigger i think a little roomier than than than the jaguar for sure um it's more of an suv um but this is on the streets you know and apollo is kind of interesting it's inside of baidu which is a search engine company um while people are simultaneously what people are saying that that the waymos should be worth 170 billion inside of of google you can buy shares of baidu for zero enterprise value it's a 30 billion market cap 30 billion in cash on the books um and from a global perspective i don't know why if this is 30k why you'd want to deploy waymos which people say are over 150k partially due to the to the mem solid state lidar advantage that china has which we've talked about previously so yeah i think rest of world is a really interesting thing to think about you know when you compare the two countries because i don't think that i i personally and i i don't have a ton of data on this but i i personally don't think all the other countries in the world share the same level of hawkishness that at least part of the members of our national government have and so i don't think they're going to be as afraid of their technologies let's think about this in the context of you know uh uh uh what you've seen if you were giving advice to trump uh on export controls for example bill um you know whether it's on you know ai chips or other things um you know would you be uh you know what would your advice be well i mean i think you hit on some of it around the red tape and you know there's a couple different things in certain industries where we're really behind i would be very open-minded to jvs coming towards us you know for the past 50 years you know european car manufacturers u.s car manufacturers they opened facilities in china some of them were forced to be 49 owned 51 owned i'd be very open to that kind of thing um there was some positive news out this past week um following trump's engagement with korea around nuclear which we have talked about before korea can build a nuclear plant for one-fourth the price that we can why don't you invite them to come help us build a few in the u.s and see what we can learn and i wonder if we should allow for there's going to be there are so many ev companies i didn't even mention you know neo and zeeker and some of these other things they're all innovating in different ways but some of those are going to have financial trouble neo's public you can see that that the stock's not doing all that well but would we let a ford or a gm buy one of those companies right maybe we should i don't know if the china government would let them would we let one of those companies open a jv with ford or gm in the u.s i think we should if we'd learn from it and you could say the same thing about solar or any of these technologies where they have a lead solar nuclear so i would be open-minded to those types of things um i would be really big on trying to get regulation out of the way and recognizing that that an autocratic country that has specific goals can move so much faster um in any industry than you ever could in the u.s because we've created so many people whose jobs that are to block things um and we're seeing i think we're seeing that type of behavior in certain states which is why tsmc's in arizona which is why tesla's in texas i would give governor shapiro a lot of credit um for reopening three mile island and what he did with i-95 like like all those things are signs of recognizing that we've built mud you know in in our system um that prevents building and how do you how do you get how do you start to remove that and move in the opposite direction specifically uh you know thinking about the tariff so you know i think that the president uh tweeted yesterday morning if you know if we don't get it was appearing that we're on a glide path and making a lot of progress with china we may very well be i think he tweeted yesterday morning that if we don't get rare earth magnets from china he could raise the tariff rate to 200 percent there was some talk that he was going to visit china in the first week of september so that's you know right around the corner um i said on a couple pods ago i thought that you know the way to understand uh this president is that he's a self-described deal junkie he's a pragmatist he's not an ideologue it seems to me that when he's talking with jensen huang and others he falls in that kind of pragmatic centrist category um he certainly wants to rebuild stuff in the united states but at the same time it appears to me he wants to get a big deal done on china where do you come down again if you were advisor on the tariff side of things bill um do you think he's going to get a big deal done with china do you think that's the right thing uh to do and how do you think that influences uh some of the building that you're talking about okay this is i have zero insight like i didn't i didn't i didn't meet with anyone in the in the ccp or the government so i have no idea what with their mindset this is pure speculation on my my point my part um you already brought up the fact that that we're a much smaller percentage of their exports than people realize and people think about and as a result you know i think that they're going to be china is going to be far more um biased by what they view as as fair and and face-saving than they are necessarily like numeric and so i think if we if someone were to approach them in a pragmatic way i think a pragmatic deal could easily get done i you know if they are engineers as dan wang said i it's not like you know that they wouldn't accept a pragmatic outcome i think they would but if we um if we're intent on being derogatory in our language and and by the way that's the thing that i just really don't understand um that you see in washington you see it on that select committee of the ccp and you see it from some of the the the people in silicon valley i just don't understand the value of being uh belligerent and but but many people clearly are i mean they have four times the number of citizens on this earth than we do and um none everybody's you know country of birth is something that happens to them outside of their control so i i just don't know why vilifying uh a billion people is a good idea um so i think it's possible i think there's a i think they would do a deal um and i just don't know if uh if we get caught up in a silly tit-for-tat verbal war what the benefit of that is and anything like that and this is one of the points sacks makes um jeffrey sax not david you you you might provoke world war three so what do you what what do you what's how do you put that into your mpv calculation is it fair to say that you know i think if you look at tariffs um heading into this year they basically doubled on china but if we put tariffs on you know particular industries in order to incent uh building and industries in the united states imagine it was a deal a bit like japan bill where we also you know cut a deal with the chinese that they had a trillion dollars of investment the way we have with other companies that go into the u.s into some of these uh you know industries and that we perhaps get some reciprocity and reduction of barriers to some chinese goods into into china where how would you handicap that did you get any sense um uh or or or you know do you get any sense from the uh the stuff you read in the united states as to the the probability that i think it's one of the biggest influences as we look at growth in the back half of this year as we look at market sentiment in the back half of this year just curious where you stand on that ironically one of the things that i mean like i said i met with i met with companies and founders and and and a few academicians but i did and some journalists but i didn't meet with with the government but in general there's just not any hostility from their side from that group of people that i met with in fact most of those um most of those people look up to the u.s founders that have done great things the jobs and the elons and most of them aspire to compete globally the same way a founder in the u.s would like and so they would like to see all this rhetoric die down and they would like to have the opportunity to come to the u.s market they'd like the opportunity to compete in europe and south america many are xiaomi and byd already are and so i think like i said i think there's a pragmatic deal to do um to the extent and and if if that um led to the types of programs that i just talked about this kind of jv thing where there's a market there a leader in and we you know have that company come to the u.s and help us understand um how to compete in some of these technologies and get to lower price points i think that'd be fantastic do you feel like over the last 20 years who do you think's gotten the best out of the relationship bill you know i haven't read this uh apple china book um yes it a lot of people have been talking about it and i aim to um it it i think the problem with looking at it that way is you know you and i've talked about this finite versus infinite game is you know where are we in the time of the planet and what do you think the planet's going to look like you know 15 20 30 years from now i mean i think it'd be very easy to say you know using your framing to say the u.s took advantage of europe post-world war ii and a lot of the manufacturing that existed prior to world war ii shifted to america um and so you could then with that same frame say yeah china you know grew on the back of america and and you know from from that time but i kind of look at it another way which is there have been different periods where these different countries have industrialized you know we were a huge beneficiary post-world war ii because most of asia and in europe had been blown up and there was no production capability whatsoever and a lot of the kind of glory day mindset that we have about what life and generational change should be like in the u.s come from that time um which is a bit unfair i think from a global perspective but there's a ton of hard-working people over there you know denxiaoping brought capitalism underneath the uh the chinese government and led to the biggest you know um increase in standard of living of any it's like 500 million people came out of poverty as a result of that and you know when people say oh we should have never let the jobs go over there i'd i don't think they really want to say well we shouldn't have let 500 million people out of poverty uh you know it's the same people that that uh want to talk about aid in africa and whatnot so a lot of people benefited in china um but they're also hard-working people and and and we we talk a lot about meritocracies right and some of the same people that talk about meritocracies are anti-china and so that that's a hard thing to square because if someone's willing to work twice as hard you know as you and you know willing to study harder and and all that kind of stuff are they do they not deserve a chance at a life like you have i think the bigger complaint is that um we were naive in our trade policy and therefore we allowed huge advantages to flow to other areas and you know by the way as dan says in his book at the same time we were actually moving to more of a regulatory state in the united states so you know like our companies were getting less competitive at the same time we were helping their companies get more competitive and there was a lot of collateral damage in the united states in the united states during that period of time and i think right now people are saying okay we're moving into this age of ai but we have to get back to driving reform in the united states that levels that playing field a bit um and so you know you can't you can't undo the past um but i do think there's a recognition that um you know we need to do the things in order to incentivize u.s industry to compete more effectively in a lot of these different categories um i think it is going i think it is going to be tricky though you know if you say you know you've got a hundred competitors in the ev industry in china they're all willing to work on razor thin margins and they're willing to sell cars into europe at twenty thousand dollars or twenty five thousand dollars today as farley said there is not a u.s manufacturer sans perhaps tesla that comes anywhere close to being able to compete in that way on a global basis correct one thing i've been studying a bit is i i do think that the chinese government's more has more scrutinous of monopolies you know i don't think that they i think they would consider it a negative if there were seven companies worth three trillion dollars or whatever like i don't think they care about market cap i think they care more about employment and global competitiveness which would cause you to support low margin companies um and and you know they they get to choose to make that choice i'm not judging it but it would result in this outcome you know there's in addition to the farley quote the mercedes ceo said we need a reality check um when he was talking about chinese evs and then stelantis i guess is the new name who uh who rolled up a bunch of other car companies uh they said chinese evs are quote possibly the biggest risk facing his car maker and tesla um and uh he criticized this is carlos tavares he publicly criticized eu tariffs on chinese electric vehicles calling them a major trap for automakers and this is this is you know you talk about what policy would fix things i'll tell you what policy will make things worse you know you start protecting us industries by putting export tariffs on the most competitive products around the world which i talked about earlier now your consumers don't have access to those price points and so you're buying inferior goods at inflated prices and that's going to lead to inflation and prosperity and standard of living levels dropping in the us so there's a lot of variables i would say that's generally true i think if there's a moment you know if there was a national strategy to improve competitiveness in an industry that had been you know um uh uh let's just say had an unfair playing field for a period of time like i could see a national strategy for example we talked about pharmaceutical manufacturing we talked about chip manufacturing we talked about rare earths where you would say okay we're going to actually impose a tariff because these other goods are flooding and it deprives us of the ability to build our own domestic industry but i think we have to be very careful when you do that bill to your point we know that unfettered competition will lead to uh you know is going to lead to much better products much lower prices and when you start protecting these industries what i worry about is you protect the regulatory grift and the the the the over lawyering that dan talks about in his book right we got to face up to this fact that we have to reform some of these uh you know basic things in the united states and that's why you see companies like tesla moving to texas where those reforms are moving forward and i think you know i think we are making progress on that but i you know i think you there is a rationale uh for those critical national industries but i generally agree with you that if we move to high levels of protection because we simply can't compete because it takes you know us uh you know 10 people uh in an auto plant to do what they do with one person in an auto plant i think that's unsustainable you and i think we need to be careful with the rhetoric we throw around so so i'll give an example so um if you read what comes out of the biggest talks they say well everyone in china just steals things and the government subsidizes everything so when i i brought that up with uh i brought up the subsidization with stella lee at byd and she said she said if i'm getting all this government subsidy money can you please find it and show it to me we're we're a public company come show me the money i'm getting from the government she's like say i'm getting nothing and um and and then you know you look at the u.s like we give companies subsidies all the time to build factories we've had ev credits for the past 10 years both at a state and a federal level um intel's getting money from the u.s government like i don't understand where we're saying like like it's very unclear to me like what we're pointing at and accusing and why it doesn't it isn't the same thing here and then lastly you know elon's published all the tesla patents okay so there's free ip for ford and gm and i would ask you with that free ip if we gave ford and gm subsidies do you think they'd immediately be competitive with china no sir okay and if i ask a hundred smart investors that question what would they say i think they'd agree with me yeah so so so so the thing we're accusing them of being the reason they're succeeding if you flipped and gave that to the u.s companies none of us have confidence that would work so that's what i'm saying just gotta try and get as much information as you can learn as much as you can um so that you i i just want people to have a pragmatic view and an accurate view as they make decisions i i did a deep dive on on your favorite product chat gbt uh 300 version deep research and on the 24 members of the select committee for the ccp and i think all but four have never been to china all right and the ones that went it was seven years ago i just encourage them to go visit if they're going to sit there and have um such strong opinions it'd be good if they were educated i wouldn't want if you were putting together a committee inside of your corporation um that's going to be in charge of something wouldn't you want the most educated people on that committee i can already hear the criticism oh yeah um you know of course people would say well we don't expect the ceo of byd to tell you the truth necessarily about government subsidies or or things like that um but here's the one thing i want to get across in you know kind of this pragmatist camp we do have to be self-reflective right i mean if we have this if we have this view the only reason china's competitive or winning is because they're they're stealing or they're subsidized i think what that view does is it allows us to delude ourselves into believing we don't need to get better ourselves yeah like it's like if you're playing a competition and you know your your kids out there playing in a football game or a swimming race and they lose the race and they come back to you and they say well the only reason that person won was you know they cheated you know like your advice i think is no you've got to get better yourself we've got to get better how can we get better and i think that's why cultivating this balanced and realistic view of china what's actually happening on the ground how hard right folks are working what the level of innovation is the fact that the united states is is is a diminishing part of their trade of their gdp etc i think that should cause us to look a little bit inward about how the hell do we accelerate how do we build more how do we invest more how do we you know get more globally competitive why does it cost us four to five times to build a fission reactor in this country why are we building no nuclear reactors in this country and so the good news is this i feel like there's a lot of momentum under this administration that was building before this administration around investing in america getting more globally competitive right a lot of people want to build things here again you know and and and you got you have somebody like jensen huang who says both can be true we need to sell h20s and b30s into china we need to stay relevant in their ecosystem but at the same time we need to build plants in arizona and we need to rehabilitate and invest aggressively in our own domestic chip program those things can be simultaneously true um and it it's interesting that all of those ceos who spend the most time competing in china you know they all fall in that pragmatist realist camp um you know in the center about you know the united states needs to get serious about the work that it needs to do if it wants to remain globally competitive with that said bill can we shift for a second i want to i want to you know look at this through the lens of kind of just what's going on in ai you know um i know you spent a bunch of time over there looking at the key players on the model side on the you know thinking about the chip side etc um so maybe just round out that other conversation and then shift there yeah so so um one thing one thing to note that um that isn't in the dan wing book but i i think that we can infer from it the government every five years publishes this five-year plan the last one was the 14th and i think the next one will be coming out soon i would encourage everyone to read that because that's where they tell the provinces what's important to work on and that historically has led to these areas where they're investing heavily and they might make a mistake in what they say to focus on but when they've gotten it right it's led to a lot of global competitiveness so i would watch that but in the in the last one in the 14th they literally talked about open source um and so you know i i'll put a link in i found a document that covers all the history of chinese open source but it goes back 20 years this isn't an overnight thing um and our government recently said they were pro open source in this new ai executive order but but but this was kind of pushed out to the provinces and so two two things i would say about the ai market there first of all no one's particularly concerned about there being a monopolist because there's so many open models so there's in general i think from the entrepreneur's perspective um a more relaxed you know opinion because they can work on products and they can take in all these different models i think i think deep seek has the most kind of intellectual brand because of how that arrived and and and almost the the the national pride that came along with it um quinn um is a really important player mainly because uh alibaba leads in the cloud market over there they're about us you you may you and your team may know more of these stats than me brad but i think they're like a 70 player in the cloud market and so that just gives them a natural place to deliver models from that makes them important and then on the consumer side you know byte dance it seems to be the company to watch on anything consumer and they already have an app if someone said whose app is closest to open ais in china it's already an app from byte dance um that's out there people on the watch list people are very curious if 10 cents gonna do something you know obviously they wechat still extremely um important in china and so that's a great asset if they were to bring something but they haven't been particularly aggressive and then jami because of leijun everybody wonders what he might do and you know owning the phone and that big a market share might give you some advantages we've talked about that with the us players so that's kind of that's what i would say is the state of affairs over there on and when it comes to ai on the model layer um is it do you think there's an acknowledgement or a belief uh that they're basically they have the tools they have the chips you know with huawei etc to be competitive like is there a sense in china that you know quinco is going to be competitive with clod code um you know we know they're all open source do you think there is a sense that they all stay at the frontier like i had that since before i went just because of the number of competitive open source models and the way they can trade train each other you just have a much more natural environment to have this kind of hyper competition that we talked about in evs or solar like having that many open source providers gives you that i would say even maybe more because of the way the models can help one another at least in the ev case like you can't take someone else's ev and make yours better but here you can can we talk about that just open for a second let me double click on this you know obviously we saw open ai open source you know a model a few weeks back now we have comments this week out of elon uh they're they're getting back to more aggressively open sourcing um you've obviously got meta already uh uh you know with llama out there on the open source front and i saw you had a tweet yesterday maybe bill just on you were surprised that google had not taken a more aggressive position with respect to open sourcing gemini um do you think they will why do you think they haven't and why do you think it would be the right thing for them to do that well i i had some replies to that tweet to get into this but this goes back to where you started the podcast i don't think public companies understand or i don't think they've internalized um and and really come to terms with the fact that the private markets are willing to bet so aggressively on these new players and i you know we're talking about ai today but this could be true of any new disruption in the future when i was going through the the uber lift wars and you know we'd be in board meetings and look at these burn rates and all this money we're spending you talk about whether or not to raise another round and certainly thought about doing what sam did and trying to talk capital out of the market which never seems to work um but you get frustrated with that game and you want to you know but but you're dealing with business decisions that you would never see in another industry and so getting back to the question you asked you know i just don't know like if everything's at stake for google should they be willing to lose five or ten billion dollars because the startup that's attacking their space is willing to lose that amount of money and i think it's it's it's an ironic situation we're in where the private markets and the startups are willing to be more aggressive perhaps and more risk-seeking than the public incumbents are and i think you know our friend rich barton took a lot of heat at zillow when he when he chased opendoor but he was faced with a situation where a private company was claiming it was gonna out innovate him and disrupt his game and and some of wall street had come to believe that and so he engaged and he played that game on the field now that eventually turned out to not be true um and and maybe if he hadn't engaged competitively with opendoor maybe they wouldn't have have kind of tripped and fallen but but it was probably the right thing to do and i don't think a lot of public companies think that way now google historically when it came to aws open source kubernetes and went after him when it came to apple they open sourced android and certainly some of their their lower models are open sourced and competitive on open router but maybe they should be more aggressive even still because of what's at stake that was that was my point okay shifting back real quick and you know we'll round up here on china um you know the vc market in china we just rewind the clock you know not it was not that long ago bill um and you know there was a lot of us enthusiasm there were a lot of us firms investing directly in china um right from sequoia to ggv a lot of those firms either shut down or spun off their operations uh you know in china benchmark has taken a lot of you know heat for doing an investment manis that you know i've i've read benchmark explain really isn't even you know based in china what do you see you know when you were there do you see a lot of us investors actively investing on the venture side in china and then what is the chinese venture ecosystem look like so a couple different things so first of all um there's a real lack of westerners for all my trips this was the the fewest westerners that i've ever seen and the high-end hotels and the high-end restaurants were fairly empty um and i think that it just has to do with the thawing of the relationship um that's caused less travel from westerners um the vc market um is in a bit of a lull because when when these policies all changed and when you know the jack ma thing happened when dd got pulled back from the u.s markets when the for-profit education companies got taken out and when uh you know wechat went i mean tencent went flat for a couple years because of games reforms all those things um took a lot of air out of the system and caused a lot of people to reconsider and then you also had and i don't even know if this was more led by the u.s government or the china government you had the splitting of the venture capital firms sequoia split in half ggv split in half and and so there are much fewer western dollars available to invest in china and so you know there are a few firms that have stayed you know neil shin at hongshan had raised a ton of money right before all this happened he's very active has a huge staff of people um anafang and zen fun which is a angel group are very active and idg is highly present and has been active but that's only three firms you know and compared to where things were six years ago when every one of our um competitors in the venture industry were making an annual trip it's it's kind of night and day um and then there's not that many um r b dollars available to the venture market a lot of the you don't have the foundations in and university endowments that you do here and the billionaires that have made wealth typically are looking to diversify offshore and so you just don't have a lot of r b dollars seeking a home and now you have the provinces entering the investment space which is an uncomfortable reality for some of the vcs they're asked i hear they're asking for terms that you and i would consider um non-starters you know um and so that's it's all a little bit messy um it's funny because it's simultaneously with some of these markets evs uh autonomous uh robotics where they're where the country is doing extremely well so i found those things off a little bit and it's very everyone's very aware that if the government decides um your company is doing something that's not in the best interest of the uh citizenry that that's going to get corrected and so there's a phrase i don't know if it was in dan's book or i read somewhere else called don't be the tallest tree that's a problem for you yeah exactly um yeah is it in that regard do you think you know that's what i was i was wondering you know there seems to be a ton of entrepreneurial activity despite the fact that you know vcs have retreated that you have companies that are not going public and have been shut down you have entrepreneurs that have gone missing it doesn't really seem to have diminished you know the activity around uh you know around ai as we're talking about clearly or startups or entrepreneurism and in fact a lot of the locals heavily dispute that financial times graph that was going around about the number of startups they said it just mismeasured the whole thing and so no i i don't sense that there's any lack of enthusiasm from entrepreneurs and towns like shenzhen um where where dgi and byd and huawei are all located i mean that town is a new young 20 million people a highly energetic you know town with lots of stuff happening you know lots of stuff you said something to me um well before before we wrapped is there anything else anything else that we we didn't cover that you wanna you wanna hit on there's two there's two things i would hit on you know you talked about innovation one thing one thing that you notice very quickly as a westerner is no one takes credit cards yeah they used to like the last time i went but it's almost a hundred percent uh wechat pay and alipay and if you can't get those to work on your phone you're screwed man you can't pay for anything um what's what's the government's position on crypto i don't know the answer to that question okay i don't but but because they've been using these apps for so long um you've started to see incremental innovation around that so most restaurants you go to not to very high-end ones there's a qr code on your table that qr code not only represents the restaurant but it represents the table and you can order from that you can pay from that like like so if you are done eating and want to pay and leave you just scan and pay and go you walk right out and um you know we we're far away from that in the us that amount of of automation around payment um and it's just interesting and and that goes from you know the high-end hotel and restaurant will take wechat pay and the street vendor will take it right it's it's it's universal so that's one thing the other thing that i would just mention um very recently china announced something called the k visa and one of the um one of the things that's happened recently because of i'd say an increased um agitation between the two countries is there have been a number of very recent policies in america that are impacting skilled immigration especially at the university level and i did hear stories over there of groups of 50 or 100 phd students who had been admitted into a university and we're now being told they can't attend and you and i and everyone have talked about skilled immigration and how that's been kept flat in the u.s um and now you know at least with regard to china we're starting to put up blockers and on top of that you've seen these other charts where like 50 percent of the ai researchers in america are chinese and so that that's something that's super interesting to watch and this k visa thing which they've never done before says if you are studying um technology you know i don't know the exact rules you don't even have to have a job so this isn't like a in the u.s you need a you're welcome to come they're going to give you a visa so china's basically inviting everyone to come to their university systems from around the globe i don't know how successful they'll be i don't know if europeans will go there um but it's an interesting thing to see again it's just a reminder to me like i i continue to think that uh the u.s is in an incredible position on a global basis an incredible position vis-a-vis china but decisions matter and you know we talked about stapling a green card to every you know uh every diploma as uh you know the the president did as part of the the the presidential race um and certainly i think there's ample opportunity uh for upside to accelerate to attract to build in the u.s and i hope that one of the takeaways of this conversation the many conversations we ought to have and it's why i think being overly dogmatic leads us astray is we got to reflect on the things that we can be doing better to run a faster race ourselves right and i've heard you say this before you know the old quote from the godfather never hate your enemy enemies you know it clouds it affects your judgment yep and i think there's a lot of that going on in silicon valley and other places that um you know we're going to be a lot better off if we're very pragmatic about uh there's no slowing down in china they're going to be there in ai they're going to build chips at huawei they're going to build models at deep seek and the the way to beat them is not to you you know try to cut them off at the knees we don't need to make it easy on them but the united states needs to accelerate our race and i think by if we focus too much on how do we slow down china we take the eye off the ball on how to accelerate our own race so it's fun spending one of these just digging deep on a on a particular topic sounds like an incredible trip yeah and i would just echo what you said like like on especially just on learning like my my main point to anyone that's interested in this topic would be just make sure you have the exact right information as you then go to make decisions especially around policy um and you know talk read read what these uh global uh car ceos are telling you they've been over there they're seeing it with their own eyes they they don't they don't have a reason to be as candid as they're being necessarily but they are um and then read dan wang's book i think it's fabulous like tyler kyle said it might be one it might be the best book of the year it's very well written and and a joy to read and i would uh encourage everyone to go pick it up it's called breakneck i think it's out now today now you literally can go on chat gpt and just ask it you know uh what your favorite ceo you know what's jensen wang think about uh the level of competition in china what's tim cook think what's elon musk think um the reality is the people who spend the most time on the ground in china have the most respect for you know the innate uh you know capabilities and ongoing competition that we're going to see with china and you know and and i thought that dan had a really balanced view at the end which is you know we shouldn't go out of our way to make it really easy on china but at the same time we got to engage we got to be you know pragmatic we can't stick our head in the sand and we have to know that we got to reform ourselves we got to run a faster race ourselves bill it's great seeing you i'm glad we're kind of getting back in the swing of things and uh look forward to uh continuing the conversation as a reminder to everybody just our opinions not investment advice</p></div></div></body></html>
