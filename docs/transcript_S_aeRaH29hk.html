Amy, what do you say? - This is Chris's segue to try to get credit for all of the work that he does. Because I would say Chris leads a lot of our digital life and I lead a lot of our physical life.</p><p>And so it kind of breaks down that way. But in all reality, I don't know that we necessarily have conquered this whole, how do we divide household responsibilities? I think there are natural divisions of responsibility that just naturally, I actually very much enjoy doing laundry, it's therapeutic for me.</p><p>You manage a lot of the financial stuff or having to call banks and deal with payment stuff because honestly, it's my nightmare. And I really don't wanna have to touch that. Understanding those things and funneling those responsibilities where maybe one person enjoys it or where doesn't find it to be such a burden makes a lot more sense than trying to equally split 50/50.</p></div></div></body></html>
