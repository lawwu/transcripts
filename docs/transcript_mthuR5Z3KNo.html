The first is anything but Biden. The second is anything but Trump. The third is pro-Biden. The fourth is pro-Trump. And then the fifth is the other. And I think that that entire bucket of anything but Biden just became available.</p><p>And it was a pretty sizable bucket. There's a large number of voters out there that felt pretty strongly that Biden poses such a significant risk for leadership in this country because of the mental issues and the performance issues that we had seen that as much as people didn't love Trump, they were willing to vote for him because he's not Biden.</p><p>Now that camp has an option, and that option is Harris. So some percentage of that camp, and I would say probably a super majority of that camp, is now switching into the Harris bucket. The pro-Trump bucket doesn't move. The pro-Biden bucket probably doesn't move. It sticks with Harris. And the anything but Trump bucket doesn't move.</p><p>It sticks with Harris. The fact that there is probably such a sizable number of voters in the anything but Biden camp is what's probably helping Harris at this point and creates a bit of a handicap for Trump.</p></div></div></body></html>
