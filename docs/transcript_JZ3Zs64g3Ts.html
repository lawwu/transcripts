Can you believe that the man who had more influence on the American car culture, probably even than Henry Ford, himself was always driven. He was a chauffeur. In fact, he was so busy that Carroll talks about him as having two limousines behind each other, and he would have a secretary in one, and he would be dealing with business and writing letters and things like this.</p><p>And then she would have all she could do. They would pull off to the side of the road. She would get out of his car. The car that was following would discharge the secretary in that car. They would switch places, and the fresh secretary would get in the back seat, Moses, and they would continue to work.</p><p>And the first secretary would go to type up whatever she had to do. He worked all the time. He really didn't have much of a private life. There are not many people like Robert Moses.</p></div></div></body></html>
