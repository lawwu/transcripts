Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. Today on the show, philosophical show. Let's begin with a question. Who do you want to remember you when you are dead and gone? And what do you want to be remembered for? Who do you want to remember you when you are dead and gone? And what do you want to be remembered for? If you have a clear answer to those questions, most of your life path will be charted out, and somebody who knows you well will generally be able to predict the choices that you will make in life. If you don't have a clear answer to those questions, you're going to need to spend some time thinking about them. Don't despair. A lot of times those questions take years to come up with, and they crystallize more and more as time goes on. These are not questions that you answer one time in life and things are settled for the rest of your life. No, these are things that you think about continually over the course of your life, and you make adjustments based upon your answers to these questions. In life, you will have to make trade-offs, and good decision-making is going to be driven based upon your being aware of the options that are available to you, and then being aware of the personal philosophy, the personal ideals, the personal goals, the personal values that you bring to a decision so that you can make the best decision for you. In almost any choice, the biggest cost you will face is the opportunity cost. Opportunity cost is the thing that you give up when you make a choice. If you come to a fork in the road and you choose to go left, the biggest cost of your choice of going left is what you're not going to see or do or have by going right. That's your opportunity cost. When you come to that fork in the road and you make your choice, you are giving up everything to the right if you choose to go left. But if you choose to go right, then of course you're giving up everything when you choose to go everything to the left. To make one choice in life means often that you can't make another. For example, if you say yes to taking the job at the local factory, because it's a job that will provide for your needs, it'll give you a secure form of employment, et cetera, you're not going to also be able to be an international journalist. Those jobs are not going to work together. If you take job A at the factory, you're saying no to job B as the international journalist. But on the other hand, if you say yes to working as an international journalist, then you're going to have to say no to other things. For example, if you're taking a job as an international journalist, you're not going to be able to work the land and heal the land that you own and develop your farm and care for your animals. You can't simultaneously be a successful farmer caring for animals and be an international journalist. So you have to choose. And these choices are painful to most of us who are fairly capable. Because if you're anything like me, you look at the factory and you say, man, I can see all the great things about the factory, and I would be a really good factory worker. But then you look at the international journalist job and you say, man, look at that, that would be really, really neat, I'd really like to do that. And then you look at the farming job and you think, I would really like to do that, what a blessing it would be to be able to heal the land and care for the animals and care for the people. It would just be wonderful to do that. But you can't do them all. You have to make a choice. To excel in one area is necessarily going to mean that you're not going to excel equally in every other area. If you're a capable person, you can do a lot, but you can't do it all. You can do well in many things, but you can't do well in all things. So you will have to choose. And with most of these things, there is no objective choice of right or wrong. We could not make an argument that it is better, objectively speaking, as an absolute standard, that it's better to work at the factory, or that it's better to work as the international journalist, or it's better to work as a farmer. Those things are not in the world of right and wrong, absolute standards of truth. Rather, those are subjective things that are based upon your values, your lifestyle, your skills, your goals, et cetera. But you're going to have to choose. And so you should, as Stephen Covey put so famously, you should begin with the end in mind. And a good way to get there is to think about who do you want to remember you, and what do you want to be remembered for? Who do you want to remember you? You will have to choose the people that you are going to spend your life with, and commit to spending time with those people in order for them to remember you. If you choose your family, and you choose to spend time and energy and money on activities with your family, you will have to say no to other people. This is why if you choose to marry, you're automatically going to spend less time with your friends, because you're gonna spend time with your spouse. If you have children, you're going to spend less time with your coworkers, because you're gonna spend more time with your children. So it's a choice. If you choose your family, you'll have to say no to others. If you choose your friends, you will have to say no to others. Or if you choose to spend time with your coworkers, you'll have to say no to your family and friends. If you choose your customers, you'll have to say no to your coworkers. And in order for you to make that choice, you're gonna have to be clear on who you want to remember you, and what you want to be remembered for. I always thought about this when I used to work as a financial advisor. And in the world of financial product sales, you sell an insurance, investments, doing financial planning, there's this fascinating little thing that some people seem to figure out. But your coworkers don't buy from you. And I could never understand why people would spend so much time around the office, spending all kinds of time with people who were never gonna buy anything from them, instead of going out and spending time with customers who were gonna buy from them. And at least how I would prioritize it, I'm gonna spend time with customers who are gonna buy from me. You spend a little bit of time at the office with the coworkers, because of course there's the politics of the office, et cetera. But I'd rather be with either customers or my family and friends rather than with coworkers. Well, maybe today I can, it's funny, I have a lot of friends and it's funny, I have relationships still with my family and friends and my customers, but not many with coworkers. I guess it's kind of normal. That's what I chose. I chose to be remembered by those people. The point is, you can't spend time with everybody all at the same time. So you're going to have to choose. Think about who you want to remember you when you're dead and gone, or when you leave town, or whatever timeframe you can picture. Who do you want to remember you when you graduate from high school? Who do you want to remember you when you graduate from college? Who do you want to remember you when you close down this business and start your next one? And what do you want to be remembered for? You're going to have to be clear on what you want people to say about you when you're gone, because you will have to live that out now. You'll have to live, I hate the word, authentically. You won't fool the people that are closest to you. You cannot. Your wife will know who you are. You cannot fool her. Your children will know who you are. You cannot fool them. Your business partner will know who you are. You can't fool them. You won't fool those people. And so you're going to have to live it out. Now here's what's cool about life, and I'll wrap up with this. In life, there are many things that you can do. You have many options of things that you can choose to do. And you can spend massive amounts of time considering those options. You can take in all kinds of input, of ways that you can improve things, other people's paths, and it's never been easier to hear other people's stories. So don't say yes to one life course too quickly before you've considered the options. But then, if you're actually gonna make a difference, you're actually gonna have to say yes to one course of action. And that's going to come at a cost. You're gonna give up other things. You say yes to marriage, you're going to be saying no to late night sessions with your friends at the beer hall. Say yes to a sales job, you're going to be saying no to spending lots of time in your local office just hanging out, chatting with your coworkers. And every choice, you fill in the examples, I don't need to go on forever. So think carefully, and use the opportunities that you're given to say, to get ideas about how you'd like to be remembered. Who do you want to remember you, and what do you want to remember them before? But don't be scared to commit once you know the direction that you want to go. I don't think I want to belabor the point of this show any more than that. So I'll just simply allow you to fill in more details, but think about those questions. Who do you want to remember you when you're dead and gone, and what do you want to be remembered for? And my hope is that if you'll think about those questions, you'll gain increasing clarity about the answers. Then you'll have a useful tool to bring to the options that life presents to you as you consider those options.
