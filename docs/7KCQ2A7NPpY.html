I just wanted to throw that caveat out there. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">now to your question. Okay. So what do we know? It turns out that we can very comfortably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">speak to several things. One is the role that genes play. So maybe I'll just spend one second</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">on a gene 101 thing for the viewer. We want to differentiate between what are called germline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">mutations and somatic mutations. So your germline and my germline are set. When we were born,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">our germline mutations... Any mutations we have in germline genes are inherited from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">our parents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They're non-negotiable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They're non-negotiable. You got those things. So question one is how much of cancer results</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.060</a></span> | <span class="t">from those types of genetic mutations? And the answer is very little, less than 5%. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">very... You mentioned one a moment ago, BRCA. Okay. So mutations in BRCA are germline mutations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">A woman will get a BRCA mutation from one of her parents. And we will often have a sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.540</a></span> | <span class="t">of that just from the family history. When mom and sister and aunt and grandmother had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">breast cancer, you've got a breast cancer gene. Now it might be BRCA. It might be another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">gene that's not BRCA, but there's no ambiguity. And we test for these genes mostly just for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">insurance purposes, frankly, but there's no ambiguity that that was a germline transmission</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">of a gene that is driving cancer. But 95+% of cancers are not arising from germline mutations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">They are arising from somatic mutations or acquired mutations. So the question then becomes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.860</a></span> | <span class="t">what is driving somatic mutation? And the two clearest indications of drivers of somatic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">mutation are smoking and obesity. Smoking we've talked about. Let's put that aside for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a moment. I'm so surprised about obesity. I don't know why I'm surprised, but I've never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">heard this. I'm probably just naive to the literature. Yeah. So obesity is now the second</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">most prevalent environmental driver of cancer. Now I will argue, and I think I argue this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in the book, hopefully pretty convincingly, I don't think it's obesity per se. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">obesity is just a masquerading proxy. What is obesity? Obesity simply is defined by body</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">mass index. Well, first of all, I don't think I'm obese, but I'm way overweight on BMI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You probably are too. So, you know, let's just ignore that. I'm clinically diagnosable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">as obese. Are you? Oh, no. Well, not clinically. That would be BMI over 30. I don't think you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.300</a></span> | <span class="t">probably there. No, but if I measure my weight by height... Yeah, yeah, yeah. My BMI is probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">27 or 28. Okay. It's been a little while since I've checked. I only know body fat percentages</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and things like that. So basically, like BMI is a far from perfect proxy, but at the population</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">level, it's what we use. I wish we would get off it, by the way. I think it's really crap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it doesn't take into account lean versus non-lean tissue. Yeah. I think we could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">get better data if we looked at waist to height ratio. That's a way better metric. So this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is just a quick test for everybody. I'm going to argue your BMI is less relevant to me than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">your eye color. But if your waist circumference is more than 50% of your height, you should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">be concerned. Okay. Well, then I'm okay. Yeah, you're fine by that metric, right? But that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">important. So if you're six feet tall, your waist better be under 36 inches. And if it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">over, I would argue that's the definition of obesity, not your BMI being over 30. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">back to this issue, because we're using such a crude measurement, it basically is catching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">a whole bunch of stuff. But the question is, what's driving it?

Do not get a CT scan</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KCQ2A7NPpY&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">or any imaging study without asking, how much radiation am I seeing?
