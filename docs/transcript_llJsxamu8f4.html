So I was hanging with J. Cal and we're talking to Beeple. Yep. And for some reason, J. Cal was being nice to me and he said to Beeple, he said, do you know who this guy is? This guy is a legend in Silicon Valley.</p><p>You know, he introduces me. Yeah. And then I said to Jace, I'm like, you know, this is Beeple. And he just sold like $260 million like NFTs. I'm like, this guy's a legend too. And without missing a beat, J. Cal says, well, maybe for the next year. I'm doing all in.</p><p>Let your winners ride. Rain Man, David Sack. I'm doing all in. And it said, we open sourced it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it. Love you, Westgate. Queen of Kinwa. I'm doing all in. Hey, everybody. Welcome to episode 58 of the All In podcast. Yes, the podcast.</p><p>I don't know if you guys have been watching. I'm drinking, boys. I'm drinking. Well, it's Friday. We're filming late on a Friday. You can tell from the backyard behind Shamath that it's the evening. And he's cracked open a little something, something. A little, little, little delishy poops. Oh, Bond.</p><p>2002, St. Eden.

A lot of questions about the All In Summit. I went to see the locations when I was in Miami. We've got the location we want. We're working on dates. And you'll have more information soon about that.</p><p>So welcome back to the program. With us today, as always, is the Sultan of Science, the Queen of Kinwad. moi himself david friedberg the rain men yeah he's definitely back from art basel of course he went to our basel and i don't know if he bought any art but i was on his boat with him uh or his rented boat david sax and i were on a boat and a boat well i mean he hasn't bought one yet but i think he's moving there and then of course the dictator himself chamali polyhapiti here tamale with an obnoxiously expensive sweater tell us about that yes yes everybody wants to know what animal was killed to make that what animal was killed for that horrible ernie sweater this this is a collection oh god of the foreskins of some white tigers i'm out i'm out i mean it is incredibly soft and smooth i literally got a complaint like foreskins are oh god i'm just really going in a bad direction right i've literally got a complaint freebrick and sax are like what are they talking about i literally got a complaint on dm about chamak's conspicuous consumption of his sweaters and they and she was like listen i don't mean to tell you your business but i think chamath is turning off the audience with these letters was it an angry mid-level white it wasn't white but a very extremely successful one i'll leave it at that anyway uh really really they were just concerned every week really really we have to go through chamath's sweater does she pay does she pay attention when i put in 700 million dollars a year into climate change how has she put in that much uh with her shitty sweaters uh okay listen enough give him some more give him some more wine someone text now it's gonna be one of those just checking if we're gonna if we're gonna start moral virtue signaling over here all right well there's a we got a lot to cover i mean this is just absolutely crazy finish a glass of wine real quick and then roll into the show this is this is going well this show is going to go off the rails i've already lost control of the show uh all right we got to start with inflation and the economy uh while sax and i were in uh miami for our basal there was an absolute uh panic going on two three in the morning people checking their robin hood and coinbase accounts to figure out how much they had lost in their crypto holdings but today i lost more in the robin hood stock than i have in the robin hood app that's too soon bruh that's too soon for me i'm about to distribute i'm like do i distribute now or wait that thing has been a stone sinking to the floor of the ocean well i mean it's pretty never to be found no i mean listen it's 17 18 billion dollars a pretty great valuation uh right now i think it's an opportunity for people but i'll leave it at that let's talk about inflation inflation but we're not dispensing stock advice we're not stock advice but i'm not selling any of my shares i'm telling you right now before i distribute my stock and mark my capital gains i'd like to advocate to people like robin chumak i'm going to just ask you don't show up drunk for the next episode oh my lord i can't even get through the first story here okay inflation does this woman even own a cashmere sweater that she has can we get off of who is this person oh please beep that out god almighty all right what a loser stop i'm glad to hear you're doing something with all those foreskins because we don't want them to go to waste what do they do with the foreskins all those circumcisions i would love for you to just drive here and touch the sweater i mean i i can't i'm like this is something to do on a friday night um all right inflation numbers this is important folks uh inflation year over year sorry but excuse me but if you're if you're spending your time working in biotech working in crypto and fighting climate change it's wrong to buy a cashmere sweater like all of a sudden you also have to look like a homeless you know the lumberjack because being ugly is so cool now the idea was do we have to start the show with your fashion you started with that statement by this person who better be good looking or well dressed otherwise they have no right to make this claim all right calm down chamath let's get to the show you insulted his sweater game that's the definition now we know what he's most sensitive honestly you might as well have called me a oh dude you might as well dude dude stop it's just a sweater comment and it's just conspicuous consumption is that what she's really trying to say she's trying to maybe she's trying to call me the people because you brought it up who is it out her i'm not asking let's cancel her we're not getting nobody's getting canceled for pointing out that you're talking about four thousand dollar chinchilla sweaters i've never said how much they cost we beeped it out i've never said how much this one do you want a sweater worth more than four thousand dollars of course i do all right i rest my case i own many but that's what the point guilty on all charges because it's a big u.s consumption uh cpi the past three months today was 6.8 year over year it's the largest increase since 1982.</p><p>we're getting back to the post jimmy carter era uh and when reagan got in there inherited that mess september was 5.4 october 6.2 november 6.8 points up 0.6 or approximately 10 over october 1.4 over september and um here's the chart for those of you watching on the youtube channel this all started in march of 2021 that was the first month where the cpi rose over two percent and who was wrong on inflation well the fed chairman jerome powell called it transitory numerous times over the past two years treasury secretary janet gallon uh in her senate confirmation hearing in december of 2020 yellen said she believed the fed and binding admin could take advantage of interest rates being near zero and spend more on stimulus economist paul krugman thought it was transitory in his op-ed how not to panic about inflation that did not age well quote our business is actually starting to set prices and wages based on the expectation of high future inflation if they aren't and my bet is they won't be then the lesson of 2010 to 2011 will remain don't panic my god he could not have been more wrong who was right on inflation jamie dimon in march i would suspect there is a pretty good chance you're going to see rates going up and people are starting to worry about that the american public specifically gen z has been on top of this issue uh 77 percent of americans were either somewhere or somewhat or very concerned about inflation back in march and gen z uh people aged 18 to 24 had the highest rate of very concerned about inflation at 52 percent larry summers also got this right sax what are your thoughts on inflation which now seems acute and permanent right well it's definitely not transitory um remember when it was at about 5.1 percent over the summer that the administration said no big deal this is transitory don't panic um then it went to six point two now it's six point eight looks like it's headed to seven percent and the real problem here is that these guys the administration have not adjusted course in light of this data what they've tried to do instead is now speciously claim that the same bills that they had written and conceived the build back better bill somehow even though it was conceived at a time uh that was really deflationary that somehow this is going to fight inflation they're essentially repurposing they're just changing the arguments they're using as opposed to changing their their legislative priorities and just today we got a report from cbo saying that this build back better bill wasn't going to cost 2 trillion like the administration said it's going to cost 5 trillion and add 3 trillion to the deficit for 10 years correct over 10 years if those programs are not sunsetted so there's a bunch of budgetary gimmicks that were put in the bill basically a lot of the programs would sunset after one year or three or six years and so that's the only way they've gotten it to this you know 1.9 trillion dollar price tag the reason why that's a gimmick is because once the programs are created there's going to be it will create a special interest or constituency who is now dependent on those programs and no one's ever going to want to cut them milton friedman's milton freeman famously said that there's nothing quite so permanent as a temporary government program so that is the game that progressives are playing is they're going to create the dependent the dependency the constituency who once they receive the program is never going to want to give it up and they're counting on the fact that they're going to be able to cut them and they're going to be able to get the money out of the bank and they're going to be able to get the money out of the bank and they're going to be able to get the money out of the bank and they're going to be able to get the money out of the bank and they're going to be able to get the money out of the bank which means they will cost five trillion and it will add three trillion to the to the debt um to the deficit so you know the problem is it'd be one thing if we were in a deflationary environment if the economy was in the tank but these guys are continuing to pump more and more stimulus into an economy that has enough and really larry summers made this point all the way back in february i think this is worth reading what he said he said there's a chance that macroeconomic stimulus on a scale closer to world war ii level of inflation is going to be a big problem and the global economy is going to be a big problem and the global economy is going to be a big problem and the global economy is going to be a big problem and normal recession levels were set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation he said this in february everyone in the administration dismissed him all the liberal economists that you mentioned basically derided him he turned out to be exactly right and he was just saying this about the the one point the roughly two trillion they passed back in february for of covet stimulus and you know since then they passed 1.2 trillion for infrastructure and now it's this another five trillion for build back better so you know the real problem here is that they are not adjusting course in light of this data that keeps coming out that inflation is a bigger and bigger so what's the right thing to do in your mind sax and then what about you elon said it can this bill we don't need it this is not what biden was elected to do you know he was elected to provide normalcy stop the chaos and he never got a mandate for this kind of you know whatever 10 trillion dollars we've been wanting to do an infrastructure bill bill for a long time but we didn't that was prior to pumping so much stimulus into the system it's just done the infrastructure bill and not the build back better it would have been one thing um but we're this is basically the the third hyper stimulatory bill that that they've sought to pass first they did the covet release bill at a time when really the economy didn't need that stimulus dovetailing this and chamath involved in this is the jobs report uh november non-farm payroll rolls increased only 210 they expected it to be 573 so it's a big miss however kind of a missed bag because there's over 11 million job openings and we're now at 4.2 unemployment rate which is the lowest which is getting towards the pandemic lows and you know this is like before the 2008 financial crisis chamath how do you reconcile inflation along with this crazy bizarre job situation where people will not go back to work people are planning on resigning there continues to be resignations and there's too many job openings and people are raising salaries and still can't hire people well i think we did a pretty good job of unpacking the great resignation i think it was last pod so right remember like yeah there are three structural issues at play in the jobs front one is that you have this really meaningful under immigration that's happened because of trump the second was you've had a big mismatch between the degreed classes in america and the jobs that they can have for what they think they should earn meaning you go to school you get into all this debt you try to become a teacher or something and then you realize you can make more at an amazon warehouse crazy strange and then the fourth is you have all these boomers with an enormous amount of savings 30 40 50 trillion dollars who are pulling forward their retirement and also subsidizing their kids you put it all together there's less of an incentive to be in the job force unless you pay higher wages now so i think that's a really important thing to think about and i think that's a really important thing to think about and i think that's a really important thing to think about let's just put a pin in that for a second i think the thing that sax talked about is really important which is that we have to really figure out whether inflation is transitory or it's persistent and it's here and i just want to bring up i'll nick i'll send you these texts uh these the the twitter links to this but uh bill ackman tweeted out these two things today which is that if you fan of the pod brilliant investor by the way uh great human being brilliant investor two very specific things he actually called out the word consumer price index which is a very important component of the consumer price index and it's really important because it's a very important component of the consumer price index and it's really important because it's a very important component of the consumer price index and it's really important because it's a very important component of the consumer price index and it's really important because it's a very important component of the consumer price index right how much can somebody basically charge rent to other people the way that they calculate that which is 30 percent of the uh 30 of the calculation is they survey a handful of people the problem is you don't need to survey because the actual exact data is available from single-family rentals that report this number so their survey showed basically a much much smaller increase than what the actual increase is and let me just give it so the largest owners of nationwide single-family rentals are reporting a 17 year-over-year rent increase wow the the oer that was calculated quote unquote by survey and the cpi was 3.5 percent if you flow that through it means that core cpi actually went from 4.9 percent today to actually nine percent and the cpi print which was 6.8 percent was actually 10.1 percent so it just goes to show you we have sources of data that the government is not in a position to collect or measure we have horribly inaccurate econometric models that we use you know you know that phrase sort of in out so unfortunately you get very bad garbage you get very bad crappy data and now all of a sudden we're printing numbers we're supposed to make policy against those numbers but the numbers that underlie this decision making is fundamentally flawed and it's flawed in the wrong direction okay let's bring friedberg in freeburg what do you think is happening here vis-a-vis uh also the creation of companies and entrepreneurship because one of the weird things that's occurring is we're starting to hit a record number of llc's s-corp c-corps being created it seems like a lot of people are becoming freelance nation uh hundreds of thousands of new companies during the pandemic were started that is probably one of many places where the water is flowing when you fill my cup and it shall overflow with um i was talking to a guy this week who's just a small eight was not that bad yeah come on yeah put the wine down no no let him drink the wine um and uh fast this guy has a multi-billion dollar consumer credit portfolio in subprime which means you know he's got the a bunch of consumers owe him money that um generally there's going to be a high default rate and his no comment not and um he said that this year the portfolio performed beyond like the one percentile of the model distribution of what they expected to happen they they had the yield on the portfolio be 40 higher than they thought it would be because there's so much liquidity in the hands of individuals and so i think you know um jason while you might make the argument that companies and jobs are being created that is one of many places where like you know you overflow a river and lots of streams start to flow you know we're seeing asset bubbles everywhere in crypto in startups in new startups and new ideas in home prices and everything sneakers now the problem with inflation is um you know it's a uh definition we all use this term and we throw it about but like inflation is really the measure of price going up over a period of time and generally you want to have inflation of some amount that allows you to see economic growth and expansion that allows you to fund the debt that you used to create that growth in the first place and so without infl without some sort of an inflationary pressure which is the output of economic growth you end up you know being unable to meet your debt obligations and then things get really ugly and uh the system as it was constructed because most of these governments and systems like we have today are funded by debt so um you know uh stan druckenmiller gave a good interview in q2 he was kind of on a road show you know um sounding the alarm bells around what was going on he was saying the market is not speaking right now because basically you know the market is not speaking right now because basically the fed kept canceling the market signals uh with their um with their interest rate policy and by canceling those market signals it seemed like we had a free for all at the government level to keep spending and so i i do think that these two are pretty interrelated the fact that we've kept interest rates low have allowed policy makers to say you know what the cost of debt for this government is zero we can do anything we want just like consumers are saying we can do anything we want we can buy anything we want we can spend any way we want and as a result we're kind of seeing this you know inflationary pressure uh persist now the problem is if you then raise rates and you can't borrow that money and suddenly people have to start to pay that debt down with um without economic growth having occurred the business goes the whole system goes bankrupt so the challenge that the fed has is how do we raise rates without triggering an economic recession and if people are now have overspended and are over levered once again and rates go up it's going to get really ugly really fast and so this is a first derivative balancing act so you know if you're going to have a good balance of money you're going to have to be able to keep your money in the bank and then you're going to have to have to have to pay the debt that you owe so that's the first derivative balancing act and yeah there's no simple and easy solution unfortunately meanwhile technology is causing deflationary pressures which is exactly you know maybe what you don't want to see happen when you're trying to realize economic growth um and that's uh yeah the other thing that we talked about is that the fed basically changed the or the government changed the rules on the percentage basically what qualifies a million dollars.</p><p>And if you think about it, most Americans, you know, 80 to 90% of their true underlying wealth is their home, to the extent that they build, you know, positive net worth. And if you all of a sudden, you know, push up the upper bound on what a conforming mortgages to a million, a million dollars, that effectively means it's, it's roughly about 20%.</p><p>That effectively means that you're moving people's net worth up by about four million. That's right. So and so if they take that, and then they take that money out of their home via a HELOC or an equity line of credit, right home equity line of credit. And then you know, to your point, Friedberg, they spend it or they invested or they you know, it could be a real disaster scenario in five or six years.</p><p>No, no, this is more like 1929. Kind of Yeah, by the way, if you go back to the remember when we were in like the depths of the market collapsing and everything when basically the economy shut down with lockdowns on COVID started. And I was speaking to a senior banker at that like that day.</p><p>And he told me, look, it's pretty simple what's going to happen. The Fed's going to drop interest rates to zero and they're going to pump money into the system. Because that's the only way you're going to be able to keep asset prices from collapsing. And we're going to artificially inflate asset prices and we're going to do it for a long time.</p><p>Because then people look at the stock market and they say, Oh my gosh, stocks are going up. Oh my gosh, revenue is going up. Everything gets inflated by pumping money into the system. And the problem is, while there's a, you know, a perceived you keep saying the home price goes up, and I keep saying stocks go up.</p><p>But the purchasing power that arises when the inflation is higher than what those things are going up at indicates economic recession underlying that inflationary bubble. And the circumstance needs to be analyzed, unfortunately, a little bit more deeper than that, which is it's not just about inflation. It's about have we pumped enough money in to trigger economic growth, that we can come to balance where the growth can outpace the inflation, and we're not there.</p><p>Well, superimposed on this, I think about it. Sorry, let me just say, let me just say one simple analogy. Let's say I've got 50 clams. And you know, there's suddenly a bunch of clams come into the clam market. Now I got 100 clams. And if the number of clams has gone up by three x, my purchasing power has actually gone down by a third.</p><p>While it might look like I've now got twice as many clams, I can only buy one third as much as I could buy before, because there's so many more clams floating around. And that's the problem. Clams, you look like clams, clams, clams, so you like I'm just, listen, I did a little bit of math, I've been watching the price to sales ratios of some of the top companies, we can pull this up on the screen.</p><p>And the price to sales of companies, including zoom, obviously was ridiculous. During the pandemic, that was a pandemic stock. So on top of all of this money being printed to the system, you want to be able to get a lot of money out of it. And you know, you're going to have to be able to get a lot of money out of it.</p><p>So you had the participation of a bunch of stonk traders, you know, in that whole movement, buying up meme stocks or others, we had the price sales ratio of zoom, in other words, the value of the enterprise versus their actual sales was at 123. It's now at 14.7. Peloton was another one of those at 23.</p><p>Now down to three x, down 87% Coinbase Square also, it drops off pretty significantly here. But you can also we looked at the peak price to sales and how much larger it is then and so some of these are now off eight x four x and then it drops off to two x one x.</p><p>But it quite a I don't know if you guys are looking at the numbers or if you have any thoughts on this, but we're reap it seems like there was a mispricing of certain equities. And it wasn't a mispricing the Federal Reserve forced a lot of institutional investors to be out of the system.</p><p>And it wasn't a mispricing the Federal Reserve forced a lot of institutional investors to be out of the system. And it wasn't a mispricing the Federal Reserve forced a lot of institutional investors to be out of the system. And it wasn't a mispricing the Federal Reserve forced a lot of institutional investors to be out of the system.</p><p>institutional investors to be out as long dated as possible in buying earnings? You have to remember, it's not just that real rates were effectively zero, but if you wanted to own inflation protected securities, it was actually a negative yield, so we were destroying people's savings. There are a lot of institutions, well not individuals, institutions that must own some of these inflation protected assets so we were already in a negative yield environment.</p><p>What are those folks supposed to do if they have to fund an 8% return a year to pay the pensions of good people, firefighters, teachers, you name it, policemen, etc., right? They were forced to invest in the kinds of funds that would then go out further and further out into the future to buy the promise of future cash flows.</p><p>And when all of a sudden, a whole bunch of other assets that they have, they're going to go out and buy, they're going to go out and buy, they're going to go out and buy, they're going to go out and buy. They're going to go out and buy. They're going to go out and buy.</p><p>They're going to go out and buy. They're going to go out and buy. They're going to go out and buy.
