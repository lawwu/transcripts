So today we're gonna go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">through a hands-on scenario. We're gonna use an example inspired by a real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">customer that we worked with. So we've modified what the actual customer asked us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.940</a></span> | <span class="t">to do, but this is a really interesting case of trying to analyze some images and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">get factual information out of the images and have Claude make a judgment about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what content it finds there. And I actually do not speak the language that this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">content is in, but luckily Christian and Claude both do. So I'm going to pass it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">over to Christian to talk about the scenario and the content. So for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">example that we have here, it's intended, so to set the stage, imagine you're working for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Swedish insurance company and you deal with car insurance claims on a daily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.860</a></span> | <span class="t">manner. And the purpose of this is that you have two pieces of information. We're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.900</a></span> | <span class="t">to these in detail as well but visually you can see on the left hand side we have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">car accident report form and just detailing out what transpired before the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.900</a></span> | <span class="t">accident actually took place. And then finally we have a sort of human drawn sketch of how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.860</a></span> | <span class="t">the accident took place as well. So these two pieces of information is what we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">going to try to pass on to Claude. And to begin with we could just take these two and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">throw them into a console and just see what happens. So if we transition over to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">your console as well we can actually do this in a real manner. And in this case</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.060</a></span> | <span class="t">here you can see we have our shiny beautiful Anthropic console. We're using the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.380</a></span> | <span class="t">new Claude 4 solid model as well. In this case setting temperature zero and having a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">huge max token budget as well just helping us make sure that there's no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.580</a></span> | <span class="t">limitations to what Claude can do. In this case you can see you have a very simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">prompt just setting the stage of what Claude is supposed to do. In this case</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">mentioning that this is intended to review an accident report form and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">eventually also determine what happened in an accident and who's at fault. So you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">see here with this very simple prompt if I just run this. Let me go to preview. We can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.300</a></span> | <span class="t">see here that Claude thinks that this is in relation to skiing accident that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">happened on a street called Schapangatham. It's a very common street in Sweden and in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">many ways you can sort of understand this innocent mistake in the sense that in our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">prompt we actually haven't done anything to set the stage on what is actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">taking place here. So this sort of first guess is not too bad but we still know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a lot of intuition that we can bake into Claude. So we switch back to slides. You can see here that in many ways prompt engineering is a very iterative empirical science.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">In this case here we could almost have a test case where Claude is supposed to make sure it understands it's in a car or vehicular environment, nothing to do with skiing and in that way you iteratively build upon your prompt to make sure it's actually tackling the problem you're intending to solve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And to do so we go through some best practices of how we at Anthropic break this down internally and how we recommend others to do so as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to talk about some best practices for developing a great prompt. First we want to talk a little bit about what a great prompt structure looks like. So you might be familiar with kind of interacting with a chatbot, with Claude, going back and forth, having a more kind of conversational style interaction. When we're working with a task like this, we're probably using the API as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And we kind of want to send one single message to Claude and have it nail the task the first time around without needing to kind of move back and forth. So the kind of structure that we recommend is setting the task description up front. So telling Claude what are you here to do? What's your role? What task are you trying to do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we provide content. So in this case it's the images that Christian was showing, the form and the drawing of the accident and how they occurred. That's our dynamic content. This might also be something you're retrieving from another system depending on what your use case is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to give some detailed instructions to Claude. So almost like a step-by-step list of how we want Claude to go through the task and how we want it to tackle the reasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We may give some examples to Claude. Here's an example of some piece of content you might receive. Here's how you should respond when given that content.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the end, we usually recommend repeating anything that's really important for Claude to understand about this task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Kind of reviewing the information with Claude, emphasizing things that are extra critical, and then telling Claude, okay, go ahead and do your work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's another view. This has a little bit more detail, a little bit more of a breakdown.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're going to walk through each of these 10 points individually and show you how we build this up in the console.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first couple things, Christian's going to talk about the task context and the tone context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Perfect. So yeah, if we begin with the task context, as you realize when I went through a little demo there, we didn't have much elaborating what scenario Claude was actually working within.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And because of that, you can also tell that Claude doesn't necessarily need to guess a lot more on what you actually want from it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So in our case, if we want to break that down, make sure we can give more clear-cut instructions, and also make sure we understand what's the task that we're asking Claude to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Secondly, as well, we also make sure we add a little bit of tone into it all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Key thing here is we want Claude to stay factual and to stay confident.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So if Claude can't understand what it's looking at, we don't want it to guess and just sort of mislead us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to make sure that any assessment, and in our case, we want to make sure that we can understand who's at fault here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to make sure that assessment is as clear and as confident as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If not, we're sort of losing track of what we're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we transition back to the console, we can jump to a V2 that we have here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll just navigate to V2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see here, I'll also just illustrate the data, because we didn't really do that last time around, just to really highlight what we're looking at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we're seeing here, this is the car accident report form, and it's just 17 different checkboxes going through what actually happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see there's a vehicle A and vehicle B, both on the left and right hand

that we want to make sure that Claude can understand this manually generated data to assess what's actually going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is corroborated by, if I navigate back here, to this sketch that we can highlight here as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">In this case, the form is just a different data point for the same scenario.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And in this case here, we want to bake in more information into our version 2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And by doing so, I'm actually elaborating a lot more on what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see here, I'm specifying that this AI system is supposed to help a human's claims adjuster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's reviewing car accident report forms in Swedish as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see here, we're also elaborating that there's a human-drawn sketch of the incident.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And that you should not make an assessment if it's not actually fully confident.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's really key because if we run this, you'll see that, and you can see the same settings as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Claude 4, our new shiny model, zero temperature as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If we run this, we can see here what actually happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">In this case, Claude's able to pick up that now it's related to car accidents, not skiing accidents, which is great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see it's able to pick up that vehicle A was marked on checkbox one, and then vehicle B was on 12.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And if we scroll down though, we can still tell that there's some information missing for Claude to make a fully confident determination of who's at fault here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This is pertaining to your task that you have set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Make sure you don't make any claims that aren't factual, and make sure you only set things when you're in your confidence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a lot of information we're still missing here regarding the form, what the form actually entails, and a lot of information is what we want to bake into this LLM application as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And the best way of doing so is actually adding it to the system prompt, which Hannah will elaborate on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So back in the slides, we have the next item we're going to add to the prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is background detail, data, documents, and images.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And here, as Christian was saying, we actually know a lot about this form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The form is going to be the same every single time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The form will never change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is a really great type of information to provide to Claude, to tell Claude, here's the structure of the form you'll be looking at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We know that will not ever alter between different queries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The way the form is filled out will change, but the form itself is not going to change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is a great type of information to put into the system prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Also a great thing to use prompt caching for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're considering using prompt caching, this will always be the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And what this will help Claude do is spend less time trying to figure out what the form is the first time it sees the form each time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's going to do a better job of reading the form because it already knows what to expect there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So another thing I want to touch on here is how we like to organize information in prompts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So Claude really loves structure, loves organization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why we recommend following kind of a standard structure in your prompts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a couple other tools you can use to help Claude understand the information better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I also just want to mention all of this is in our docs with a lot of really great examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So definitely take pictures, but if you forget to take a picture, don't worry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All of this content is online with lots of examples and definitely encourage you guys to check it out there too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway, so some things you can use delimiters like XML tags.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Also markdown is pretty useful to Claude, but XML tags are nice because you can actually specify what's inside those tags.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can tell Claude, here's user preferences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Now you're going to read some content and these XML tags are letting you know that everything wrapped in those tags is related to the user's preferences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And it helps Claude refer back to that information, maybe at later points in the prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want to show back in the console how we actually do this in this case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And Christian's going to pull up our version 3.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're keeping everything about the other part of the user prompt the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've decided in this case to put this information in the system prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You can try this different ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We're doing it in the system prompt here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're going to tell Claude everything it needs to know about this form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a Swedish car accident form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The form will be in Swedish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It'll have this title.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It'll have two columns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The columns represent different vehicles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll tell Claude about each of the 17 rows and what they mean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You might have noticed when we ran it before Claude was reading individually each of the lines to understand what they are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We can provide all of that information up front.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're also going to give Claude a little bit of information about how this form should be filled out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This is also really useful for Claude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We can tell it things like, you know, humans are filling this form out basically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not going to be perfect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">People might put a circle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">They might scribble.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">They might not put an X in the box.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There could be many types of markings that you need to look for when you're reading this form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We can also give Claude a little bit of information about how to interpret this or what the purpose or meaning of this form is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of this is context that is hopefully really going to help Claude do a better job analyzing the form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we run it, everything else is still the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So we've kept the same user prompt down here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, your scroll is backwards from mine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We have the same user prompt here, still asking Claude to do the same task, same context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll see here that it's spending less time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's kind of narrating to us a little bit less about what the form is because it already knows what that is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not concerned with kind of bringing us that information back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to give us a whole list of what it found to be checked, what the sketch shows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And here Claude is now becoming much more confident with this additional context that we gave to Claude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Claude now feels it's appropriate to say vehicle B was at fault in this case based on this drawing and based on this sketch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So already we're seeing some improvement in the way Claude is analyzing these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we could probably all agree if we looked at the drawing and at the list that vehicle B is at fault.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'd like to see that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to go back to the slides and talk about a couple of other items that we're not really using in this prompt,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">but can be really helpful to building up your prompt and making it work better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one thing that we really highlight is examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think examples or few shot is a mechanism that really is powerful in steering Claude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can imagine this in quite a non trivial way as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So imagine you have scenarios, situations, even in this case, concrete accidents have happened that are tricky for Claude to get right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=810" target="_blank">00:13:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But you with your human intuition and your human label data is able to actually get to the right conclusion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you can bake that information into the system from itself by having clear cut examples of a, the data that it's supposed to look at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can have visual examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You can just base 64 encode an image and have that as part of the data that you're passing along into the examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then on top of that, you can have the sort of depiction or description rather of how to break that down and understand it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This is something we really highlight and emphasize in how you can sort of push the limits of your LLM application is by baking in these examples into system prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And this again is sort of the empirical science of prompt engineering is that you sort of always want to push the limits of your application and get the feedback loop in where it's going wrong and try to add that to the system prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So that next time when an example that sort of mimics that takes place, it's able to actually reference it in an example set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see here as well, this is just a little example of how we do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, really emphasizing the sort of XML structure that we enjoy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It gives a lot of structure to Claude, it's what it's been fine-tuned on as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And it works perfectly well for this example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And in our case, we're not doing this just because it's a simple demo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can realistically imagine if you were building this for an insurance company, you would have tens, maybe even hundreds of examples that are quite difficult, maybe in the gray,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that you'd like to make sure that Claude actually has some basis in to make the verdict next time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Another topic we really want to highlight, which we're not doing in this demo, is conversation history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's in the same vein as examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We use this to make sure that enough context-rich information is at Claude's disposal when Claude's working on your behalf.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">In our case now, this isn't really a user-facing LLM application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's more something happening in the background.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You can imagine for this insurance company, they have this automated system, some data is generated out of this, and then you might have a human in the loop towards the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If you were to build something much more user-facing, where you'd have a long conversation history that would be relevant to bring in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this is a perfect place in the system prompt to include because it enriches the context that Claude works within.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">In our case, we haven't done so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But what we do is, and the next step, is try to make sure we give a concrete reminder of the task at hand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=953" target="_blank">00:15:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So now we're going to build out the final part of this prompt for Claude, and that's coming back to the reminder of what the immediate task is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and giving Claude a reminder about any important guidelines that we want it to follow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Some reasons that we may do this are, A, preventing hallucinations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So we want Claude to not invent details that it's not finding in this prompt, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Or not finding in the data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If Claude can't tell which form is checked, we don't want Claude to take its best guess,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or invent the idea that a box might be checked when it's not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If the sketch is unintelligible, the person did a really bad job drawing this drawing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and even a human would not be able to figure it out, we want Claude to be able to say that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so these are some of the things we'll include in this final reminder and kind of wrap-up step for Claude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Remind it to do things like answer only if it's very confident.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We could even ask it to refer back to what it has seen in the form anytime it's making a factual claim.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So if it wants to say, "Vehicle B turned right," it should say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">"I know this based on the fact that box 2 is clearly checked," or whatever it might be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We can kind of give Claude some guidelines about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we go back to the console, we can see...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the next version of the prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're going to keep everything the same here in the system prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're not changing any of that background context that we gave to Claude about the form,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">about how it's going to fill everything out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We're not changing anything else about the context and the role.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We're just adding this detailed list of tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is how we want Claude to go about analyzing this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And a really key thing that we found here as we were building this demo and when we were working on the customer example is that the order in which Claude analyzes this information is very important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is analogous to the way you might think about doing this if you were a human.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You would probably not look at the drawing first and try to understand what was going on, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's pretty unclear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a bunch of boxes and lines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't really know what that drawing is supposed to mean without any additional context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But if we have the form and we can read the form first and understand that we're talking about a car accident and that we're seeing some checkboxes that indicate what vehicles were doing at certain times, then we know a little bit more about how to understand what might be in the drawing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's the kind of detail that we're going to give Claude here is to say, hey, first, go look at the form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1089" target="_blank">00:18:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Look at it very carefully.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Make sure you can tell what boxes are checked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Make sure you're not missing anything here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Make a list for yourself of what you see in that and then move on to the sketch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So after you've kind of confidently gotten information out of the form and you can say what's factually true, then you can go on and think about what you can gain from that sketch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Keeping in mind your understanding of the accident so far.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So whatever you've learned from the form, you're trying to match that up with the sketch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's how you're going to arrive at your final assessment of the form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1124" target="_blank">00:18:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll run it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And here you can see one behavior that this produced for Claude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1135" target="_blank">00:18:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I told it to very carefully examine the form, it's showing me its work as it does that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1140" target="_blank">00:19:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's telling me each individual box, is the box checked?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it not checked?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is one thing you'll notice as you do prompt engineering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1148" target="_blank">00:19:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">In our previous prompts, we were kind of letting Claude decide how much it wanted to tell us about what it saw on the form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1154" target="_blank">00:19:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Here, because I've told it carefully examine each and every box, it's very carefully examining each and every box.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1160" target="_blank">00:19:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And that might not be what we want in the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's something we might change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1164" target="_blank">00:19:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's also going to give me these other things that I asked for in XML tags.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So a nice analysis of the form, the accident summary so far, it's going to give me a sketch analysis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's going to continue to say that vehicle B appears to be clearly at fault.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1179" target="_blank">00:19:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">In this example, it's a pretty simple example, with more complicated drawings, less clarity in the forms,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this kind of step-by-step thinking for Claude is really impactful in its ability to make a correct assessment here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think we'll go back to the slides.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And Christian's going to talk about a last kind of piece that we might add to this to really make it useful for a real-world task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Indeed. Thank you so much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1205" target="_blank">00:20:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So as Hannah mentioned, we sort of set the stage in this prompt to make sure that Claude's really acting on our behalf in the right manner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And a key step that we also add towards the end of this prompt, what I'm going to show you in a second,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is a simple sort of guidelines or reminder part as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1221" target="_blank">00:20:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So just strengthening and reinforcing exactly what we want to get out of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And one important piece is actually output formatting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1227" target="_blank">00:20:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You can imagine if you're a data engineer working on this LLM application, all this sort of fancy preamble is great,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1233" target="_blank">00:20:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">but at the end of the day you want your piece of information to be stored in, let's say, your SQL database,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">wherever you want to store that data, and the rest of it that is necessary for Claude to sort of give its verdict</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">isn't really that necessary for your application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1247" target="_blank">00:20:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You want the nitty-gritty information for your application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1250" target="_blank">00:20:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we transition back to the console, you'll see here that we just added a simple importance guidelines part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1256" target="_blank">00:20:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, this is just reinforcing the sort of mechanical behavior that we want out of Claude here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1262" target="_blank">00:21:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to make sure that the summary is clear, concise, and accurate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to make sure that nothing is sort of impeding in Claude's assessment apart from the data it's analyzing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1272" target="_blank">00:21:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then finally, when it comes to output formatting, in my case here, I'm just going to ask Claude to wrap its final verdict.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1278" target="_blank">00:21:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">All other stuff I'm actually going to ignore from my application and just look at what it's actually assessing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1283" target="_blank">00:21:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is, I can use this if I want to build some sort of analytics tool afterwards as well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1288" target="_blank">00:21:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or if I just want a clear-cut determination, this is the way I can do so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1293" target="_blank">00:21:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I just run this here, you'll see it's going through the same sort of process that we've seen before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">In this case, it's much more succinct because we've asked it to summarize its findings in a much more straightforward manner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then finally, towards the end, you'll see that it'll wrap my output in these final verdict XML tags.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1310" target="_blank">00:21:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see that during this demo, we've gone from a skiing accident to sort of unconfident, insecure outputs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">from perhaps a car accident in the second version to now a much more strictly formatted, confident output</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1325" target="_blank">00:22:05.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that we can actually build an LLM application around and actually help a real-world car insurance company, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1335" target="_blank">00:22:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Finally, if we transition back to the slides, another key way of shaping Claude's output is actually putting words in Claude's mouth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1346" target="_blank">00:22:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or as we call it, pre-filled responses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1348" target="_blank">00:22:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You can imagine that parsing XML tags is nice and all, but maybe you want a structured JSON output</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to make sure that it's JSON serializable and you can use this in a subsequent call, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1361" target="_blank">00:22:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This is quite simple to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You can just add that Claude needs to begin its output with a certain format.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This could be, for example, a open squarely bracket, for example, or even in this case that we see in front of us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this would be an XML tag for itinerary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1377" target="_blank">00:22:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">In our case, it could also be a final verdict XML tag.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is just a great way of, again, shaping how Claude is supposed to respond without all the preamble if you don't want that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1388" target="_blank">00:23:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">even though that is also key in shaping its output to make sure that Claude is reasoning through the steps that we wanted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So in our case here, we would just wrap it in the final verdict and then parse it afterwards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can use pre-fill as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1401" target="_blank">00:23:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, finally, one step that I would like to highlight here as well is that both Claude 3.7 and especially Claude 4, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is a hybrid reasoning model, meaning that there's extended thinking at your disposal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is something we want to highlight because you can use extended thinking as a crutch for your prompt engineering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, you can enable this to make sure that Claude actually has time to think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It adds this thinking tags and the scratch pad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1427" target="_blank">00:23:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And the beauty of that is that you can actually analyze that transcript to understand how Claude is going about that data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So as we mentioned, we have these check boxes where it goes through step by step of the scenario that transpired for the accident.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1439" target="_blank">00:23:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And in many ways there, you can actually try to help Claude in building this into the system prompt itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1444" target="_blank">00:24:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not only more token efficient, but it's a good way of understanding how these intelligent models that don't have our intuition actually go about the data that we provide them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1452" target="_blank">00:24:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And because of that, it's quite key in actually trying to break down how your system prompt can get a lot better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1457" target="_blank">00:24:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And with that said, I think I'd like to thank all of you for coming today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll be around as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1463" target="_blank">00:24:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you have any questions on prompting, please go ahead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1466" target="_blank">00:24:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I know there's a prompting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1467" target="_blank">00:24:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to learn more about prompting, in an hour we have prompting for agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1471" target="_blank">00:24:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And right now we have an amazing demo of Claude plays Pokemon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1475" target="_blank">00:24:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So don't go anywhere for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1477" target="_blank">00:24:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And as Christian said, we'll be around all day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1479" target="_blank">00:24:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I know we didn't have time for Q&A in this session.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1481" target="_blank">00:24:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But please come find us if you want to chat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1483" target="_blank">00:24:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And thank you guys for coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1484" target="_blank">00:24:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you so much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE&t=1485" target="_blank">00:24:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you so
