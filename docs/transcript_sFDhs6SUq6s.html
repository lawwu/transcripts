It begins on Friday. Related to the theme of the conference, we have questions here that I wanna post to you, Pastor John. And here's the next one. Rather directly put, "Pastor John, "I rely on my pastor to study the Bible "and tell me what it says.</p><p>"I don't feel like I need to read the Bible "because I'm listening to his preaching every week." So what would you say to a person who believes the Sunday sermon is enough Bible intake for their week? (laughing) - Well, I was a pastor and I love it when people listen.</p><p>I love it when people trust their pastors and when they're excited to hear him explain the Bible each week. Amen, amen, that's wonderful. But something's wrong here. I mean, this is serious. Something's wrong here if the word of God is coming with power. Each week, it doesn't just satisfy hunger, it creates hunger.</p><p>I would have felt like a total failure if my people said, "Because of your preaching, "we don't read our Bibles." Like, what? What have I done? I've given you food that is so uninteresting or boring or not having any portent or hope that you don't even pick it up during the week.</p><p>So I'm really puzzled what the mindset of this person is to say, "This sermon is all I need." My question would be this, is it all you want? Why isn't the meal on Sunday wetting your taste for more on Monday? Why not? Seems to me like we have two issues here.</p><p>One is, how much of the Bible do we need? And the other is, how much of the Bible do we want? So let's take the want question. Why would you only want one passage a week from the Bible? Why would you want that one and only passage a week to come through another person?</p><p>To me, that's like saying, "I'm in love. "My sweetheart writes me every day, "and I would like to just read her letters once a week, "and I think I'd like somebody else to read them for me "and give me a digest of what she said." You kidding me? I was in love one time, summer of '67, working as a water safety instructor.</p><p>I smelled the envelopes for five minutes before I opened 'em. I'm not gonna give 'em to anybody else. And so I'm very eager to go off every day with these lavender envelopes and smell the hands of my future wife. To only want to read one love letter a week when she's writing them every day is a sign that something is wrong.</p><p>That's weird. Something's wrong with this person's relationship with God. Paul says that he lives for Jesus, who loved him and gave himself for him. Galatians 2:20, that's true. Jesus loved us so much that he gave his life for us. God loves us so much that he gave his son for us.</p><p>And the Bible is the word of this Jesus who loves us and this Father who loves us about how they relate to us and what they are doing in the world. The whole Bible is an unparalleled love letter to the people of God. So the psalmist says, "How sweet are your words to my taste, "sweeter than honey to my mouth." It just wouldn't make any sense for the psalmist to say, "I get a spoonful of honey on Sunday and that's plenty.</p><p>"Don't want any on Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday "or Thursday or Friday or Saturday." Instead he said, "My delight is in the law of the Lord "and on his law I meditate day and night. "More to be desired are they than gold, "even much fine gold. "If you seek them like silver and search for them "as for hidden treasures, "then you will understand the fear of the Lord "and find the knowledge of God." So I would ask our listener, bless his or her heart, why would you only want one glimpse a week of this beauty?</p><p>One taste a week of this honey? One deposit a week of this silver in your bank? One letter from your lover? What is going on? Wake up, come on, wake up to reality. And then I would shift and ask, what do you need? Is one meal a week all you need?</p><p>Not just what do you want, but what do you need? Jesus said, "Man shall not live by bread alone, "but by every word that comes out of the mouth of God." Every one of them. That's how you live, that's how you live. You need to eat. I think I can say from experience, Tony, and from history, and from the Bible, every Christian needs more Bible, more spiritual food, than one meal a week.</p><p>That doesn't work, physically or spiritually. Temptations are too relentless. Doubt is too frequent. Satan is too active. Tribulations are too heavy. Conflicts are too many. Emotions are too volatile. Perplexities are too difficult. Faith, hope, and love are too threatened to think I can deal with these all week long, simply from one word I got on Sunday.</p><p>I can't do it, and I don't think anybody can. - Amen, thank you, Pastor John. And this Friday begins our 2014 National Conference here in Minneapolis at the Convention Center downtown. It's titled, "Look at the Book, "Reading the Bible for Yourself." It will be our 12th and final national conference, and I know a lot of you will be in town for it.</p><p>You can also tune into the livestream at desiringgod.org/live. That page will have a schedule of events. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you tomorrow. (upbeat music) (upbeat music)</p></div></div></body></html>
