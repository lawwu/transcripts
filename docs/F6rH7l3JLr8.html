When I was 22 years old,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=6" target="_blank">00:00:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I wrote a book called How to Become a Straight-A Student. Here it is for people who are watching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=11" target="_blank">00:00:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">instead of just listening. It was supposed to be a book of no-nonsense advice about how to get good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=18" target="_blank">00:00:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">grades in college. Had a quiet start. This book's actually quietly done well in the background. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=23" target="_blank">00:00:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">think it sold like over 300,000 copies quietly since it came out in 2006. Anyways, this book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=28" target="_blank">00:00:28.740</a></span> | <span class="t">includes a chapter. I'd forgotten this, but I saw the other day, this book includes a chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">where I describe a time management system for students. And the title of that chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is How to Manage Your Time in Five Minutes a Day. This was written back 20 years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So I thought what would be interesting would be for me to go back and reread that chapter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's go back and revisit my ideas from 20 years ago about how to manage your time. Because what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm really curious about is to see where was I on the something that remains true today? And where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">are there, where is there advice from 20 years ago that no longer holds to today? So what works from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">before and what doesn't? I decided not to really revisit this until we were live here on air. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this should be, should be interesting. God knows what's in here, Jesse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm looking forward to it. Yeah. It's going to be a lot of, let me tell you this by 2025,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">our biggest problem is going to be finding air parking for our flying cars. And let me tell you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.820</a></span> | <span class="t">the, I guess I was going to do a whole like Donald Trump thing, but I only know, I guess he was on TV</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">then. I don't know. All right, let's get into it. I'm going to open my book here. Page 19.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Boom. All right. Manage your times in five minutes a day. I'm nervous about this. I haven't read this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in a while. Here's the intro to this, this chapter. Real straight A students, like most reasonable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">students, hate time management. After all, college is supposed to be about intellectual curiosity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">making new friends, becoming obsessed with needlessly complicated drinking games. See,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">that was social proof, Jesse. I was proving to the reader. See, I'm young too. I'm on your page</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.260</a></span> | <span class="t">drinking. An overwhelming interest in time management is best left to harried business executives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh man, that's me now. Or perhaps pre-meds at the same time. However, you can't abandon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">all attempts to keep tabs on your schedule. Uh, and so I'm going to give you some time management,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.820</a></span> | <span class="t">blah, blah, blah. All right. So the setup is like, we're reluctantly going to do time management. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.220</a></span> | <span class="t">don't want to spend too much time thinking about this. So I guess I was really worried about students</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.540</a></span> | <span class="t">saying like, look, man, this is square. Cause that's the way we talked back then, Jesse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.820</a></span> | <span class="t">This is square, man. I'm looking for tubular advice. I don't want to hear about time management.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So I was being careful about it. All right. I lay out now in the chapter,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">here are my criteria for a time management system. Four things. One requires no more than five to 10</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">minutes of effort in a single 24 hour period. Two doesn't force an unchangeable minute by minute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">schedule on your day. That's interesting. That changed. Three helps you remember, plan and complete</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.900</a></span> | <span class="t">important tasks before the very last moment. And four can quickly be restarted after periods of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">neglect. Interesting thing I'm noticing already, Jesse, is like this tone reminds me of early Tim</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Ferris. But this is before, for our work week is before I knew Tim or I'd read his book. So there's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.700</a></span> | <span class="t">it must've been in the air back then. That's sort of really declarative, you know, like ambitious,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">like we're going to do this. We're going to do that. It was a tone that was in the water back then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. What you need. So my system requires a calendar and a list. And I say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the list is some piece of writing material that you can update throughout the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You do have to carry this with you. So make it something simple, like a sheet of paper ripped</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">out of a notebook each morning. So one sheet of paper each day and a more permanent calendar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I said the permanent calendar could be physical or it could be digital. All right, let's get into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.940</a></span> | <span class="t">the details of this system from 20 years ago. Record all of your to-dos and deadlines on your calendar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">This becomes your master schedule. The one place that stores everything you need to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.940</a></span> | <span class="t">The key to our system, however, is that you need to deal with your calendar once every 24 hours. Each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.980</a></span> | <span class="t">morning, you look at it to figure out what you should try to finish that day. Then throughout the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">day, whenever you encounter a new to-do or deadline, simply jot it down on your list. The next morning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">you can transfer this new stuff from your list onto your calendar where it's safe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're back where we started. The whole system can be summarized in three easy steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Jot down new tasks and assignments on your list during the day. Next morning, transfer these new items from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">your list onto your calendar. And three, take a couple of minutes to plan your day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. I then give an example schedule for a day. So I guess you look at your calendar each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">morning. You write down on your sheet of paper your schedule for the day. And so the example I had in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.380</a></span> | <span class="t">here was on one side, a list of appointments. So it was like 10 to 12 econ. 12 to 1 lunch with Rob.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">1 to 145 government reading. 2 to 4 government class. 4 to 530 finish government reading. 530</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to 630 start French essay. And then I had a list called things to remember. And I guess these are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the things that you would jot down during the day. Econ study group moved. French quiz laundry. Start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.900</a></span> | <span class="t">searching summer internship opportunities. So this is interesting, Jesse. It looks like the plan you write down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.500</a></span> | <span class="t">includes basically rudimentary time blocking. Oh, it was. Okay, here we go. So let me look at this a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">closer. So when you're making your plan for the day, I'm jumping ahead here. Look at your calendar entry for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.540</a></span> | <span class="t">current day. It will probably contain a handful of appointments and to-dos. Your goal is to figure out how much of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.860</a></span> | <span class="t">work you can realistically accomplish. You might be tempted to simply copy all of these tasks into your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">today's schedule column and then treat it as a simple to-do list for the day. Don't do this. If you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">avoid getting overwhelmed by your work, you need to be smarter about your time. Here's what you should do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">instead. I bolded this. Try to label each of your to-dos for the day with the specific time during which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.020</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to complete it. Be honest. Don't record that you're going to study for three hours starting at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">three if you know you have a meeting at five and be reasonable about how long things really take. I also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">say you can batch together little errands and you should try to end your day at an appropriate time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The only other thing that's important here is when you update your calendar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.700</a></span> | <span class="t">year each day, you move the stuff that you didn't get done on to other days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me look at this example here. This was the kind of tricky part back then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah. Okay. So not everything gets done. The things that doesn't get done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">have to exist somewhere. And so you move them on to another day when you think you're going to get it done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting. I'm interested by myself. You would appreciate this, Jesse. On one of my sample list</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">here, I have one of the entries from five to seven, quote, get huge. I was being a little bit facetious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">there. I think that means go to the gym. All right. Interesting. So what were the features of this? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.820</a></span> | <span class="t">then what do I think works? And what do I think doesn't work? All right. So back then I was saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just going to summarize all of this, right? All of your tasks need to have a place to live. And back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">then I said, why don't you have them live on your calendar? So obviously like appointments and stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">exist on the specific days and specific times when it happens, but to-dos, you put them on the day you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">think you're going to do them. And then when you get to a current day, you have some stuff on your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">calendar that's timed, like classes and meetings, but you also are going to have this list of things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.940</a></span> | <span class="t">to-dos that happen to be assigned to that day. Then you make roughly a time block plan. That's what I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.900</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about way back then, 20 years ago. Make a plan for your hours of your day, like when you're going to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">what, when your appointments are, see if you can fit the things, the to-dos you had on your list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you fit them in there? You might not fit everything, or you might try to fit everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and not everything gets done. Well, that's fine because what you do is the next day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.860</a></span> | <span class="t">when you create your new plan, you're going to take everything from your list from the day before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that was added new, this capture stuff and put it places on your calendar. This is also when you'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.700</a></span> | <span class="t">take the stuff you didn't get done and make sure those show up for a new day. And maybe you move them to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the current day, or you look into the future to find a day that's less crowded. And so in this plan,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you make a plan, you do your best, you capture stuff on your sheet of paper throughout the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">The next day, the new stuff and the stuff you didn't get done goes back to your calendar,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.580</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you make a new plan for the day ahead. So what I like about this plan,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and then I'll get into what I think is missing. I like the full capture methodology. Now, I can tell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you, I had just read Getting Things Done, David Allen's book, not long before this, that book came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">out, I think in 2004, maybe 2003. I wrote this book largely in 2005. So I had just read that. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">clearly that full capture idea of everything you need to do needs to be written down somewhere. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">nothing that you only are keeping track of in your head. That suffuses this system. And so I like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I still think that's a very good idea. Things you're only keeping track of in your head either</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">cause stress or will be forgotten. The other thing I like about this, and this was obviously a big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">emphasis in my student book, low friction. I was really careful that when you go through your day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you just have like a sheet of paper with you that you're glancing at to be like, what should I do next?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can just jot things down on. It's a paper in your pocket, right? No systems, no logging into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.140</a></span> | <span class="t">anything, no complicated planners back. It would just jot things down on this paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And the only time you really have to grapple with tools beyond that sheet of paper is once every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">morning where you say, okay, let me move things back into my calendar. Let me update my calendar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me make a plan for the day ahead. And that was supposed to take only five minutes. So I like that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">simplicity. I like the planning, the rudimentary planning in this system too, of tasks go on a day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're kind of making a plan like this day looks light. Let me try to do things there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">As opposed to just having a bunch of to-dos and saying, let me try to get some of these done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">today. So it was a much more of an intentional, that's a time block planning philosophy, being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">intentional about your time as opposed to just being reactive or saying, hey, what should I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">what should I work on next?

This plan works really well with something I talked about later in this book</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and I still talk about today, which was put your regular work on your calendar as well. So this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">type of planning for a student works really well when regular work like reading assignments, problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.340</a></span> | <span class="t">sets, labs, stuff you know is due on a regular basis.

And so then that just becomes part of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.140</a></span> | <span class="t">your day.

I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">class at 11. I have studying from 1 to 2.30 on this type of reading. So making that more automatic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">worked really well with this system. Another thing I added later, I think after this book came out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I talked about this on my blog and it's a little known fact that, well, maybe somewhat known, Jesse,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but my blog, Study Hacks, which now became my newsletter as well, originally started in the aftermath</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">of this book as a way to discuss ideas that didn't make it into this book that were about this book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It was the missing chapters for the straight A student book was its original purpose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And I, there I introduced the idea of, you know what, at the beginning of the semester,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">do an extra planning.

So what's missing here? Well, obviously the task volume is very low, which would make sense for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a college student in the early two thousands. If you were, let's say a standard 2026, 2025 knowledge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">worker, your task volume is going to be much, much higher because of tools like email and Slack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.900</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not even dealt with in here. The task are things like do your laundry or pay your cell phone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.380</a></span> | <span class="t">bill. You had a sort of very reasonable amount of tasks. So of course they could live on your calendar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">in the modern professional context.

So to try</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to like assign everything to what day you think you're going to do it, that does not make sense with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.980</a></span> | <span class="t">modern, uh, modern task volumes that you would see with sort of modern jobs. Um, I'm time blocking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">but I'm doing it roughly. Whereas by the time I got 10 years after this book was deep work, I was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.740</a></span> | <span class="t">no, no, just time block specifically, draw the blocks, block out all your working hours.

I think that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">particularly important in college context.

This book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.300</a></span> | <span class="t">it came out in 2006.

So the, the, the, the backstory of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">this book, okay, how to become a straight A student, the, the original draft, and this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">true of this, the final draft, like most of the ideas are mine, right? Because, uh, I did very well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in school after my freshman year. So you're absolutely right about that. So my, my backstory was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I went to Dartmouth college coming out of just like a public school. I wasn't coming out one of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.180</a></span> | <span class="t">elite private schools where they learn how to study. And so my first year was fine, but not great. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I had to pass fail a course or two here to prevent like a bad, like a really bad grade. And okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was rowing crew and I was kind of busy. And then I had this change where I said, I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">get serious about being a student. I got very systematic about my study habits. Why am I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.540</a></span> | <span class="t">studying this way versus that? How am I managing my time and my schedule? And I experimented to figure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">out a set of tools that worked well. And that's when my grades got fantastic and got four O's every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.300</a></span> | <span class="t">quarter, sophomore, junior, and senior, except for my senior spring in which I got one A minus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was in political philosophy, which is why I hate John Locke to this day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Damn you, Locke. I actually, it's true, Jesse, when we were doing the promotion for this book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I went back to Dartmouth and got my transcript. And so we would send it. We would send like copies of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">my transcript to prove that like I actually got all these A's or whatever. Yeah. So yeah. So then I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">figured out, so basically what I figured out is if you're systematic about being a student, by which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">like treat it like a business executive would treat their job, like really caring about how you do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">school wasn't that hard. Like you could do, you could do well without as much time as you thought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically what I did to pitch this book is I had gone to, I was an early inductee in the Phi Beta</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Kappa because I had such a high GPA. So like the top 1% of students, they would induct in the Phi Beta</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Kappa early. So I was, I was very, you know, I was, I think like top five in my class or something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.300</a></span> | <span class="t">right out of a thousand. I had a very high GPA. And that was back when it was harder to do that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">especially in computer science. And so I went to this thing with like the top 30 students GPA wise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.260</a></span> | <span class="t">in the class. And I was like, oh, wow, like I recognize some of these students. They're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">grinds or whatever. And, and I interviewed them a little bit about like, how do you study? I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I interviewed everyone. I sent them an email interview and it was like based off my techniques</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and their techniques that I came up with most of the ideas in the book. But then after I handed in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.840</a></span> | <span class="t">first draft of the manuscript, my editor was like, uh, Ann Campbell is her name that she was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, you know, we need to hear from other students, not just from Dartmouth and from your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1058" target="_blank">00:17:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">class at Dartmouth. So then I went out and surveyed, uh, straight A students from a bunch of schools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I integrated their quotes kind of into the book and I changed some of the, I learned some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.340</a></span> | <span class="t">things from them and I used their ideas, but a lot of the ideas were in place, like before I interviewed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">them. So there's like, you know, there's a lot of quotes from students all thrown through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Those kind of were added later. So that's a little bit peek behind the curtain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.340</a></span> | <span class="t">How did you find the straight A students at other schools?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1081" target="_blank">00:18:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I would look at things like, uh, back then my technique was typically look for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">press releases or articles from schools that would say things like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Phi Beta Kappa class announced. And then what I would do, this was my technique for my first book as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">well, is all you have back then, all you had to do was find any student's email address and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">could learn the naming convention. So you would find anyone's email address at Harvard and you'd be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1109" target="_blank">00:18:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">like, Oh, it's first name dot last name at FAS dot Harvard dot edu, right? Faculty of arts and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.060</a></span> | <span class="t">sciences. And they're like, great. Then I'll see this other student's name on a press release about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1119" target="_blank">00:18:39.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Phi Beta Kappa university or whatever at Harvard. So I'll just do their first name dot last name at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">FAS. I would learn to format and then I would cold email. And that used to work back then. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's how I would do it. And I got the interviews and I threw it in. Uh, so those are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">those, those are those ideas.

So I think that that's cool to see that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1182" target="_blank">00:19:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that system, I guess, more or less holds up. But that's the thing that's missing is back then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I never would have thought about focus. It didn't, we didn't have phones. When I started,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">most people didn't have laptops. There was no way to avoid, this goes back to our recent episodes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1195" target="_blank">00:19:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesse, there was no way to avoid getting lots of cognitive exercise.

You were at a desk at a carrel somewhere. There was nothing there to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1204" target="_blank">00:20:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">distract you.

Like that was it. So like people just got lots of, you just read and thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and studied and you never, you never thought about focus as mattering. 10 years after this book came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.460</a></span> | <span class="t">out, especially 20 years after this book came out, this is like the number one problem faced by students</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1222" target="_blank">00:20:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is that they're so distracted that it's their brain is in a perpetual state of fragmented cognitive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1228" target="_blank">00:20:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">context, which makes it impossible to focus. So like that would have to be chapter. But I talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">focus in here as being important, but I don't see it as something like practice and protect. I just say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1237" target="_blank">00:20:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">if you, if you focus really hard, you get your work done faster, but I would have a much bigger</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1241" target="_blank">00:20:41.460</a></span> | <span class="t">chapter about now if I was ever to, was ever going to rewrite that.

All right. So there we go. That's our deep dive. We got a lot of good questions. So let's do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">those. But first take a brief moment to hear from one of our sponsors. We'll talk about our friends</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1258" target="_blank">00:20:58.900</a></span> | <span class="t">at Cozy Earth. I love my Cozy Earth bamboo sheet set. So we have, my wife and I have two sets of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">these sheets. We've talked about this before. We like them so much. We want to make sure that when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1269" target="_blank">00:21:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">one set of sheet is, uh, is being cleaned, there's another one to be in our bed. Jesse, we just bought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1273" target="_blank">00:21:13.940</a></span> | <span class="t">a third set of Cozy Earth bamboo sheets because here's what we were thinking about. We, uh, sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1278" target="_blank">00:21:18.820</a></span> | <span class="t">have visitors and like we were in, my wife and I went to Philadelphia and her parents watched the kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1287" target="_blank">00:21:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">so they stayed in our room. So we changed the sheets. My wife would like, we need a third set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of sheets so that in that scenario, we can change back to a fresh pair of Cozy Earth sheets. So like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1296" target="_blank">00:21:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">our whole, when you get home.

Sometimes I'll attach the file to the card,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1980" target="_blank">00:33:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">or sometimes I'll just put the title of the email in which that file is attached. And I'll just search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1985" target="_blank">00:33:05.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and find it and print it or load it onto a reader. You know, when the time comes for information,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1990" target="_blank">00:33:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it's more complicated, like you're working on an article or something, and there's going to be a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1994" target="_blank">00:33:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">of different sources, right? Where you don't want three dozen sources attached to a Trello card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=1999" target="_blank">00:33:19.780</a></span> | <span class="t">My general rule is when possible, store research information in the tool you're going to use when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2005" target="_blank">00:33:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you need it. Right? So I write books and articles using Scrivener. I move relevant notes and links and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2013" target="_blank">00:33:33.700</a></span> | <span class="t">resources and files that are relevant to projects, like to a Scrivener project for that article or for that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2019" target="_blank">00:33:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">book chapter. So I just move the information straight in the Scrivener. When I'm writing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2023" target="_blank">00:33:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">an academic article, I use a LaTeX markup language that mathematicians use, right? I'll just move</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2029" target="_blank">00:33:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff I need right into the LaTeX file in which I'm working on. I have an idea. I'll just start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2033" target="_blank">00:33:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">building a LaTeX file, basically like I'm writing a technical article and I'll just add citations and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2037" target="_blank">00:33:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">notes right into that document and it grows and grows. And then eventually what happens is the actual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2042" target="_blank">00:34:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">paper starts getting written at the front of this and the notes get pushed to the back. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2046" target="_blank">00:34:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">eventually they get moved out and you have the final paper. But I just put the information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2049" target="_blank">00:34:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like proofs and links and citations and summaries, like right into the same tool I'm going to use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2054" target="_blank">00:34:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to write the final paper. So for complicated information, if you can keep it close to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2058" target="_blank">00:34:18.820</a></span> | <span class="t">tool you're going to use, I tend to think that's, that's probably best as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2062" target="_blank">00:34:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So with the email search, do you just keep the email on your inbox?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2067" target="_blank">00:34:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, so in Gmail, it archives. So you archive it, it's out of your inbox.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2072" target="_blank">00:34:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you, uh, it's searchable at that point, but Gmail search is not very good. So you really need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2078" target="_blank">00:34:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the, uh, exact subject line. So I'll just copy, like I'll actually copy and paste the subject line</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2083" target="_blank">00:34:43.940</a></span> | <span class="t">and just put it right on the card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2084" target="_blank">00:34:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you ever go into your archive folder and take stuff out or is it just...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2088" target="_blank">00:34:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not a folder. So the Gmail paradigm, it's based on search. So the Gmail paradigm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2093" target="_blank">00:34:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is the archive. It's like the internet or something. You never navigate it. It's just something you search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2098" target="_blank">00:34:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">into. So you just have this, like that was their big idea. Like we're good at search. So when you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2102" target="_blank">00:35:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">done with a thing, don't organize it to a file, a folder, don't have like a hierarchy of different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2107" target="_blank">00:35:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">folders, just archive it. And you can just use our smart search, define what you need later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2112" target="_blank">00:35:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The unstructured storage. The problem is their search is not that smart. Like the whole reason why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2117" target="_blank">00:35:17.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Google searching works well on the web is that it's leveraging all this extra information in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2121" target="_blank">00:35:21.620</a></span> | <span class="t">particular link structure. So it knows like this page is probably what you're looking for because it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2126" target="_blank">00:35:26.440</a></span> | <span class="t">being linked to by a lot of other important pages. You don't have any of that information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2130" target="_blank">00:35:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">when it's just your own emails. So it's really just doing like a much more standard search. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2134" target="_blank">00:35:34.020</a></span> | <span class="t">not very good to be honest. So you really need like a subject line. Like I know exactly what I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2140" target="_blank">00:35:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">looking for. And if you want to pull up again, you always need to have the subject line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2144" target="_blank">00:35:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

Like there's this idea out here that younger people who are coming up with smartphones are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2230" target="_blank">00:37:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">particularly bad at in-person conversation.

When Jesse and I were growing up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2237" target="_blank">00:37:17.700</a></span> | <span class="t">that was a big part of our childhood, right?

And you had to learn how to do that and like how to, how to interact. Interestingly, and maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2253" target="_blank">00:37:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">just because I'm in like elite institutions, I haven't seen this issue. Like my Georgetown students,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2257" target="_blank">00:37:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">they're super articulate, but that might be self-selecting.

It's, you haven't practiced it yet. It's no different than you say, look, I picked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2305" target="_blank">00:38:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">up a banjo the other day.

But if you practice, you'd get better.

Practicing is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2332" target="_blank">00:38:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">ultimately a thing that's going to help best.

So make it very clear what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2377" target="_blank">00:39:37.980</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to talk about. Point. Deliver clearly. Here's my point. So here's the original information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2384" target="_blank">00:39:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm offering. So in this sample, this is where you might say something like, we have too many meetings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2390" target="_blank">00:39:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that could probably be consolidated into fewer. We should think about ways of combining meetings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2395" target="_blank">00:39:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You've set up what you're going to talk about. You've made your point. Then you contrast, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2400" target="_blank">00:40:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the dialectical approach. As opposed to what we have been doing, which is if anyone has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2407" target="_blank">00:40:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">something they want to discuss in a group, they send out a separate invite for it. So you've made</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2411" target="_blank">00:40:11.100</a></span> | <span class="t">your point, what you want to deliver. You contrast it to existing points, and then you give details and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2415" target="_blank">00:40:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">implications. So the way we might do this, for example, would be instead to have a standing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2420" target="_blank">00:40:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">meeting block every afternoon that can be used for multiple purposes. The implications of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2426" target="_blank">00:40:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">details would be some stuff might have to wait or that meeting might get rushed, but I think it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2431" target="_blank">00:40:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">probably worth it. So if you hear someone follow that pattern, you don't recognize that they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2436" target="_blank">00:40:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">following that pattern, but it seems very persuasive. Let me cue you in setup. Let me cue you into what I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2441" target="_blank">00:40:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">want to tell you about. Let me give you very clearly. Here's my point. Let me contrast it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2445" target="_blank">00:40:45.500</a></span> | <span class="t">other ways you might do this to clarify the contours, give you some details and the implications</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2450" target="_blank">00:40:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of it. Report and I'm out. You talk that way in a business setting and they're gonna say, Diana's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2456" target="_blank">00:40:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">sharp, really clear, interesting ideas. They're really on the ball. So there are heuristics like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2461" target="_blank">00:41:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">that you can do, but practice is the best. If you listen to, this is a canard, but it's true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2467" target="_blank">00:41:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">This is like one of these cliches that true. Screenwriters will tell you, like Hollywood</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2470" target="_blank">00:41:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">screenwriters. I know some Hollywood screenwriters. They'll tell you that you want your dialogue to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2476" target="_blank">00:41:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">sound quote unquote natural, right? You don't want people to sound like they're reading a script,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2481" target="_blank">00:41:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">but what'll happen is most screenwriters early on in their career will go through this point where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2486" target="_blank">00:41:26.420</a></span> | <span class="t">they're like, let's just listen to real conversation. I can take notes on real conversation so I can make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2490" target="_blank">00:41:30.300</a></span> | <span class="t">it very natural. And what they realize is real conversation is barely comprehensible. If you just sit and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2496" target="_blank">00:41:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">listen over, listen to people casually talking, and then you transcribe that and try to put it into a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2501" target="_blank">00:41:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">movie, people are going to think that the point was like that character had a traumatic brain injury</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2507" target="_blank">00:41:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">recently. Like this, this is so incoherent. Like what's going on? Because the way most people talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2512" target="_blank">00:41:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">when the stakes are low and it's casual and it's with a friend or whatever, it's weird and back and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2517" target="_blank">00:41:57.100</a></span> | <span class="t">forth and interruptive, very digressive, all sorts of verbal tics and re returns and ums and likes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2523" target="_blank">00:42:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, I don't know, man, what's going on. And it's fine in that informal context, but you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2528" target="_blank">00:42:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not at all the way people actually, it's not formal at all. And so in Hollywood, naturalistic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2534" target="_blank">00:42:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">dialogue writing is its own thing. It sounds naturalistic, but it's actually way more structured</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2540" target="_blank">00:42:20.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and clear and directed than the normal people actually really talk. And it's really in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2544" target="_blank">00:42:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">delivery of the actor that makes it sound naturalistic, which is all to say to practice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2547" target="_blank">00:42:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">this. You have to think I'm having a conversation with someone where I could be super casual and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2552" target="_blank">00:42:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't matter. Let me try to be clear. The other thing people always suggest is Toastmasters. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2557" target="_blank">00:42:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">don't know if these still exist, but yeah, you can also go to a speaking club like Toastmasters where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2561" target="_blank">00:42:41.740</a></span> | <span class="t">you practice getting up and giving speeches, but practice is the key here and have some heuristics</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2565" target="_blank">00:42:45.940</a></span> | <span class="t">like setup, point, contrast, details, implication. It's a cool skill to master because the clearer you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2572" target="_blank">00:42:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">communicate, the smarter people think you are, which is going to be a big boost. All right. What</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2577" target="_blank">00:42:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">do we got next? Next question is from Flying Professor. My life and work are divided between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2582" target="_blank">00:43:02.700</a></span> | <span class="t">two different countries with a seven hour time difference. Google calendar just couldn't handle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2587" target="_blank">00:43:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that. So I've gone back to paper and pencil to calendars. Is this okay? Or have I missed something?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2592" target="_blank">00:43:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's a good question. Quick follow-up on Diana. I was just thinking about this, Jesse,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2595" target="_blank">00:43:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">though. Quick follow-up on Diana. I was a very good speaker as a kid and I got a lot of like unfair</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2600" target="_blank">00:43:20.540</a></span> | <span class="t">advantages out of that. I think because I read a lot. But I remember doing an oration at,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2608" target="_blank">00:43:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">my God, I guess I was at like a VA and I had to give a speech in front of everyone about flag burning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2615" target="_blank">00:43:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and whether there should be a constitutional amendment. And I remember just ad-libbing it. I didn't realize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2619" target="_blank">00:43:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it was supposed to prepare something. Anyways, they selected me. I got to go to Boy State. Have you heard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2623" target="_blank">00:43:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">about Boy State?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2624" target="_blank">00:43:44.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you might've mentioned it before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2626" target="_blank">00:43:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So like that was all oration. So I was considering, I was good at Model U N as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2630" target="_blank">00:43:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would, I would do very little work, but I could speak well. And I think it was largely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2635" target="_blank">00:43:55.860</a></span> | <span class="t">because I read a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2636" target="_blank">00:43:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Mm-hmm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2637" target="_blank">00:43:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">There you go. That's my secret power. All right. Flying Professor, two time zones. Yeah. You need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2641" target="_blank">00:44:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">two calendars. You need two calendars. You can use electronic calendars. You just need two of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2647" target="_blank">00:44:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So you could have an electronic calendar for one time zone and another electronic calendar for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2651" target="_blank">00:44:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">other time zone. The problem is you can't use the same Google account. As far as I know, I think the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2656" target="_blank">00:44:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">time zone is going to be consistent across your various calendars. So you have to create, it's fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2660" target="_blank">00:44:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Just create a different Google account just for this calendar. And then you can share, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2666" target="_blank">00:44:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever you actually don't want to share them. You don't want the one time zone calendar to share</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2670" target="_blank">00:44:30.700</a></span> | <span class="t">onto your current time zone calendar because it's going to be the wrong time zone. Let me think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2677" target="_blank">00:44:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this for a second. So I have one calendar for your time zone here. Have another calendar with another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2681" target="_blank">00:44:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">account for the time zone for the place you go. So those are both now local calendars. So when you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2687" target="_blank">00:44:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">in the one place, you look at the local calendar for that place, correct times. When you're in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2691" target="_blank">00:44:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">place, look at the calendar for that place. You're seeing the correct times for that place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2695" target="_blank">00:44:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">You can then share between these different time zone calendars if you want to, and you'll see where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2701" target="_blank">00:45:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">these things fall on each other's time zone. So seven hours, I'm assuming you're talking like Europe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2706" target="_blank">00:45:06.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and East Coast, let's just say. When you look at your East Coast calendar, you can share your Europe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2711" target="_blank">00:45:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">calendar onto your East Coast calendar, and it will show it like the East Coast times, but you probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2715" target="_blank">00:45:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">don't care about that. But it'll show it like, yeah, this thing's happening at two in the morning or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2718" target="_blank">00:45:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever. But I guess you wouldn't want to share them. Just have two separate calendars. So you can use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2721" target="_blank">00:45:21.900</a></span> | <span class="t">paper calendars, fine. I like electronic calendars because I want to do email reminders. I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2728" target="_blank">00:45:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">add information, like here's the Zoom link for this particular Zoom meeting that's going on my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2733" target="_blank">00:45:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">calendar. I want to move things around easier. I want to do repeats. So I would create two Google</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2736" target="_blank">00:45:36.900</a></span> | <span class="t">calendars if I was you.

That'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2744" target="_blank">00:45:44.580</a></span> | <span class="t">confuse you with the time zones. The time zone issue that's the worst, Jesse, speaking of Europe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2750" target="_blank">00:45:50.500</a></span> | <span class="t">is there's a month.

We do a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2756" target="_blank">00:45:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of book sales there. There's a month in March where we get out of, it's like we, daylight savings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2764" target="_blank">00:46:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">times changes in the US and not there. It's different. And there's a month where, until recently,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2772" target="_blank">00:46:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">no one from the US meeting with someone in the UK would ever be on time. It was just a crapshoot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2776" target="_blank">00:46:16.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything was off by this hour and it was different than it was the month before and it changes to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2780" target="_blank">00:46:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the month after. Now it's better because of calendar invites. So if like my UK publisher sends me a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2789" target="_blank">00:46:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">meeting invite for a phone call, Google fixes the time zone. And so now it's okay. But there's a long</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2797" target="_blank">00:46:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">time where I just assumed I was going to get everything wrong. I think when I was doing UK publicity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2801" target="_blank">00:46:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">even as late as like digital minimalism, it was like, this is, we're going to dismiss things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2805" target="_blank">00:46:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so finally Google calendars has made that possible. Everyone gets that wrong. It becomes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2810" target="_blank">00:46:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like a six hour difference or an eight hour difference temporarily for just one month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2813" target="_blank">00:46:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The worst thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2815" target="_blank">00:46:55.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a couple of follow up questions. What do you do with email reminders?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2820" target="_blank">00:47:00.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I use them for, uh, important appointments and stuff like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2824" target="_blank">00:47:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So you, how does it work? You Google calendar, you can click on event and then you can go to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2829" target="_blank">00:47:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">notifications and you can choose email me about this. And here's how early before the event to email me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2835" target="_blank">00:47:15.780</a></span> | <span class="t">about it. So I often do that for important things. So I'll see it first thing. So I don't always trust</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2840" target="_blank">00:47:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">myself. I'm not like an executive where, you know, my day has been scheduled inside and out. And I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2847" target="_blank">00:47:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">my whole day is run off my calendar. First thing I'm going to do is look at my calendar. I'm not like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2850" target="_blank">00:47:30.900</a></span> | <span class="t">that. Like there might be days where I'm, I think, yeah, I know I have to go in at 11 to teach. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2855" target="_blank">00:47:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">going to try to write this morning. Yeah. And so like, I might not look at my calendar until then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2860" target="_blank">00:47:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but maybe there was something important on there that I forgot about. Like, Oh, I'm supposed to go to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2863" target="_blank">00:47:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">some appointment. So I'll have an email me because I usually will, you know, see my usual email the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2868" target="_blank">00:47:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">day before. So when I check my, you know, shut down my email the day before I see this reminder of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2873" target="_blank">00:47:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">like, Oh yeah, yeah. Tomorrow morning I got an event. Um, mainly it's psychological. It just makes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2878" target="_blank">00:47:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">me worry less about missing something. If I know I'm also going to get an email about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2883" target="_blank">00:48:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I have another follow-up question about the archives. So do you only archive items that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2889" target="_blank">00:48:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have those detailed notes of, or sometimes do you archive things and just knowing that you'll never be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2893" target="_blank">00:48:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">else find them because the search won't be good? That's the Gmail. The Gmail methodology is you never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2897" target="_blank">00:48:17.620</a></span> | <span class="t">delete. You archive. So in theory, their whole thing is storage is cheap and just keep archiving all your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2905" target="_blank">00:48:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">emails. So you never delete in. So you archive all yours? Yeah. But you only search for like a small</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2910" target="_blank">00:48:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">percentage. Yeah. Yeah. That's the Gmail data model is never delete, just archive. Interesting. Yeah. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2918" target="_blank">00:48:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you can't see the archive really. It's just, you can search into it. Um, and then they want you to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2923" target="_blank">00:48:43.860</a></span> | <span class="t">like to use the data. So it's sort of, they, they use the data from your email, but like train things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2928" target="_blank">00:48:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and then target ads to you. It's, it's a whole, Oh, it's a whole world. Surveillance capitalism in its</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2934" target="_blank">00:48:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">best. All right. We're going to do two calls today. Do I have that right? Yeah. I love that. Let's get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2938" target="_blank">00:48:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">some calls in. All right. Let's get our first call. Hi Cal. Uh, it's Jessica. Um, I have a question about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2944" target="_blank">00:49:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">coaching. So I was listening to one of your podcasts and you mentioned that you discussed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2947" target="_blank">00:49:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">something with a coach. Um, I'm a female academic in Europe and there's a lot of coaching programs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2953" target="_blank">00:49:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that are free and offered by the sort of university development service, um, often to women, but also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2959" target="_blank">00:49:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">to sort of junior academics, um, at the university. Um, and I struggle a bit to see which ones are sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2965" target="_blank">00:49:25.220</a></span> | <span class="t">of worthwhile and useful to go to and which ones, um, are not so worthwhile. And I was wondering if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2971" target="_blank">00:49:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">could expand a little bit on how you integrated, um, uh, coaching, I guess, uh, receiving coaching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2976" target="_blank">00:49:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">into sort of, um, building a deep life and, and setting up a schedule, uh, that, that has sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2982" target="_blank">00:49:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">appropriate, uh, blocks of, of deep work. Thank you. Well, that's a good question. I think coaching's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2988" target="_blank">00:49:48.900</a></span> | <span class="t">underrated, you know, in general, I think there should be more coaching. It's part of it is informational.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=2997" target="_blank">00:49:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So you get information you wouldn't otherwise have. A big part of coaching is often backstopping,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3001" target="_blank">00:50:01.900</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Having someone backstop a decision that you're making so that you have some confidence in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3007" target="_blank">00:50:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it. So it's a whole bunch of confidence boosting, right? So, so coaching, I think it's really useful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3011" target="_blank">00:50:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It can mean a lot of different things. If you're an academic, there's a couple of types of coaching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3014" target="_blank">00:50:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that's relevant. The first type is what I might more accurately call mentorship. And this is where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3019" target="_blank">00:50:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">you're receiving advice from someone who is in your field and academic, but it's just more senior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3024" target="_blank">00:50:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're really important. Actually, this might be one of the more important things you can do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3028" target="_blank">00:50:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">especially as a junior academic is go to lunch once a month with a more senior academic in your field and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3034" target="_blank">00:50:34.460</a></span> | <span class="t">just pick their brain about what about this? I'm, I'm worried about this. What do you recommend here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3040" target="_blank">00:50:40.540</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you think is going well or not? There's a lot of nuances in this world as in lots of different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3044" target="_blank">00:50:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge work worlds, lots of nuances that aren't given to you in a manual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3048" target="_blank">00:50:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's left to you to figure it out. And you could be going down a wrong end Georgetown,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3053" target="_blank">00:50:53.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, where I've been my whole academic, my professor career, they formalize this. You would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3058" target="_blank">00:50:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">be assigned as a, as an assistant professor, junior faculty, you'd be assigned or you could choose,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3063" target="_blank">00:51:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but you needed a mentor. And then the university or department would pay for you to go to lunch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3067" target="_blank">00:51:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'd go to the tombs once a month for a while with, with my mentor. Good place, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3073" target="_blank">00:51:13.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I was just there. I love the tombs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3074" target="_blank">00:51:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The tombs is awesome.

But anyways,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3081" target="_blank">00:51:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">we go to the tombs once a month and it's just like whatever was on your mind. And I'd learned a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3086" target="_blank">00:51:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">about navigating academia, but navigating the specific institution and like who's who and who's what and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3091" target="_blank">00:51:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what matters and what doesn't and what you should be worried about. That's very useful. So I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3095" target="_blank">00:51:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">mentorship is very useful and that's different than coaching because it's not someone coming in from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3100" target="_blank">00:51:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">outside of your world.

If you have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3189" target="_blank">00:53:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">babysitter here and you swap.

But having someone who's done a ton of time management, like Laura was like, Hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3210" target="_blank">00:53:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you're missing this opportunity, this option here.

Like all these new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3258" target="_blank">00:54:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">responsibilities and opportunities and options come up.

She focuses on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3263" target="_blank">00:54:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">people. So it's really focused on my writing life, not my professor life. And how do I keep producing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3267" target="_blank">00:54:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">and enjoying what I'm doing?

So anyways, I'm a big fan of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3281" target="_blank">00:54:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">coaching.

If I were to schedule boredom,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3327" target="_blank">00:55:27.740</a></span> | <span class="t">how would that look? Could you elaborate? Do you just sit in a room for 20 minutes or the next time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3334" target="_blank">00:55:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">you're in traffic, you just deal with it?

Thank you. Okay. So embrace boredom. That phrase comes from deep work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3349" target="_blank">00:55:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a chapter in deep work. And I think what's important about it is boredom is not something that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3355" target="_blank">00:55:55.460</a></span> | <span class="t">think has a moral valence. So unlike some commentators, I don't think boredom is somehow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3361" target="_blank">00:56:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">good and non-boredom is bad. And therefore by having more boredom, that somehow like that act</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3367" target="_blank">00:56:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">itself of being bored is virtuous. I see this way more technically. So when I say embrace boredom,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3374" target="_blank">00:56:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">what I'm hoping that you accomplish is that your brain gets used to craving novel stimuli and not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3381" target="_blank">00:56:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">getting novel stimuli in response. So it's really just working on the dopamine mediated short-term reward</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3387" target="_blank">00:56:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">circuits. So if your brain learns every time it feels boredom, it gets a treat from a phone, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3397" target="_blank">00:56:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Something comes out and it gets a novel stimuli.

Why do I worry about that? It's because sometimes you don't want to look at your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3420" target="_blank">00:57:00.740</a></span> | <span class="t">phone when it becomes important that you actually do focus on something like you're working on a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3425" target="_blank">00:57:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">important paper or a breakthrough or a meaningful conversation or trying to figure out something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3428" target="_blank">00:57:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">hard. There's no novel stimuli when you're doing that. But if your brain has learned,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3432" target="_blank">00:57:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I always get a shiny treat when I feel that lack of stimuli that we commonly describe as boredom,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3436" target="_blank">00:57:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you're not gonna be able to focus and you're going to have to look at your phone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3439" target="_blank">00:57:19.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So the way you break that is you make sure that you get consistent practice, feeling boredom and not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3446" target="_blank">00:57:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">getting the reward and things being okay. And then your brain's, the strength of that Pavlovian response</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3451" target="_blank">00:57:31.900</a></span> | <span class="t">weakens. And now when it comes time to do something like deep work on something important, you'll do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3455" target="_blank">00:57:35.220</a></span> | <span class="t">better at it.

Deep work is just training your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3459" target="_blank">00:57:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">brain to be better at deep work down the line. All right, how do you actually do this? There's two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=3464" target="_blank">00:57:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">scales at which you need to embrace boredom.

The system that's winning at the game AlphaGo, like most other game-playing AIs that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4038" target="_blank">01:07:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we see, is using an AI technology called reinforcement learning, whereas the system that is doing really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4044" target="_blank">01:07:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">well on that math test, so these like chat GPT systems, for example, these are large language models that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4050" target="_blank">01:07:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">are more data-trained generative models.

That revolution was the introduction of what are called deep networks, which you can just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4079" target="_blank">01:07:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">think of as a neural network that has a lot of layers, really big neural networks. Up to that point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4085" target="_blank">01:08:05.540</a></span> | <span class="t">AI researchers had not really tried to train big neural networks to do things. Part of the problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4092" target="_blank">01:08:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">was figuring out, okay, how do we train neural networks that have lots of layers, right? You have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4097" target="_blank">01:08:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to kind of propagate through signals back through all the layers to adjust the weights when you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4101" target="_blank">01:08:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">training it.

We got more compute in part because of the rise of graphic processing units, which the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4129" target="_blank">01:08:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">video game industry pioneered to make 3D graphics faster on PlayStations. Turns out those,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4134" target="_blank">01:08:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">those same cards, GPUs are great for training neural networks. So suddenly we got a lot more compute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4139" target="_blank">01:08:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and the internet gave us a lot more data.

This was basically the revolution of modern AI was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4197" target="_blank">01:09:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">let's just try it.

Because it turns out what happened is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4213" target="_blank">01:10:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">if you have enough compute and time to train these things, instead of just memorizing your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4217" target="_blank">01:10:17.460</a></span> | <span class="t">training set, they learned and generalized a lot of interesting information about the context in which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4223" target="_blank">01:10:23.140</a></span> | <span class="t">they were operating.

That was the origin of sort of all of the AI revolutions. But if we look at this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4233" target="_blank">01:10:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">technical sort of phylogenic tree, things began to split. So if we look to the language model split of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4242" target="_blank">01:10:42.760</a></span> | <span class="t">tree that led to things like chat GPT, the way you're training these very large neural networks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4248" target="_blank">01:10:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">for something like a language model is with a lot of data, a lot of data from the real world. So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4255" target="_blank">01:10:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">original models is a lot of text and you're giving it real text from the real world. And you're knocking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4262" target="_blank">01:11:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">out a word from that text and saying, do your best to replace that word with what makes sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4267" target="_blank">01:11:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it does a pretty good job, like produces a word that's pretty close to the actual word that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4272" target="_blank">01:11:12.300</a></span> | <span class="t">was there, you sort of reinforce those weights in the network. And if it does a bad job, like now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4276" target="_blank">01:11:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that's not working too well. And if you do this over enough data, what it does is it learns, it basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4281" target="_blank">01:11:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">estimates the underlying processes that produce those texts. So the underlying grammatical subject</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4287" target="_blank">01:11:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">matter processes we use when we produce text, it began to estimate those in these really large neural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4292" target="_blank">01:11:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">networks. And the larger we made the networks, the more complicated processes it could estimate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4297" target="_blank">01:11:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And now when you ask it to produce text from scratch, it can use, it has an estimate of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4301" target="_blank">01:11:41.060</a></span> | <span class="t">process we use in our head and it can produce really good text.

This was sort of like the big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4327" target="_blank">01:12:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">breakthrough. Those are using reinforcement learning. And the way they work is different. So again, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4333" target="_blank">01:12:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">have a big neural network underneath it. They're using big neural networks. But now what they're doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4338" target="_blank">01:12:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">is they're having that neural network interact with a world. It's not just being given a lot of data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4344" target="_blank">01:12:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Typically, it's going to be an online training. So like if you're training a game to play Atari games,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4349" target="_blank">01:12:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">they were actually giving as input to the neural network, every pixel on the screen of the Atari</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4355" target="_blank">01:12:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">game.

And if it was good, it was like, let's change our weights towards this. And through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4379" target="_blank">01:12:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">these like interactions with a real world, with these reinforcement signals, what the model ends up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6rH7l3JLr8&t=4387" target="_blank">01:13:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">learning is a policy.
