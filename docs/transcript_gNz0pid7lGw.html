It's a different game than the Rockstar, which is a different game than, you know, I have a lot of parents say, "My student's fantastic. "He gets mostly A's and B's." Okay, that's one version of fantastic. Okay, the next version is, "Well, my kid's fantastic.</p><p>"He's gonna be fourth in his class, "or he's gonna be the valedictorian." And then there's the next level of fantastic, which is, "My kid's been taking math "at the local college since fourth grade."

So there's all these different levels of fantastic.</p><p>Depending on where you land, that helps determine where you're going and what makes sense.

Or if you want to be a performing artist and you want to be at NYU's Tisch Performing Arts Center right near Broadway versus, again, And the local community college also has a theater program.</p></div></div></body></html>
