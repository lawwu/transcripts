Hello everybody. Testing one, two. Testing one, two. Oh my god. Here we go. Sup, Kevin. All right. All right. We are live. We're live. Hey to our audience. Live on YouTube. Let me make sure. Turn off some. One moment while I turn off. Somebody's got their sound on.</p><p>Okay. Everybody's got their sound off. And we are live here on the YouTube. Welcome everybody. Am I hearing somebody? No. Yeah, someone has their sound on. Chamath, is that you, Jason? Maybe it's my computer. Hold on. Chamath, you're live. Say hi. Hey, what's up everybody? I am watching you guys here, and then I have it streamed here.</p><p>But I don't see it live. It's not live. It's actually delayed. It's definitely my other computer. It's on a 20 second delay. Yes, we're on a 20 second delay. Oh, it's on a 20 second delay. Is that your decision, Nick, for cancellation purposes? No. You can press the button at any time.</p><p>If you say something that's worth canceling. All right. Let me open the show properly. Here we go. In three, two. All right, everybody. Welcome to the all in live stream, celebrating 500,000 subscribers on the YouTube. Do us a favor. Give us a thumbs up, and go ahead and tweet and share.</p><p>We've got about 250 thumbs up. This is how you break the algorithm. If you give a thumbs up, we're now at 400 thumbs up, 3,000 people watching. We want to get the number of thumbs up to match the number of people watching live. What does that do? It breaks the algorithm, and then it shares the show with everybody.</p><p>Go ahead and tweet it. We have taken questions for the last, I don't know, three days. Producer Nick put the stream up early. With me today, of course, your chairman dictator, Chamath Palihapitiya, and the rain man, yeah, David Sachs. At some point, the queen of quinoa, the prince of panic attacks, the sultan of science will join us.</p><p>For now, we're sitting here in the afterglow of the Trump interview. Where is the quinoa button? Nobody knows. Nobody knows. We've sent a group out for the queen of quinoa, and nobody knows where he is. Did you send somebody to Sweet Greens or the organic vegan aisle at Whole Foods?</p><p>Absolutely. It's starting already, man. You show up late. You're going to get barbecued. All right. Let's kick us off here with a little of the afterglow. Sachs, I understand that you got a phone call this weekend. Fill the audience in. Oh, God, please don't start giving us tips. 100% do not do that.</p><p>I see somebody just gave a $10 tip. Do not give us any tips. Don't do that. What is that? That's real money? Yeah. This is like a thing on YouTube, I guess. Only the people who are subscribers to the channel can be in the chat, but you can also give what's called a super chat.</p><p>Dan, Danthacrypto, gave us a $10 super chat, and then that puts their little logo and their chat up on the top, but I don't think we want you guys to send us money. Please don't do that. Oh, top chat. Oh, plus 11 likes. Wow. Yeah. It's just a way for you to get a little bit more play, but just please don't tip us.</p><p>Stop. Don't. Sachs, fill us in. Oh, looks like Dave has entered. Should we let Dave in or no? He's in. We'll admit him. He's in. Okay. Oh, no. Here we go. Stefano now has given us a $5.99 pound. I guess he's from... Oh my God. Here he is. How are you doing there, buddy?</p><p>We are live on YouTube right now, by the way. We are? Yeah, we are. How do I see what people are saying? Click to go to YouTube. You have to go to YouTube. You have to go to YouTube and click on the link, but then you have to turn off the volume.</p><p>Okay. I see. What's going on? Well, apparently we have 1,600 thumbs up and 4,412 people watching live already. Everybody go ahead and give us a thumbs up. Please do not do... Hank, I just told you guys, do not give us super chats. Hank Lieber just gave us a $20 super chat.</p><p>God damn it. Stop it. Atomics Woosh gave us a $10 super chat. Stop giving super chats. I'm telling you now. No, we're doing that to the Trump campaign. All tips will go to... No. For the Humane Society of the United States. Oh, look at this guy trying to score points.</p><p>How about it goes towards my PC12? How about we do that? Goes to PC12. All right, everybody. Are you reading questions, Jacob? Oh God. Bill just gave us a $99 super chat. Stop giving money to us. Give him a Trump donation link. All right. So I hope this doesn't blow up in your lap, but Sax, give us what happened post the Trump thing.</p><p>You got a special phone call this weekend? Yeah. Yeah. The president called to say that he enjoyed the experience and to thank us. And he even said, "Even thank your co-hosts who aren't fans of mine." He wanted to say hi to you guys too. Oh, okay. Is he talking about me or talking about Freebo?</p><p>Well, I said to him that even... He said the two liberals. Well, I said that even my co-hosts who aren't fans of his had to admit he did a good job. And he said, "Well, tell them I said hi too." Oh, okay. So you're saying that to us with the president.</p><p>Got it. Okay. Thank you. Chamath, why did you say that Trump did do a good job? He and I really like each other. In fact, I think of all of us, he called me last November. That's how this whole thing started, if you remember. No, he called Chamath a friend.</p><p>And well, he said, "One of the other guys is a friend." And then he says, "Say hi to the other two as well." Oh, all right. Well, thank you, President Trump. Look, he liked the experience. And what he told me is that he's heard nothing but positive things. Everyone he runs into or talks to says that they saw him on the pod.</p><p>And I think it's very weighted towards business people. So when he meets with business people, they're all like, "Oh, I just saw you on the All In pod." So he said, "We have a big hit on our hands." He said, "We're like TV stars now." That's incredible. Imagine if we didn't have to push sand uphill with some of these folks.</p><p>Trying to do the obvious things. I mean, it's unbelievable, you guys. Unbelievable. Easy to admit in hindsight, no? Well, let's go around the horn here. We are now a couple of days post the interview. I'm curious, Chamath, with a little bit of time between the interview, I'm sure a ton of feedback, what do you think were the most important moments of that interview for the audience, for Americans, and for the voting public?</p><p>Well, I thought you saw somebody that was, frankly, very presidential. I think he took all questions and internalized what he wanted to say, and gave his version of the facts where we didn't interrupt, we didn't cajole, we didn't pander. We asked the question, and then we stopped, and we allowed the former president and someone running for current president to speak his mind, and put it on the record in a way that people can listen to and go back to.</p><p>I think that that's really the most important thing. The second most important thing is that I really want this platform to become a place that can convene these kinds of thoughtful conversations. It takes a lot of investment, frankly, upfront. I think it takes a lot of effort. I'm just glad that we were able to get it over the finish line.</p><p>I feel like we really accomplished something important, so I feel really good about the whole thing. Bruber, I'm sure you got some good feedback. We've had a little bit of time, and I saw you were reading a lot of the press hits, and we were talking about that on the back channel.</p><p>Coming out of it, what do you think the important moments were, and what do you think the public, what resonated with the public? I don't know. I think people just like a long-form conversation with all these guys from Vivek to Ian Phillips to RFK Jr. to Chris Christie having Trump on.</p><p>I hope Biden will come on. The long-form format, I think, gives everyone a much more authentic and genuine experience with the person that they're thinking about or considering in the voting. All the wrappers around who this person is can be suspended for a minute and maybe just hear a little bit from their mouth directly about the issues and allow all the judgment to happen outside of that context.</p><p>Let them speak, and let's hear the voice of the person that is running. I'd love to do more of that. I think it's super helpful to hear the long-format discussions. I've heard so many people, by the way, reach out to me about Jared Kushner's interview on the show that they were so surprised how different he came across relative to what they've read about him and heard about him.</p><p>He's never done much long-form until the show, and that made a real difference for people. I'm not saying anything positive or negative one way or the other. I just think the format's great. I hope we can do more of it. Then you can judge if you think they're full of shit or you think they're legit.</p><p>Sax, a lot of back and forth and people perhaps saying the Trump administration walked back President Trump's comments on green cards for anybody with a college degree. He said, "You staple it right to degree." There was a comment, I guess, from somebody on the staff, "Hey, but these are going to be super vetted." I guess the cynical folks were saying, "Oh, he walked it all back." I didn't see it as a full walk back.</p><p>I saw it as, "Yeah, probably be thoughtful." We don't want to let somebody hack the education system to get a green card if they're in fact a terrorist or something. What did you think about that exchange? I think that's the one that got covered the most in the media.</p><p>Well, I think that what they were talking about was adding some sort of vetting process because if you allow every single college or university, even second or third rate ones to give unlimited green cards, which is basically citizenship to anybody, they could turn into diploma mills that are used purely to circumvent the normal citizenship rules.</p><p>So I get that concern. There has to be some sort of vetting process. There probably does need to be some sort of limit on the number. There probably does need to be a real skills requirement. There probably does need to be a limit on which kind of institutions have this power because you can't just give the entire immigration system over to our colleges and universities to run.</p><p>Yeah, maybe not University of Phoenix. Yeah. So look, I think there are legitimate concerns about the ways in which a proposal like this could be abused. But does that mean that everything Trump said was invalid? I don't think so. I think that Trump expressed the right sentiments and the right values, which is we want the best and brightest to be able to come over to the United States.</p><p>We want to create the dream team here. We want to have high skill immigrants. I mean, he said all the right things there. And I think it's just a matter of figuring out how do you actually implement that policy. But I think he overall helped himself on that question, especially in the tech community.</p><p>Yeah, that was the most positive feedback I got was, hey, thanks for asking that question and pushing him on it because it matters. And I think there were a couple other questions I thought were really important. You know, one of the one that you asked that turned out to be very important was the one on abortion.</p><p>And he was extremely explicit and clear that he would not support a national abortion ban. Just yesterday, we got our first, the All in Pod became context for our first community note, correcting the vice president and maybe the president too, because Kamala Harris was out on X yesterday claiming that Trump would impose a national abortion ban if he were to win a second term.</p><p>I think it's really clear that he does not support that. And so people were taking that clip from our show and putting it on there. I tweeted that clip. So I think that was very important. I think it's another example of Trump helping himself with that interview. By the way, he could have given the wrong answer too, you know.</p><p>There are people who don't like that answer, but we think it's the right answer. And I think it's the right answer for him electorally, but he gave the right answer. Chances of him coming back, Sax? I think they're pretty good. I'm pretty good. Just one other question I want to point out.</p><p>So I think the other piece of news, and I think it really should have been far bigger news, was when I asked him about Ukraine, and he said that NATO expansion had played a major role in provoking the war. Nigel Farage in the UK, who's running for prime minister on the Reform Party, came out the very next day and said the exact same thing.</p><p>And there was a huge firestorm in the UK press because they're even more belligerent and bellicose over there. I mean, they are like spoiling for a war. And there was an absolute pandemonium in the UK press over Farage saying that. But there's abundant evidence that Farage is correct, and there's abundant evidence that Trump is correct.</p><p>And I think that the two of them saying this now, almost at the same time, I think that Trump saying it first actually helped make it acceptable for Farage to say it. But I think both of them now saying it after a lot of academics have said it, Jeffrey Sachs, John Mearsheimer.</p><p>I think that, just to finish the point, I think that it could now break open this debate over Ukraine and help us to get to a peace solution. All right. I remain undecided. I would like to ask Trump a couple more questions. I felt like the interview flowed really nicely, and I appreciate President Trump coming on.</p><p>I would love to have President Biden come on as well. I don't know if that's going to happen. But let's get to your questions. A couple of housekeeping notes here. We will be having another All In Meetup. You can go to more than 50 meetups that are happening around the world on Thursday, July 11th.</p><p>Go to allinpodcast.co/meetups. Allin podcast.co/meetups to join or host an event. Nick will drop the links in the YouTube chat. And as for the summit, quick housekeeping before we get to your questions. We are holding back a couple of hundred tickets for scholarships. Am I correct, Friedberg? Anything you want to let people know about the summit before we get to questions?</p><p>It's going to be amazing. It's going to be awesome. We have some really great speakers. We want to try and announce everyone together, which we'll do in a couple of weeks. But we did just open up 200 more tickets, which we were holding back. So the first batch all sold out.</p><p>We have 200 left. If you go to allinpodcast.co or allinsummit, I actually don't know. Summit.allinpodcast.co. Summit.allinpodcast.co. You can submit an application. We are going to have- Is the scholarship form up yet or we're going to put that up in a couple of weeks? Okay. So we're going to put that up last minute, I guess.</p><p>All right. Let's get to your questions, everybody. Once again, give a thumbs up for your squad. Hit the subscribe button, share it on your socials, and let's get started. Here's a great question for all the besties. Dave's Dynamite asks, "Who is your dream guest for the show?" Who is your dream guest for the show, Chamath Palihapitiya?</p><p>Dream guest. Dave Chappelle. Oh, nice. Really nice. He would be extraordinary. Sax, your dream guest came on last week, so I'll just ask you, who is your second dream guest to come on the pod? Well, I'd like Biden to come on the pod and submit to the same type of questioning that Trump did.</p><p>Okay. At this moment in time, you say Biden. That was going to be my answer as well. Freeberg, tell us which fictional science fiction character from Dune you would most like to see on the program as your guest. Great question, J. Cal, but my answer is Javier Millet. Oh, great pull.</p><p>Great pull. Why? I think Javier Millet represents the salvation of the West. I think that much of the West is headed in a direction that he's, I think, described well, which he generally calls socialist policies that negatively impact productivity and progress. Argentina learned that lesson hard and over a long period of time, and he has kind of Superman-like gone around the world, flying seven times around the earth in reverse time, and tried to revitalize that country and that economy.</p><p>He's gotten foreign dollars to go back into Argentina. He's run a government surplus. Unemployment is declining. All the benefits of having free markets and having capitalism drive progress for everyone seems to be playing out in a very short period of time in Argentina. I think that he kind of represents the next phase of what could be a nasty decade or two ahead.</p><p>You know, now that I think about it that we're talking about world leaders, MBS, Xi Jinping, should be incredible guests as well, huh, Chamath? Yeah. I think there's a decent chance we'll get at least one of them. All right. There you have it, folks. All right. Minesh Deva asks us, "How do you view AI and how it will influence your kids' education?" Saks, I know you're super involved in this, so what are your thoughts?</p><p>You have three kids, by the way. Well, I think the way that AI is going to influence education is that you could create highly customized AI tutors. And so I think the revolution could be that every kid can now receive, again, specialized, bespoke, custom education as opposed to being on an assembly line.</p><p>I mean, the way that we make education today is the same way that we make, you know, Fords or McDonald's hamburgers, right? It's a big assembly line where you create a large batch and you just move it forward. And some people need to go at a different pace. Some people need to go slower.</p><p>Some people need to go faster. Some people need to be on a completely different type of conveyor belt. And you don't get any of that right now. And with AI, you have the ability to cost-effectively deliver, again, a highly customized education experience for every child. So I think that's where it's going, but it's going to take several years to play out.</p><p>Yeah. And this is referred to in the industry as adaptive learning, if you want to go take a look at that. Chamath, your thoughts on AI and our kids' future? I'll expand the question a bit, not just education, but how will it impact our children's career choices and lives generally?</p><p>Wow. I mean, I think that the nature of work is going to change really profoundly. And I think that right now we have not equipped people to take advantage of it. So the things that are known knowns, to use the Donald Rumsfeld quote, will be automated away. Unknown knowns will also be automated away, because that's just about computational horsepower.</p><p>So any job that you did that's formulaic will get replaced probably by a robot. And any job where you're making guesses, but the answer can be inferred or known, that job will go away as well. So what's left over? I think it's judgment, where you have to express some error rate.</p><p>And that's acceptable, because the job requires you to judge something, and people like that. Now the question is, how do you train kids to have judgment? And this is where I think we have really let kids down. Where does judgment come from? It comes from experience. Where does experience comes from?</p><p>It only comes from failure. Where does failure come from? It comes from a culture that celebrates resilience and says, go take these risks, go try some stuff. It's actually really good that it didn't work. Let's talk about why. Instead, if you live in a world that's all about coddling folks and microaggressions and window dressing, the kid won't be resilient.</p><p>The kids don't take risks. And then there's just a parade of terribles that leave these people inexperienced and without judgment. And then I think the computers just run over these folks. I have been giving this a lot of thought as well. And I have been having my daughters go to the store on their own with money to buy stuff and doing all this kind of resilient, adventurous activities with them, having them take risks, do dangerous things, or what maybe helicopter parents would think are dangerous things.</p><p>Because all that's going to be left, if you can get the answer to any question, if everybody's a good painter, writer, photographer, designer, coder, what's left? Taking risks, to your point, Shamath, and having grit, and maybe being a great communicator and a great leader. Freeberg, are you thinking about this at all, AI's impact and how it's impacting how you parent your children?</p><p>I think it's just finding leverage. The transitions that are possible with every technology frontier in human history have been ones of leverage where the human role can scale up. And does it really matter if you know how to do good handwriting when everyone's typing? Does it really matter if you know how to type if everyone's dictating?</p><p>And what can you really do that differentiates you at that new up level? And I think that's really important to think about. I think a lot of people transition from a world of labor to design, like you become architects and what the implications of that and how to be successful in that environment is how I would think about re-education and how I would think about motivating success.</p><p>Fantastic. Okay. Ted Zhang asks, "Been watching the podcast for years now. As a 23-year-old out of college, what are your pieces of advice for getting into bigger rooms with more intelligent, smarter, well-connected, and able individual sacks?" You were part of the PayPal mafia. You got yourself in the room, part of the Stanford community as well.</p><p>What's your best advice here for Ted who's looking to get into the room where it happens? You're on mute, Sax. It's year four of post-pandemic, kids still on mute. Okay. I think I would just generalize the advice a little bit more and just say that the advantage that a young person has is that you have the ability to be obsessed in a way that when you get older, it's harder to be.</p><p>That as you get older, you get more responsibilities, you have family, you want more breadth in your career. I think when you're young, you have the ability just to focus on a particular area, be really obsessed with it. It's a magical thing. It's a superpower that younger people have that it gets hard to maintain that level of focus as you get older.</p><p>I would lean into that. I would say find something that you're excited enough about to be obsessed with. That's my generic career advice. Chamath, you came out of nowhere to find yourself in the room where it happens at AOL, room where it happens in Ventureland and at Facebook. You've done it a couple of times.</p><p>How does Ted get into the room where it happens? Well, I think Ted needs to embrace the idea that his life is going to be made of chapters. I think that some chapters will work, some chapters won't work. Some chapters will work incredibly well. Some chapters will be benign in his life.</p><p>You have to just take a shot as best as you can when the shot presents itself. The reason why I say this is that if you view your life as a series of chapters, the real problem is going to be everybody else because they're going to want to define you by one chapter.</p><p>That's because it allows them to compartmentalize their shitty life. You have to be very careful in not allowing the expectations of other people to drag you down. You should live eight or nine careers. You should try seven or eight or 10 or 15 different things in your life. I've had many chapters from cashier at Burger King to entrepreneur to executive to rank and file worker to investor, all of it.</p><p>Not one is more important than the other. The only people that will try to make you feel good or bad about any one chapter are the ones that are just completely impotent and on the sidelines and they can't get out of their own way. Just view your life as a series of chapters and just try your best.</p><p>Don't be afraid to take risk. You're saying also don't over-index on other people's opinion. I think that's something you and I have talked about. You fell victim to that maybe a little bit in your career, you said? Well, I just think people will try to pull you in a cul-de-sac because they themselves are frozen.</p><p>All right, Friedberg. Ignore the haters. Focus on your craft and your skills. Friedberg, I know that you've been torn, 1989 era, reputation era, lover era. What's your favorite Taylor Swift era at this point? I know you've gone back and forth. What? I'm talking with you. I'm telling you the Taylor Swift era is as if you would know- I don't know.</p><p>Well, what is Taylor Swift's era? I don't know this stuff. Reputation era. People are just obsessed with Taylor Swift. It's crazy how much people are obsessed with Taylor Swift. Did you guys see that Travis Kelsey went on stage and Wembley with her? I did see that. I hope he didn't try to sing.</p><p>No, but he did dance and it was pretty good, I thought. That's got to be a lot of pressure to go there in front of 100,000 people and not totally be two left feet. He did a good job, I thought. No, but any advice? If you saw what he was wearing at the Super Bowl, you know that he doesn't mind making a fool of himself.</p><p>She's a star. She's such a star. I would like to go to the Aeros store just to soak it in, right? Just to check it out. Same. I wouldn't mind going to it either. There's a 50/50 chance I go to it in Milan. Oh, let me know the date.</p><p>Doesn't she perform for like three or four hours? I mean, these things are- That's the thing, it's the Aeros store. It's a whole thing. That is a long performance. And I guess people don't get sick of it. What's the total revenue on this thing? I would get sick of four hours.</p><p>It's like two billion, three billion, right? It's like an insane haul. And she owns all the equity? It's like a good quarter. Multiple of them. Okay, it's a good quarter. InVideo went up that much since we started the live stream. It's a good quarter. It's a good quarter. All right, your donations as you know today, if you do a super chat, all those donations go to the Haktua Fund to help her find a new job.</p><p>Thank you to everybody donating. Is it true the Haktua lady got, or the girl got fired? The woman? I don't know. This is just a rumor, but I mean, it's kind of taken over everything for the last 72 hours. Is it true that- No, I saw something. I don't know if it's true or not, but I saw online that apparently she was a preschool teacher and they didn't like- I mean, I thought she was funny.</p><p>Of course, it's hysterical. Of course. Hilarious. She's super funny. What is the big deal? Why are people so like uptight? I don't know. Apparently some people think she might be a bad influence on their preschool age kids. I don't buy it. Oh my God. No, I don't buy it.</p><p>She's an adult. It's an adult kind of goofy thing. Stop with this pandering. Look at this- Okay, so here's the deal. My wife was really upset because I made it sound like I wasn't happy with these two dogs. Here they are when they showed up off the street. I rescued these.</p><p>What do you think? My IQ rating is going up. In Italian, they're called Bastardini. Yeah, this is a Bastardini. This is a little Italian Bastardini. No, that's a Bastardino. Two of them are Bastardini. Oh, is that Bastardino Carpaccio? Is that what you had the other day? The Bastardino? The Bastardino.</p><p>Thank you. So wrong. All right, let's keep going here. Oh, is there any more of this or no? Next question. All right. Oh, I'll just give that person, Ted, to Sax's point about getting focused on your career. When you do find the one thing you love, building your social media around that, your entire online identity, whether you have a podcast yourself, or you make TikTok videos, or your socials, blogs, Substack, Beehive, whatever your jam is, just really get focused on one thing that you can excel in.</p><p>I've given this advice multiple times, and doing spec work and showing that you're doing work in the world independent of getting paid is a very powerful, very powerful tool. We've seen that over and over again with the all-in creators, so don't be afraid to just do work online and share it with the world around your passion.</p><p>Okay, let's take another question from the audience here. We got the 26-year-old. Nick, you are also pulling in questions. Producer Nick is pulling in questions from the audience in real time, correct? Yes. Yes, Nick. Okay. Let's see. This is Dominic McDermott. "What experience and habit systems from your childhood contributed to making you the skilled individuals you are today?" Sax, anything from the rough and tumble childhood you had in the South of America?</p><p>He's not from the South. He is from the South. I grew up in Memphis. That's not true. Yeah, I grew up in Tennessee. Oh, that's right. I mean, well, we moved there when I was five years old. I mean, I was originally from South Africa, and then my family moved to Tennessee when I was five.</p><p>As I look back, I read a lot when I was a kid, and I didn't really think of myself as an outlier in that department when I was younger, but now I realize that I clearly was, and by today's standards, it would be a huge outlier. Kids today, you just can't get them to read.</p><p>There's just too many entertainment options or too addicted to screens. It's actually kind of depressing. I read a lot when I was a kid. Define a lot, a book a month, a book a week? Well, it's more like if I got interested in something, I would go down the rabbit hole and just kind of read about it until I completely exhausted that.</p><p>I remember, I think in like 10th or 11th grade, I learned about Darwin, and I had never been exposed to that before. And so I ended up reading, the teacher recommended Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Dawkins as other authors that I might want to read if I was interested in the subject matter.</p><p>I ended up reading every single book by Richard Dawkins, every single book by Stephen Jay Gould, not one of them, like all of them. And at the time, this is what I was interested in, so that's why I read it. But looking back, that was clearly an outlier behavior.</p><p>Must have been tough for you when Tucker told you that all that Darwin stuff was actually not true. It must have been tough. It must have been heartbreaking, in fact. Chamath, anything from your childhood on the rough and tumble streets in Canada that put a little fire in your belly today?</p><p>Yeah, I mean, the Venn diagram is growing up on welfare and getting beat mercilessly by my dad. It turned out to be incredible, incredibly valuable. Okay, there you have it, folks. If you can get your parent to beat you, beat your ass, you will be successful. Well, no, and be on welfare.</p><p>I think those two- And be on welfare, yeah. Freeberg, you led a charmed Nepo baby life. Tell us, how did that inform all this great success you've had? Pass. You pass? He does not want to talk about his childhood. You did that three hours this week in therapy. Why do a fourth here?</p><p>I left home early. I was 15 years old when I moved out of my home and went to college. I was on the road, so I was eager to move on. Okay, so the trauma is real. We'll leave it at that. You know what I learned? I've learned you've got to run in a pack and your safety in numbers when you grow up in Brooklyn.</p><p>I have no fear of getting in any kind of an altercation or fight. I do think like I did learn to have a thick skin and be tough growing up in a bar in Brooklyn. I'll leave it at that. All right, let's take another question here. Let's see. You guys see all these comments coming in?</p><p>I mean, I can't follow it. They're too fast. And please, stop giving us superchats. There's like live trolling. Yeah, live shout outs. It's super interesting. Stop giving superchats. Stop giving money to us. How much money have we collected so far? I can't even keep track of it. It's just there's like a hundred people have given any amount of money.</p><p>Where does that money go, J. Cal? How are you going to grift that? I'm trying to figure that out. I'm trying to figure out how to get that money into my- Nick, how do you make sure J. Cal can't get his rubby paws on that money? Nick, can you see how much money it's been total so far?</p><p>Not yet. I think I can afterwards. I just want to know, is it like half an arm of the sweater? Is it like most of the sweater? Is it all the sweater? I just want to get a sense of it. Yeah, I think it's like the zipper area. That's the zipper.</p><p>Okay. I think we're about a quarter way through it, but I see a couple of hundies in here. Some people gave Brandon gave a 50, Bill gave a 99. I mean, people are giving hundies and stuff like that. It's just absurd, but- Well, for a thousand dollars, you can buy the sweater.</p><p>All right. Here we go. Wait, you want to prioritize superchat questions? I mean the zipper. I mean the zipper. Sorry, not the sweater. Yeah, sure. Yeah, absolutely. We're going to give all this money- Yeah, get the superchat, guys, to say something. What is a superchat? What is a superchat?</p><p>Anybody who gives money will do their question. Okay. I got a superchat question. $1. Frank Jimenez just gave a dollar trying to sneak in. You can't sneak into the Velvet Rope for a dollar, bro. $1. $20 from Alex Thomas. No, he gave a dollar. I just gave the woman at Balthazar a $1 tip for a table.</p><p>It's not how it works, kid. That's not going to get you a table. David Sachs, this question is for you. Oh, here we go. $20 from Alex Thomas. How is the all in tequila business coming along? And will you allow your fans and community to invest? Wait. Hold on.</p><p>Wait. I think that we should answer this on behalf of Sachs, because Sachs has been doing this. And every now and then, it's like an Easter egg. He texts into the group chat an update. I am not a tequila drinker, but I will say it looks totally fucking amazing.</p><p>I can't wait. And I don't drink tequila, and I cannot wait. That's what I'll say. All I'll say is, I saw the bottle- It's really incredible. I mean, what you have done is really incredible. I saw the bottle and the packaging, and my pee pee got hard. I'm just leaving it at that.</p><p>It's incredible. I mean, where are you in this whole thing? It's going to make more money than anything else we're going to do ever. Is it manufacturable, Sachs? That design? Are you going to be like, "Hey, don't reveal too much." Yes, it's good. It's good. It's good. It's happening.</p><p>It's happening. Everything's on track. It's one of the most beautiful designs I've ever seen. We're hopefully going to unveil it at the All In Summit. If you're at the Summit, you'll be able to pre-order it. I don't know exactly when it'll ship. Give them the taste of the hierarchy.</p><p>There's a super limited bottle. It tastes better than what is the thing that you said that's really, really good? Well, we're taste testing against Class Visual Ultra, which is $3,000 a bottle or whatever. And it's better than that? Yeah. That's the goal. Yeah. I am so excited about Sachs's- Sachs, you just drink, you sip tequila with like an ice cube in it.</p><p>Is that how you do it? Yeah. But you would never use this tequila to make like a margarita, right? No, no, never. This is too much. Margarita is too much. You'd want to use like a Blanco or something and a margarita. A margarita. This is extra on Yeho. So this has been aged in a barrel for five years.</p><p>How's the $3,000 tequila? I'm blending it up with some sugar water. Yeah, you just want to drink it over ice. I mean, some people will drink it neat, but that's way too hot in my opinion. That's tough. But you want to water down a little bit with some ice.</p><p>Open it up. That's the right way to drink it. Yeah. Open it up a little bit. That's how Sachs and I, when we would hang at the battery, we'd do that. I like Sachs's move. Sachs came in into the whole mashugana of this enterprise. And he said, "I'll do the tequila.</p><p>Give me a quarter million dollars in this LLC and everybody shut the fuck up. And I'll be back in six months." And you know what? Everybody shut the fuck up and he brought it. He brought the heat. I am so excited for this. You want another super chat question?</p><p>Yeah, sure. $50 from Eric. Okay. What is one thing that makes each of you most optimistic? Can we allow, sorry, can we allow anybody that's given beyond a certain, like the 50 bucks, give them a chance to pre-order a bottle? I think that's kind of nice. How many of those guys are there?</p><p>No, like- That's tough to track. That's tough to track. It's tough to track. Why, Nick, can you tell who's given at least 50 bucks or more? If they've done that, which we don't want them to do, let them at least pre-order a bottle with it. Now people are going to do it.</p><p>Now people are going to do it. Yes, if you donate $50, we'll get your name and you'll get to pre-order a bottle. Someone sent $100 and said, "This is for the zipper." Oh, okay. We have a very wealthy audience listening right now. This is pretty crazy. Anyway, $50 from Eric.</p><p>What is one thing that makes each of you most optimistic? Nick, get his name so that we can give him a chance to- Eric Somerville. Okay. What is one thing that makes each of you most optimistic and motivated about the rest of 2024 and 2025? Well, I'll tell you something.</p><p>I have my advisory board meeting for my legacy venture funds, and I was going to write this up. It's hard actually to post a PDF in an ex post. You can do it in Substack a lot easier, but this was the first quarter since Q1 of '22 where I have not had a meaningful drawdown in my portfolio.</p><p>So I kind of think things have bottomed. So before I was more optimistic at the beginning of January, not knowing where valuations would be, because a lot of these valuations in all these private companies are not obviously set by us. They're set by third-party firms pricing new rounds or valuation firms that comp it to the public markets, which are still depressed.</p><p>Saks tweeted about this today about, I think, GitLab, which is like a nutty valuation. But despite all of that, that portfolio, that section of social capital has stabilized. And that was really heartening for me to see that. So I'm actually just excited that we're beginning the process of rebounding, which if you think there's going to be a bunch of cuts in the back half of this year and into next year, these next 18 months are going to be okay for the private markets.</p><p>We tend to price those things forward by that amount, if not more. So I think that valuations are in a decent place, at least looking at the numbers. Saks, anything you're looking forward to back half of the year? Well, I think daddy's coming home to the White House. That's got me excited.</p><p>But on a personal level, I guess I'm excited about working on Glue. So that's a lot of fun right now. So we did a limited release behind a waitlist, and we're onboarding, I don't know, about 40 companies a week now. And then as we do that, we discover more needs and issues.</p><p>We knock off those feature requests, and then we take the next 40. And so we're just doing this systematically until we can go GA, general availability, where there'll be no waitlist, everyone can just sign up. And we're kind of racing towards that date over the next two to three months.</p><p>I think that's exciting for me. Freeberg, anything that you're looking forward to? I'm looking forward to the election being over so we can stop talking about politics, number one. Number two is I'm building a business at O'Halo. I am very excited every day with the progress we make. We are building incredible products.</p><p>We are signing deals with customers and partners. Every milestone is exciting when you're building something new and novel. And seeing it work in the market, it's pretty awesome. So that to me is just like, you know, and there's such a long runway ahead. And there's all these great problems to solve.</p><p>So I love it. It's great. Fantastic. Yeah, I echo Freeberg. It'll be great for the election to get resolved. I am super excited about, hmm, am I super excited about back after the year? I'm excited for ski season again. And I am super excited about some of the companies we're investing in.</p><p>Chamath, to your point, I think the bottoming out has occurred and we're starting to see a lot of secondary offers come in for shares in some of our Fund 1, 2, and 3 companies, which are Fund 1 and 2 companies. Those are the ones that have more time to bake.</p><p>So that is actually, I think, a sign. I don't know if you're starting to see that. Now, some of them are lowball offers where people are offering half off the peak valuation, but it's an offer nonetheless. And there was no bid for, what, 18 months on any of these companies or with the exception of maybe SpaceX and Stripe.</p><p>So yeah, it feels like it's bottoming out. Well, I don't know. I mean, so I think there's a huge gap right now between public and private valuations. So I retweeted Jason Lemkin this morning, which Chamath referred to, who pointed at GitLab's numbers. I mean, this is a company that's got $700 million of ARR.</p><p>It's public. It's valued at about $6.9 billion, so 10 times ARR. Scoring 30% year over year, which means it's going to add over $200 million of ARR over the next year. It's got 130% net dollar retention. So basically, all of its existing customers are expanding about 30% every year, which is amazing.</p><p>Expand that, show more, just for the rest of the stats. If you click show more, you can see the rest of Jason Lemkin's tweet. Oh, there it is on the side. Yeah, anyway, it's actually profitable. It's generating 20% free cash margins. And again, this is only worth 10 times ARR.</p><p>And then if you look at private markets, the last two companies that I talked to, which are exciting companies, they're at 10 million of ARR, and they want billion dollar valuations. 100 times. Yeah. And I don't know if they're going to get that. Like, it may land at $800 or $900 million, but still, they want 80, 90, 100 times ARR valuations.</p><p>Now, they're growing a lot faster than 30% year over year, but are they really going to be growing faster than 30% when they're at $700 million of scale, or even $100 million of scale? Pretty hard to do. It's very hard to do. So there's still a very big gap between public and private valuations.</p><p>Or the question is, which of these would you rather invest in? I mean, a company that's totally de-risked, it's already public, it's fully liquid, and it's growing very nicely. It's weathered the storm. I don't know. I mean, buying a basket of pretty fast-growing SaaS companies at 10 times ARR seems like a fairly attractive strategy to me right now.</p><p>We just had our first private equity firm come into one of our companies. Actually, it's happened twice now in the last year. Private equity kind of crossover funds, asking to buy a percentage of a company and kind of take it over. So I think that's a sign, perhaps, of a healthy market where you have many options of what to do with your funds.</p><p>And some venture funds are choosing to maybe buy out companies and act more like private equity because they see maybe a better opportunity. But there's a lot of venture money out there still, huh, Zach? So that's pushing the bid up. People are looking to find that 10 million, 20 million ARR company and place a bet.</p><p>There's just too many funds. Let's take another question, Nick, from the audience. And what's the record right now in terms of donations? Because this is all going to go to charity, folks. Dead serious. We'll figure out the charity later. I think 200. There are some coming in in different kinds of currencies that I have to convert manually.</p><p>But right now for USD, I see 200. From Rahil, he said, "I don't want a zipper. I'm about to deal sleds. Respectfully, how much for the Laura Piana chamath?" $200. No, this is a sweater that I got from the team at Louis Vuitton because they asked me to wear it.</p><p>I don't know. It's probably a couple thousand bucks. OK. Here's a question from Aditya, $50. "At the level of money and power you all have as a group, how do you think about your legacies, if at all?" I don't. And I think that that is a really, really terrible way to live your life.</p><p>There have been in humanity about 100 billion people that have ever lived. And if you took a sampling of a random thousand people and said, "Who do you remember from history?" the overlap of the same five or 10 people would be almost universal, which is to say that 100 billion minus five people are not going to be remembered.</p><p>And so this goal of trying to be remembered, I'm not sure accomplishes much. I think what's important is just to make sure that you don't have a lot of regrets and that when you have the chance to try something fun or try something memorable or challenging because you thought you would get something out of it, you did it, as opposed to, "How will people judge me for this and how will I be written?" I just think it's a legacy.</p><p>Forget it, man. Your great grandkids won't know you. There's a decent chance your grandkids may not even know you. You got to live to be happy today. That's my personal view. I just think this whole legacy thing is nuts. All right. 8,000 people are watching live. 2,800, thumbs up.</p><p>Give us a thumbs up right now. Let's get those thumbs ups to 4,000 and let's break the algorithm. Freebird, are you thinking about your legacy much these days? No. Sax, any thoughts on legacy? No. I mean, honestly, it's not... I agree with Jamath. It seems like it's not something you should be preoccupied with too much.</p><p>Yeah. I mean, look, you want your kids to be happy. You want to have success in business. There it is. And then it's done. You're done and then you die. So legacy, who cares about legacy? What does that mean? Other people's judgment of you, like some article or book or your Wikipedia link?</p><p>Who cares? Yeah. I mean, I get it as a young person. Maybe you'd think you might project into older people. Like they're thinking about their legacy. I think about having great experiences and optimizing great experiences with my family, my friends, and then business partners who I kind of optimize for family and friends.</p><p>And I had two great experiences this past week. I went to Disney on Saturday with our friend Jason Chang and went to Club 33, which was like a wonderful, fun experience to go in that private club. And then I pinched myself because I could afford to have a VIP tour guide.</p><p>I don't know if you've ever done that, guys, where you just get taken around the park and you jump on the rides. And man, that was a lifetime experience. I've been to Disney once. I stayed at the California Lodge. Nice. I think it must have been what hell looks like.</p><p>And I've never been back since. Did you have the VIP tour or not? Sure. I had everything. And I thought it was just the most horrendous, horrible experience ever. My kids loved it. We did so many rides and it's so much fun. But maybe they're of the age. All right.</p><p>Another question from our amazing audience, your donations. Anybody who donates here is going to have their donation given to charity. $50 from Tommy Gufano. Oh, Tom, Big Tommy? Yeah, Big Tom. Do you see an opportunity for the intersection of blockchains and AI? I also want a pre-order for Tequila, please.</p><p>Smiley face. Crypto is a disaster. Next question. I think that if you take... Forget the currencies for a second, but what is a blockchain? It's an incredibly accurate, highly distributed state machine. That could be valuable if you wanted to do highly distributed inference. So if these AI applications get to scale, I think one of the most important problems is around business risk and continuity.</p><p>Because if all those models run on AWS and somehow you can take down AWS, now all of a sudden your app isn't available. That's a problem for companies. It's also a problem for countries that may want to use these clouds. So then all of a sudden you say, "Well, I need to have it distributed." Well, then if you can only distribute it across three hyperscalers, that's not really a lot of risk management.</p><p>So then you go to a place which is like it needs to be highly distributed. But if you run inference in a highly distributed compute environment, then all of a sudden you need to have an extremely accurate state machine that can then thread all these things back together. So that's the intersection of AI and crypto.</p><p>That's probably the most logical, but there hasn't been any real attempts to figure that out yet. But if there was such a project that did that, now then it creates a bunch of other issues around like NVIDIA lock-in and stuff, which you also can't support. You'd need to be able to extract it so it could run on CPUs in a really powerful way or other custom silicon.</p><p>But that would be my answer to that. Well, one of the problems that crypto solves with respect to AI is helping you know what's authentic or real versus what's fake. Because with AI, you're not going to know what's real anymore. I mean, AI can create a perfect forgery of everything, or we'll soon be at that point.</p><p>So crypto will be helpful in that regard. I think crypto will be the way that AIs pay each other. Clearly, they're going to pay each other in some sort of analog way. Balaji has some really interesting thoughts about this. I'd refer you to some of his tweets about it.</p><p>Yeah, I'm just hoping we see a great regulatory environment for these crypto projects in the coming years. That might be one of Trump's most brilliant maneuvers in this past election cycle is to pick up the mantle of regulation. My gosh, Nick, how many bottles of tequila have we just pre-sold here?</p><p>This is incredible. Quite a few. Well, what's the demand? How many do people want? There's like tens of bottles. You've sold tens of bottles. You've sold almost two dozen. Well, I mean, I'm sorry to tell people this, but it's going to be very limited. I think we're only going to produce about 1,000 cases, which is 6,000 bottles.</p><p>8,000 tops, I would say, because there's only so much five-year-old juice that we can get for the drink, because normally tequila aren't aged. Well, these folks are taking the time to show up, and they're donating. But we're going to get first shot attendees at the Olin Summit. So we're going to unveil it.</p><p>And the people that just donated $100. And the people who just donated $50 or more, I guess. All right. Give us another question, Nick. Let's keep this train moving here. We've got time for maybe two more questions here. Okay. This question is from- Two more questions on the live stream.</p><p>Do I pay on chowdery? What is one book you would recommend that transformed how you think $100? I'm going to search for meaning, Victor Frank. Liars, Poker, Michael Lewis. "Transformed how I think." That's a tough one. I don't know. I may have to come back on that one. Somebody in the chat mentioned Ayn Rand.</p><p>I did like Atlas Shrugged, but I don't know if it transformed my thinking. The concept's a bad writer. Good concepts, but not a great writer. The prose is so brutal. The prose is brutal. I totally agree with you. I mean, make it a short story. Freeberg, you got a book that transformed your life?</p><p>I put it in the Summit gift bag, I think, last year. Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind by Suzuki, which is basically a compilation of the Dharma lectures by the founder of the SF Zen Buddhism Institute. All the lectures are all about sitting Zen, like Buddhist meditation, sitting Zen meditation, but the thinking is so broadly applicable around how the human brain has a tendency to always seek things, this continuing drive of desire.</p><p>And if you can let go of that drive of desire, much of your perception of reality changes. And the second is dualistic thinking, where you think about everything as one or the other. Everything in the universe, everything that we think about is in or out, this or good or bad.</p><p>And I think, for me, changing one's point of view on those two aspects of how the human brain kind of natively associates the universe within which we live can have a huge impact in decisions and emotion and so on in life. So it's a very important book for me.</p><p>And you can read it a million times and always get something new out of it. It's just a copy of his lectures. All right. Give us another question, Nick. We have a new high donation. Rapid fire. Oh. Mark Hossler, $200. Oh, okay. On Rogan's podcast, Neil deGrasse Tyson made predictions for 2050.</p><p>Examples, the human space program will fully transition to a space industry supported not by tax dollars, but by tourism. We develop a perfect antiviral serum and cure cancer. Do you have any predictions for 2050 plus tequila? Donations for 2050? Well, we'll definitely have- Predictions for 2050. Yeah. Artificial superintelligence will be here long before that.</p><p>And then the problems and the questions it answers are going to be mind-blowing. We might figure out the origins of the universe by that time. We might figure out consciousness. I mean, there are questions that humans have a really hard time with. So I would say artificial superintelligence. Anybody else have a prediction for 2050?</p><p>That's like a 25-year prediction window. Yeah. Nobody has any predictions? The guy just spent 200 bucks. Nobody could give him a prediction for 2050. There's a prediction. Your $200 would have been worth 18 million if you put it in the S&P. When you get out that far, you're basically just talking about science fiction, right?</p><p>I mean- Well, I mean, if we went back to 2000, Sax, if you said we'd have flying cars in 2000, you would be right. I mean, Archer and Joby are running sorties right now. Yeah, but that's not what people meant when they said that. There's like prototypes, but this hasn't transformed society.</p><p>They said we'd have self-driving cars and Waymo just opened up. We should have companion robots by 2050. Well, say Marchmont. Like a robot that works around the house that does kind of the 80% of the human toil. I actually think that that could be really- Like the Hawk 2A robot?</p><p>You think we'll have a Hawk 2A robot? No, I mean more like the- The Hawk 2A 2000? The Hawk 2A 2000. I mean more like it does the gardening, it does the dishes, it does the vacuum cleaning. It does the Hawk 2A. It does the Hawk 2A. That's like a really- Freedberg just ran.</p><p>Freedberg ran for it. He can't even be on air for this. That's a huge unlock for humans. My dogs want it to go out. There are two key technologies that I think are long range that I've talked a lot about. We had a conversation last year on the summit about fusion, fusion-generated power, which that's kind of a timeframe where we should be kind of, if it works right at production scale, seeing production steady state output.</p><p>And the other one is aging reversal, which there's a tremendous amount of research. And we will be talking about at the All In Summit this year. We're going to have an amazing conversation about the research that's gone on in reversing aging, which I think we've talked about in the past is fundamentally driven.</p><p>It looks like from epigenetic errors in cells, so not DNA errors like was originally theorized, but like the molecules that sit on top of the DNA that turn genes on and off in a cell. And when that becomes unbalanced, the cells start to dysfunction, organs dysfunction. And that is the fundamental driver of aging.</p><p>And there's now a set of systems and molecules that we can apply to cells to reverse that and actually reset the molecules that sit on the DNA. So these cells start to become young again. And there are many billions of dollars that have gone into this research. And what I've heard in non-public discussions is that this is like looking like it could be very real.</p><p>That would be really amazing. So I imagine taking a fap fap to the e-drug. Yeah, that's in our window. One of the things that I'll also just say on this is like, I think that there's this intersection between AI and biology that unlocks like a really like incredible paradigm for how humans can create things and make things on earth where you could say, I want a molecule or protein that will go in and find this specific cancer cell for me.</p><p>And then you can actually render that protein, apply it to a patient, and it can immediately wipe out that particular target where the AI resolves to the molecule that's needed or the genetic structure that's needed to make, let's say, a plant that can grow on Mars. I want to make a plant that can grow on Mars.</p><p>The AI renders the genome of that plant. You produce it, you ship it to Mars, and you start growing plants in the really weird environment on Mars' surface. So I think that by 2050, we have these kind of intersections that enable some of that stuff that could be really powerful.</p><p>Hey, give us that McHale question if you can. That came in for a Hyundai. That's a good one. I don't see it. I just had a $200 question for you, though. Oh, give us a $200 question. McHale. Why are we getting paid money? I don't know. How does this get turned on?</p><p>It's just like a feature of YouTube? Yeah, you can do two things in YouTube. You can do a super chat where you give money, and your chat gets highlighted in the top of the chat. And then there's memberships. So we could, for the next one, turn on memberships, and people will pay $1 a month, $10 a month to be a member.</p><p>It's kind of fun. It gives you extra features. All right, I got McHale's. Oh, OK, good. $100 from McHale. I am reading the comments. That's why I'm laughing. What are some of the ethical dilemmas that you faced in your careers, and how have you overcome them? What about some ethical dilemmas you've seen from the startups you've invested in?</p><p>Yeah, I've had maybe two of these situations happen where people were, let's say, I'll just make this a composite, but over 400 investments we've done. We had maybe two instances where people were doing things that would be illegal, and we had to, in both cases, I had to sit with the founders and said, listen, I can't be on the board of this company if you're going to do this kind of things.</p><p>And in both cases, I gave them the option to return our money at par, last valuation. And yeah, I resigned from the board and took our money back. So it does happen sometimes. You got to be very careful because somebody does something where they're not upfront or completely honest, and they sell shares in a company.</p><p>It's called securities fraud. You got to be really vigilant, especially if you found out about it and you're on the board. Somebody asked whether Chamath Hawke-- how do you pronounce this? You say Hawke Tua. I think it's Tua. Hawke Tua, your wine. Chamath has Hawke Tua'd some of my wine right on the damn floor.</p><p>He did Hawke Tua it on the floor. I saw it. If he doesn't think the wine that's been served is good enough, he'll just dump it on the floor. He took the glass and he poured it out on the floor. It was a nice aged burgundy, too, if I remember.</p><p>He Hawke Tua'd it all over a marble floor. It was, I mean, it was the height of-- Chamath's not drinking this shit. Wow. There's actually a question about wine, Chamath, if you want to answer it. Oh, here we go. John Knab asked, and this was a pre-submitted one, "I'd like to know what Old World and New World wines are each of the besties favorites?" And then someone else asked-- Great question.</p><p>--how do you know what a good glass of wine is or something like that? Well, I really think it comes down to your own personal taste. I'll give you a perfect example of this. Merlot gets shat upon a lot by fake intellectuals, but it creates some of the best wines possible.</p><p>As an example, if you were to go into the Old World, there's something you've probably heard of called Chateau Petrus. Those are like $5,000 to $50,000 a bottle. But if you go to Italian old-growth Merlot, like Masetto, that's probably $1,000 to $3,000. So enormously, just an order of magnitude cheaper.</p><p>It is incredible and pound-for-pound better than Petrus. And if you put it against it in a blind tasting, you would prefer the Masetto over the Petrus. So what does that mean? I think it means that there is a lot of people that just want to demonstrate they can spend money, and that's dumb, because I think there's just a lot of incredible wine that's much cheaper than that.</p><p>Then if you go all the way down to like, for example, last summer, I gave these guys some of this, but the most incredible white burgundy I have found is Charles Boussaint, 80 euros a bottle, absolutely incredible. And it'll run circles around PYCM. It's running circles around Cocherie, which are thousands of dollars.</p><p>So you've got to try a lot, and you've got to go with what tastes good, and who cares what anybody thinks. By the way, I will pre-reveal this, but I think I told you guys this, but Joshua and I, so my sommelier and I, we just filed for a liquor license.</p><p>And so when we get it, we will be allowed to buy wine wholesale. So we are becoming, because honestly, the wine is so marked up, and we were like, well, if we have our own liquor license, and we have our own storefront, so we got a storefront, we're going to be able to buy and import wine at wholesale prices.</p><p>What's your favorite five to $10 bottle, Chema? Like when you go to Trader Joe's, what do you really like to explore? I don't go to Trader Joe's, it's off-brand. I will never go there. No, but you have a, you already gave an 80 euro bottle, so it's a $100 bottle.</p><p>$80, $80 bottle. If you can find a Charles Busson white burgundy, it's incredible. Pallmeyer is a couple of hundred bucks, consistently excellent. In the new world, if you want to spend sort of between that five to 700, Colgan, Sloan, Bond, all these are great. A hundred acres. A hundred acres.</p><p>A hundred acres is probably my favorite Napa wine, and it's not the most expensive. I mean, it's expensive to be sure, but it's not in the Harlan category or Screaming Eagle. Harlan's like a thousand bucks a bottle. Harlan's a thousand. And Screaming Eagle's like two or three thousand. A hundred acres is like 500 bucks, and I think it's the best Napa wine.</p><p>And I like Colgan too, and I like Schrader as well. Schrader's excellent. There's a guy named Sean Thackeray, who is a kind of, he passed away two years ago, I think. Yeah, two years ago. He made all these crazy California wines, but he had this theory that it wasn't just about representing the varietal or representing the particular plot, but he really wanted to create a story and an essence from the wine.</p><p>So every year he had a name for the wine. He created a custom label, and he would go out and he would source grapes, and he would test all the grapes at different vineyards, and he would do like a multivariety wine that he never kind of disclosed what was in it.</p><p>And then he threw out all of the conventional French wisdom on how do you make good wine, and he went back to all of these Franciscan monks books, and he translated them from Latin on how do you make amazing wine, where you like leave the grapes out and let them breathe for a night and live under the moon after you harvest them.</p><p>The Franciscans have crushed two things. One is champagne, and if you have a chance to buy an incredibly good bottle of single grape Chardonnay champagne, I encourage you all to do it. Don't buy the blends, but if you can get a bottle of Salon or get a bottle of Paul Roger, these things are unbelievable, and the Franciscans used to make it.</p><p>They're incredible. The methods are different, because in the French model, it's like you crush as soon as you harvest, and like a lot of the guys you mentioned earlier, they'll harvest at three in the morning so that the berries are still cool when they start to crush. But Thackeray and the Franciscans, they'll like let the grapes start to ferment naturally out in the sun in the open before they even do the crush.</p><p>The Italians do the same thing. Also, that's how Amarone is made. So anyway, check out Sean Thackeray. His label is called Pleiades, and he's got like an amazing kind of... Every year is different. Every vintage is different. It's really incredible. But he's gone now, so all this stuff you got to buy.</p><p>Okay. Well, I'll second just on the cheaper, say under $100 bottles of wine, I'll second Jamal's recommendation on white burgundies. These are white wines that come from the burgundy region. If you drink Napa whites, they have a lot of sugar in them, so they either taste like honey or sometimes butterscotch.</p><p>Those are the two dominant flavors. When you start drinking white burgundies, they're just much more complex. They have a lot of minerality from that region. Great nose. Yeah, they're less sweet. They're more floral sometimes and just very crisp and refreshing, especially for the summer. That's a really nice bottle of wine to drink on a hot summer day.</p><p>All right. That's what we need. Let's do this next live chat when we're outdoors and we could have some just nice chilled wine. This has been an amazing hour plus with the besties for hitting 500,000 subs. We're now at 528,000 subs. 8,000 of you live, thousands of thumbs up, thousands of dollars in donations to charity.</p><p>We'll pick a charity. I think that's going to be the J-Cal PC24 Pilatus Fund. We will see you all when we hit... When are we going to do the next one of these? 750, 600,000? We're going to do a million subscriber party in Vegas. That's the party in... We're going to do a million subscriber party in Vegas.</p><p>But between then and now, maybe we'll announce another one of these. Maybe every 100,000 or 200,000 subs, we'll do this again. Yeah, 750 makes sense, I think, right? Maybe do a 750. Yeah, when we hit 750, we'll do this again. Thank you. Yeah, there's a recommendation. Next time we should drink while we do it.</p><p>Yeah. There you go. It could get really interesting. All right, everybody. For your chairman, dictator, Chamath Palihapitiya. Go get his sub stack. Really good. Check out Glue from your boy, David Sachs. And these giant potatoes that Dave's making. You get your hiring over at O'Halo? You need somebody? Any open positions?</p><p>Selectively. Very selectively. What are you looking for? What's the most hardcore position? I have a chief commercial officer role that I'm spending a lot of time on right now. Chief commercial officer? Is that like a chief revenue officer? Is that different? Yeah. It's the same thing? Yeah. And it's the same thing.</p><p>Why don't you make like a cantaloupe size russet potato for steakhouses? I think people would go wild for that, you know? Yeah. Watermelon size, giant. Watermelon size, yeah. Put it in the middle of the table, slice it open. And it could come loaded. No, but how do you- Loaded potato.</p><p>How do you cook it evenly? That's the hard part. When it's too big, it's hard to cook. You could also make French fries that are the size of like a lightsaber. Why don't you do that? The challenge of the potato- I would buy lightsaber size French fries. That would be amazing.</p><p>Double with the duck fat? You cook them in duck fat. Can you make us duck fat French fries, Dave? Oh my God, that would be incredible. Can you make us- Put it on a spit. Yeah, absolutely. Is our audience still there or have they left? They're still here. They're still here.</p><p>They're winding down because we're winding down. They are winding down, but it's still 6,700 people in the live. Don't you guys have anything better to do? I got to go. Not you, the audience. And we'll see you all- Nick, make sure, do you have everybody? Yes, I have their information.</p><p>I got it. You have everybody's information? And if not, just email nick@theallimpod.com. And if you, yeah, because we'll just make sure that you get on the list. I got it. Thanks everybody for your support. We love you. Thank you. - Thanks for tuning in.</p></div></div></body></html>
