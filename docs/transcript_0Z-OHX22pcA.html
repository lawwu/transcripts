You can build really serious wealth by just investing passively in low-cost index funds or ETFs. I'm not trying to beat the market. I'm not trying to time the market. The majority of my money is in index funds just trying to match the market performance.</p><p>I do personally like to be diversified across sectors and geographies. So some of those are international. Some of those are US-based. But I do have a bit of diversification in a couple different index funds. I also like to align the portfolio I have and I would recommend everyone think about their own level of risk tolerance and how much they're willing to stomach a drop if the market changes because that's an important thing that if you haven't experienced it before, it can be a little bit tough to experience.</p><p>And then I would just really avoid over-trading, unnecessary complexity. I don't like to spend a lot of time in my brokerage account thinking about it at all. In fact, most of mine is automated and it's not something I check on a daily basis.</p></div></div></body></html>
