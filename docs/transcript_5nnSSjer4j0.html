Some of my students are doing it. I think over the fairly short term, we're gonna get much better translators. And I'm excited for things like understanding documents. I think there's gonna be huge progress there over the next five to 10 years. Instead of giving Google some words and it'll find you all the documents have those words in, you give Google some themes and it'll find the documents that are saying that, even if they're saying it in different words. And so you're gonna be able to search for documents by what it is the documents are claiming, independent of whatever the words are. And that will be kind of useful.
