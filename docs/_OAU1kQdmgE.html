It's probably more a case of taking some bits and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">ignoring other bits and applying it to what you already do. Nonetheless I do believe that this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">approach, although I don't believe I can cover everything in this one video because there is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">lot to cover, I do believe what we will cover is at least a good foundation to tackling learning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">machine learning and of course other things as well. So let's start, specific to machine learning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's very important that I share my sort of view of different things in machine learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I think everything I need to learn seems to be somewhere on a scale of pure theory to pure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">application. Everything is kind of on that scale somewhere and I think both the theory and both</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the application are super important and I think when we're learning something it's pretty important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to find a balance of both and a lot of the time I really have to remind myself of this so I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">end up falling into one or the other too much. So I don't end up focusing purely on theory or purely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">on application. It's very important to have both of those because what you learn on the theory side</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of things is always going to support and back up the things that you are actually building. So when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you're actually applying your knowledge. We'll talk a little more about that later but I just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">wanted to cover that very quickly at the start just so we can kind of put everything in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">scope of that scale of theory to application. So the first thing I want to cover is my general</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">way of thinking when I am approaching something new to learn and that is to go shallow, deepen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and then broaden. So this applies when you are learning to code, when you are machine learning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">for the first time or when you are just learning something new in machine learning or learning a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">new framework or so on. Now what I mean more specifically by that is going back to that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">scale that we have. I start with applying something. In most cases, not all cases,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but most of the time I will start with trying to apply something. So I will take a library or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">topic and I will try and create some sort of shallow high level tool with it or pipeline with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it. And using that you should hopefully build a little bit of an understanding of the overall</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">scope or almost like an overall high level map of this topic or library. And with that you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">say okay I have this high level map and now I know okay the main components in whatever this is I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">learning seems to be these three or four things so I need to learn more about these things. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it's important we do this because a lot of people might skip this and if you don't try and understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what you are applying more deeply there's a good chance that you're not going to apply it correctly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or it's going to be a very sub-optimal thing that you're building. So I think it's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">important to try and understand things more deeply and this is going towards a theory side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Right so we're deepening our knowledge, understanding the theory behind whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this application is. And then once we've deepened our knowledge we should be able to better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">understand the topic. Okay and this is where we broaden things so we then go back to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">application side and we take what we've learned from the theory and reapply it to the application</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and hopefully at that point we've built something that's a bit more relevant. Now the reason that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I start shallow is because for me I find jumping straight into theory is often overwhelming,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it's confusing and there's just too much going on. I find it really helps to have that high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">level view of everything first and then from there going in and focusing on little bits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So starting shallow, keeping things simple as possible, then diving into the details</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and then coming back up and sort of broadening or fixing that more high level view that you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">created. The next one is courses and projects. Now most people know and do study on courses and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this is 100% the way to go. You have platforms like Coursera and Udemy which are in my opinion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">amazing. You have a lot of things out there and then you also have a lot of free courses on places</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">like YouTube. On my channel there are even a few free courses that you can follow along. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">there really is a huge amount of content out there and whether you want to pay for it or not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you can probably find something. However doing course after course is I don't think usually a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">good idea because courses are, they exist in their own sort of isolated world. The data is usually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">perfect, the approach to doing something it works because someone else has already done it and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">they're showing you exactly step by step how to do it. So it's not always a good idea to just keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">doing courses. Instead what I think really helps is doing projects. Okay so doing projects as well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">as courses. Projects are really good because they emulate what you're going to be doing in the real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">world of applying machine learning. You're actually working on something, you're building something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't know if it's going to work at the start but you're trying to figure it out. And what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">very good in terms of your learning with these projects is one I think projects can be really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">fun and motivating. It's really cool to start a project and work on something and actually build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">something.

So to build something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you can't just skip like a component of whatever it is you're building, you need to be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OAU1kQdmgE&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">use it and apply it correctly.
