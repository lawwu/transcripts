What's good with you, fam? - My guy. Sir, what's good, guy? - All right, bro. So let's get it poppin'. So first I wanna start off at high school. Do you remember how we met? - Yeah, for sure. Nike Elite, what is it?</p><p>- You know, at the top of Hunter Camp? - You know, in St. Louis. - Yeah, I remember 'cause I remember seeing this light-skinned dude. And he was like, you was like what, like five? You was like five, what are you like? - Probably like five, six. - And he was just gettin' buckets, you know?</p><p>- No, no, no, no, no, I was like probably 10. - But everybody was at that camp. And that's when I first met you. And then we, and then the time when we, the time I really remember was we was at that gym with Mo Can, you walked in the door.</p><p>Coach Perry was like, man, it's this kid comin'. He's like the best point guard in the area. And I had no idea who it was, and you walked in the door. And I was like, man, this dude, I remember this dude. But I didn't remember you being that good from the camp.</p><p>And then we had a practice or whatever, and you was like, you was killin', like, same game you have now, you was doin' your thing. And then that's when we linked up. - No, for real, I remember that 'cause that was right after, 'cause that was my first time goin' to practice, goin' to Kansas City.</p><p>I think that was the first time we actually linked after game 100 was that practice was great. - Yeah, how did you even, what made you wanna play with Mo Can, though? - Reason why I came over to Mo Can, Coach P hit me up, Matt Souther, told me I was able to come play with you.</p><p>I was playin' in Dallas, and our team wouldn't really like that. - Oh, I didn't know. - I was tryin' to play on the 17U level, and then I was tryin' to come over to Nike and play with Mo Can. So they gave me the opportunity to play with you, so I was like.</p><p>- It was great. - Yeah. - I mean, for the jump, we had like a crazy chemistry, like, from the jump. And that was our 16s, and we was playin' up 17s, I think. - Yeah, it made it easy 'cause we were both young, and we were outta town, and we, remember we had to stay over at Coach Dave's house all the time?</p><p>- Yeah, Coach Dave's. - So we had a lot of time, we was just in the basement, chillin', watchin' games. - So that's when we, yeah, that's when we first got real close, we was tryin' to sneak out the crib. - Yeah. (laughing) - Yeah, I remember that, so.</p><p>And then, so that 16s year, we had that year, and we made PGM, we ended up losin' the pool play, right? - Yeah, we, I don't even think we won two games. - I think we won two out of three. - Yeah. - And then we was like, but we knew we had the potential to be like, cold.</p><p>- Yeah, yeah. - And so, we knew we was gonna come back that next year, and then 17s, we came back, and we was dominant. I think we lost, what, one game? Two games? - Yeah, two games all season. - Which one do you think we should watch, this one or this one?</p><p>- Nah, bro, the PGM one, bro. - This one? I ain't seen it. We was so tough, bro. - Okay, first play of the game was good. - That was the first play of the game. - Our whole class is pretty much in the lead. - Yeah, we were.</p><p>Good, Tae. - Lay. - Good, Tae. Oh, look at you in there. - Yeah, we was getting too hyped, yo. First half, we were all right. Hey, he was not missing, though. - Jarrett, where? - That whole PGM? - I know, bro. I mean, I be telling people we was, like, the best AU program ever, like, ever.</p><p>- Yeah, I mean, we in the conversation, for sure. I think we, I can't argue with my friends all the time, like, players, they always talk about the AU team. Like, I don't see a team that can match up with us. - Nah, 'cause it was like, we went to PGM, and it wasn't like we was winning by two or 10 or whatever.</p><p>We was winning by, like, 30. - Every game. - Every game. - So, what was your favorite memories, would you say, from that whole, from that whole, like, AU side of, side of thing? - I think, really, just what we were just talking about, like, the time when we were going and having those three days on Saturdays, and, like, throughout the day, we're always kicking it with each other.</p><p>Like, me and you, with the team, like, we're either going to watch other games, or we're at the crib, or we're doing something. Like, we're always with each other. - We were always together, every weekend, and I'm up there. - Every weekend. So, for us, out of state, like, we were always, me and you were always together, 'cause we didn't have nowhere else to go.</p><p>Like, I mean, your parents were always busy, like, your family, mine, same way. Like, they're doing their stuff, so we were always with each other. So, that's what I think, why we were so close. - We got close. - Crazy. - We went, remember, we was trying to make college work, too.</p><p>- Yeah. - Trying to make the college thing work, but we could never get it to happen. What was your favorite camp we did? Like, any of that? We did so much, we did Chile, the two USA, the... - You think NBA Top 100 was fun? - I thought it was, it was fun.</p><p>It was like, it was informative, 'cause we'd hoop, and we'd have the class stuff. - Yeah. - And everybody was there, though. That's what I like about it. Every good player was there. - That's what I think about it, yeah. - But it was cool, you was killing. That's really like when you took a leap.</p><p>That, I remember seeing that video, I think it was A Baller's Life, that came out of you and Gary going back and forth. - Oh yeah, me and Gary went back, yeah. - Yeah, that was crazy. - No, that was cool, that was cool. We had a, yeah, USA, that was just a long, a long trip.</p><p>- Bro, they kept trying to make you say, "Thank you." Remember? (laughing) - Look, you're not allowed to say thank you. (laughing) - Bro, I was, bro, I was good like man. - Oh wait, that's my teammate now. - Who? Who? - Oh yeah, I'm here. - Oh yeah, is he, is he playing?</p><p>- I don't know. - Yeah, he's playing a little bit. - They were really tripping on saying, "Thank you." - No, that's, it was for the assist. - I know. - To the mic. - Hey. - Look, you gotta say it. Look, I know you didn't say it. (laughing) I knew it, I already knew it.</p><p>- USA was crazy, but the food they gave us was so weak. Hey. - Look, no you didn't say it. (laughing) You didn't say it. You didn't say it in fast enough. - Bro, that is. - They was tripping on that too. You had to say it like. - I mean, that was the thing, if you was throwing, you had to be the USA, you know what I'm saying?</p><p>- You were MVP. - Yeah, nah, I remember, I don't know. - I was back there, Matt Coleman. 'Cause we had like, it was like, we had a camp, and then we went to Team Europe. No, we had Peach Jam, I think. And then we went to some camp.</p><p>And then we did Chile. And then we went to another Nike camp. We was with each other for like a month. And like, people, we got so tired of each other. Me and this dude got so tired of each other. And I remember we was in Chile, and Chile was so crazy.</p><p>Is that how you pronounce it, Chile? - Chile, yeah. - We was up there, and we had been with each other for like a month, and then we was like, rooming together the whole time. We was so tired of each other. And I think that's the only time we really got to like, a real, like, fight.</p><p>We got to like, an argument, you remember that? - Yeah, we were in LA though. We were at the Skills Academy. - That's when we got in a fight? - Yeah, that was the last place. - That was the last place, we was so tired of each other. - It was all, all because I was on FaceTime, and he wanted me to turn off the lights.</p><p>- So this is what happened. So we had been with each other for like a month, and I'm tired, I'm trying to go to sleep. This dude on FaceTime with his girl, and I'm like, "Bro, turn the light off." But he had the light on. I'm like, "Bro, you can't FaceTime with the light off." He's like, "Nah, bro, I want the light on." So I get up out of my bed, and I go, "Turn the light off." Soon as I get back from my bed, he turned the light back on, I'm like, "Bro." So I get back up, turn the light off.</p><p>He turned it back on again, and then like, literally we both just was so like, irritated with each other, we started fighting, like, actually like, fighting. - For real, for real. - I think, yeah, I got a picture somewhere, but. - I do remember that. - That was. - Hey, you was, it was a trip, bro.</p><p>- No, that was fun, though. - But going, like, from high school, so you was ranked like, I think like in the 20 to 30 range. But like, every player you played against in your position, you was killing. - Yeah. - But they still had you ranked, so like, so they didn't have you ranked, like, high enough.</p><p>Why do you think that was? Like, what were people tripping about with you, and what was the, like, criticism you got in high school? - I think it was just more like, just my, just my, nobody really thought that my game would translate to the next level, I think.</p><p>And for me, it was just about showing it. I think once I got to college, and played on TV, and played in front of all these people, like, my game, you know this, like, my game hasn't really changed since high school. So it's like, it's really just since, once I got on a national stage, and played in front of more people, more eyes, more people saw my game and could translate.</p><p>So that's really what it was. And I think it was just people, and you know, people can, people can boost, and like, you should've been number one player in high school. - Yeah. - For the longest, but it's like, everything is, it's all politics, like, it's all politics. - It's all, and they'll find something, like, if they don't, and it's so crazy, 'cause they'll judge these kids, but like, look at what you're doing right now.</p><p>Like, they wasn't looking at what you was doing right now. Every matchup you had against another good point guard, you was killing 'em. So, but they was basing everything off of potential. - Yeah. - But like, that's what I don't get about, like, some of these rankers, or analysts, or whatever.</p><p>Like, you're doing the same exact thing. Your game hasn't changed. I remember one of the things they said was like, they didn't think you was athletic enough, or couldn't get your shot off at the next level. But like, athleticism is more than just having balance. Like, you ain't got no balance, but you got, like, every other athleticism you have.</p><p>Like, you're quick, you're one of the fastest players in the league. Like, and you get your shot off whenever you want. Your body control is crazy, and that's like, they was missing that. But like, we always knew that you was like, and I used to always tell you, like, you're the number one point guard.</p><p>And then, 'cause we used to debate who was number one and number two. You remember that? - For real, for real. I was always number one in the class, and you was number two. - Who used to win one-on-one? Don't cap. All right, if we're not gonna cap. All right, you got me, but it don't give the height difference, man.</p><p>You get to your spots, and you just... - I used to kill every one-on-one. - Man, we gonna run it back now. - But, so we gonna go, we gonna transition to now college. So you do your thing in high school, all of high school, and then you go to college at Oklahoma.</p><p>Why did you pick Oklahoma? - Just being able to be me. Like, for real, like, just being able to go to a school. Like, we were talking about that, like, picking our school. We wanted to go to places where we could be ourselves and be, I mean, just us.</p><p>And I had trust in Coach Krueger and the staff that they were telling me, everything that they told me was gonna come true. And, I mean, it kind of did. My whole plan was to be there two years. - Yeah. So you didn't even think you was gonna do what you did that first year?</p><p>- I mean, I had thought it, but like, for me, I didn't want to put the pressure on myself to go in, like, for you, it was different. You know what I'm saying? Like, you were gifted, bro. Like, you had everything, you had everything. Like, for me, I had to go, like, I was thinking, like, two years maybe.</p><p>And if it happened, it happened. It happened the right way. And so, it's a blessing, bro. - Nah, it was crazy. I used to always tell people, like, from knowing you, when you're put in a situation where you can do your thing and, like, an organization gives you the keys, whether that's MoCan, whether that's Oklahoma, whether that's, you know, the Atlanta Hawks, you're gonna be dominant.</p><p>But, like, when the team tries to put you in a box, that's when you can't be Trey Young, and then you'll probably just be an average player. 'Cause I remember, we was playing Team USA, and they had all these point guards ahead of you that they wanted the point guards just to distribute, not really look for their own shot, not shoot the deep threes or whatever.</p><p>And you, like, you struggled in Team USA. And I used to, like, I just knew the whole time it was 'cause you weren't put in a situation where you could beat Trey. - Yeah. - But, like-- - Yeah, nah, you-- Nah, I know, it's like, we was in our room talking about it.</p><p>Like, after games, like, I was hyped, like, everything, and we won, but remember how we was talking? Like, we've been talking about this stuff since then. So, nah, you right, like, if you put us in a box, like, it's hard for us to really, to flourish. - Right. - For our skills to show.</p><p>- I'm glad we in situations now in the league where we can do our thing. You've been doing it, you know, I was just starting to kind of find my flow with Nicola and Jamal, but, like, you, from the moment you stepped in, you was balling. - Yeah, you've been out with injury.</p><p>Now you're getting back into it. You see it, like, as I've been watching you play. Like, you're getting more, like, into it. - Starting to get into it. - Yeah, you starting to get into it. You can see the confidence, like, everybody has in you. Like, they give you the rock, and it's, the coach has in you, like, that just, it makes, it brings the best out of you.</p><p>- Nah, dude, like, the, like, coaches, man, like, the situation you're in plays such a key role into, like, who you can be as a player. And that's why I tell people, like, to talk about the league. Like, my friends over there, but, like, there's so many cold players in the league that will never really be, like, who they could be just because of the situation.</p><p>But, like, you go put 'em in, like, a, like, a run in the summertime, and they'll, they're gonna look amazing. You know what I'm saying? - Yeah. - And there's so many players like that. Like, the one that comes to mind is Trayvon Duvall. Like, remember how cold he was?</p><p>Like-- - Trayvon was nice. - Or, and then, like, he just doesn't, hasn't really found a situation. But there's so many players that's kind of like that. Like, they just don't find a situation. So we're blessed, 'cause-- - Yeah. - We're in good, good programs. - Yeah, that's tough.</p><p>I was thinking Trayvon, who's another guy, like? - Billy, I think. - Billy? - Billy Preston. I mean, he's one that, like, was cold in high school. I don't know what he's doing now, but, like, I always thought he'd be in the league. And then Kevin Knox is another one, I think, who was real talented at high school.</p><p>He's in the league now in New York, and, like, he hasn't really gotten the situation, the opportunity to be him. You know what I'm saying? - He's there, yeah. - But there's countless players in the league that's like that. - Yeah, I agree. - Yeah, for sure. Last thing about college, what's, so the situation you was in, what's one piece of advice you would give to a freshman going into college that received as much attention as you, but at the same time is trying to keep team chemistry?</p><p>- Oh, that's a good question. I mean, for me, it was tough. Like, I had, like, 'cause I had a bunch of, I had a bunch of, like, older guys. Like, I had a, it wasn't a bunch of young guys, so it was like-- - The older team? - Yeah, it was more of an older team, the team that the year before didn't do well, they didn't make the tournament.</p><p>And then this team was supposed to be here, and, like, you got an All-American coming in, and it's like, and he's getting all the national attention, and they're just right there, so, you know what I'm saying? They saw a team, and it's like, the only person I really had that was really close to me on the team was a couple of guys that were freshmen, and then my roommate, Cam Augusti.</p><p>And then, besides that, it was all older guys, and they kind of stuck together, and it was like, it was hard, it was hard. For me, it was just, it was a learning thing, a learning thing for me, just having to talk to guys, and just make sure I keep it team.</p><p>- Try not to step on toes, but still, at the same time, let them know, like, nah, you're the man. - Yeah. - Like, this is my joint, but y'all, like, I feel like that'd be so hard. That's why I asked the question, 'cause, like, I feel like, especially in college, you get them older dudes, and the freshmen coming in, and he by far the best player.</p><p>Like, how do you keep that case? - Yeah, you just kinda just gotta, like, talk, you just gotta just be, you just kinda just gotta be yourself, like, don't ever let the, don't ever let the national media and, - Yeah. - You know what I'm saying, all that get to your head, and just make you change, 'cause, like, if you come in one way, and then all this stuff comes at you, and you're a different person, then they see that, you know what I'm saying?</p><p>But if you're the same person from beginning to end, they see that, too, and I think that's something that, I mean, I didn't struggle with, but it was just, as far as changing myself, but it was just, like, a situation where, I mean, I think it was good, and I just had to learn, and learn that on my own.</p><p>- Right, 'cause lookin' in, like, y'all, like, y'all, look from the outside, y'all was good, but y'all, like, I just wondered that, like, y'all were really good, but I didn't know if y'all could be better, if the chemistry was better, 'cause y'all were, like, what, like, top five for a second, then y'all start losin'.</p><p>- Yeah, we got all the way up to number, number three in the country. - Then why y'all start losin'? - We started seein' teams twice in the Big 12. - Oh, for real? - So the second time, teams, - They figured y'all out? - Yeah, they weren't, they were teamin' me, and, you know, I just, I just, I just, I don't know.</p><p>- But let's talk to the league then, bro. So you, so, so you in the league now, your first year you did really, really good, your second year you're an all-star, and then, so, like, now, from now on, people kinda view you as, like, oh, he's supposed to be an all-star from here on out, like, and, and that was your second year in the NBA, and people expect you to play at this all-star level, which, I feel like you should've been an all-star this year, like, like, no question.</p><p>But how do you, my question for you is, how do you deal with, like, the expectations now, going forward, and just not putting that pressure on yourself, but at the same time, like, you know what I'm sayin'? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, for me it's, I, like, you just can't worry about it.</p><p>Like, you just, for me, like, I've gotten to the point now where, like, I don't, I don't care about other people's expectations on me. Like, my expectations of myself are higher than anybody else's could be. So it's like, I mean, nothing they say is, is gonna make me feel some type of way when anybody else puts on me.</p><p>Like, I'm, I know what I, what I want, and you know what I'm sayin'? Like, I know-- - And it's higher than any, what anybody else could expect from you, anyways. - Yeah, yeah, and so that's, that's, that's how I'm just, that's how I go about it, that's how I think.</p><p>- Yeah, I feel like, like, a lot of young players, especially, but I know, like, me and you used to, me and you used to struggle with this, too, 'cause we'd look up our name on Twitter, see people talking about, like, as young players, you tend to want to, like, you play a lot of times for the approval of other people, like, you want them to talk good about you, you want people to, you know, approve of how you're playing, whatever, and then, like, if you're not meeting that, it can really, like, weigh on you.</p><p>But then, as you get older, and you get to the NBA, you see there's so many games, there's so many highs and lows, then you kinda learn, like, okay, I'm not playing for the fans, I'm not playing for, for the approval of other people, I'm just playing 'cause I love the game, and because, like, I wanna be the best I can be.</p><p>And then that kinda lets you play free. And I know you, like, you be playing so free out there, so I know you kinda have a mindset of, like, you're not worried about what other people are saying. - Yeah, yeah, but it took me a while to get to this point.</p><p>Like, and I think it's tough, 'cause our generation is, like, is the first generation that's really going through this, 'cause, like, the older people, like, I mean-- - They ain't have no social media. - They ain't have no social media. This is new to them, like, they're, like, like, a lot of the older guys in the league, like, they're, they didn't have to go from college, and you're on your Twitter all the, like, in high school, and, like, we've been doing this since high school.</p><p>Like, and so, like, to be able to do that through high school and college, and then know when you get to the NBA that all that doesn't matter, and, like, all that looking for approval, like you said, like, that stuff doesn't matter. Like, it's hard to, like, shut that off.</p><p>But once you, if you understand that as an early, like, at an early age, I think that can help you, I mean, like you said, the better you're gonna be. - Yeah, no facts. And I think, like, I be saying, like, humans in general, people view NBA players like we're not really human.</p><p>Like, we don't have emotions, we don't see certain stuff on social media. And I be saying, like, no human is supposed to experience that much praise, and no human is supposed to experience that much, like, hate. Like, if you have a good game or a bad game, you know?</p><p>Like, the way that fans talk about you is just crazy. And social media obviously plays, like, the biggest part into it, 'cause they just, it's easy for them to just comment whatever they want on your picture. But like, but like you said, like, no one, the generation before didn't have to deal with that.</p><p>We received so much, like, praise, which I feel like can be a bad thing, 'cause it gets people's head too big, and they start changing it, and they start playing for that praise. But then also, like, the criticism that we be getting, like, if we don't meet people's expectations, it's crazy.</p><p>You know what I'm saying? - No, no, that's, that's crazy, bro. - No. - It's wild, bro. - I can go on there for days talking about, like. - No, say something about it, then. Like, how you be feeling, how you be feeling about that? - I mean, for me, like, I don't, like, I just, I don't talk about, I don't, for me, it took a while to really get away from, like, not caring about other people's approval.</p><p>Like, you know what I'm saying? My, I don't know, like, I literally have a, excuse my language, not give a fuck, like, motto. Like, that's just, I just don't. Like, I just, like, unless it's important to me, like, if you can't help me, or, like, you're not benefiting, like, helping me, or my family, or whatever, like, it's, I don't care about your opinion.</p><p>- Yeah, like, yeah, who are you? All these people talking, stuff, like, you never even gonna meet 'em, and they don't even care about you, like, you know what I'm saying? And that thing, I realized, like, bro, you can be as good, you can be the best player in the NBA, and have everything, and then, like, if you have a bad game, they still gonna talk crazy about you.</p><p>- Yeah. - You know what I'm saying? So, if you feed into that, bro, like, your emotions are gonna be on such a rollercoaster, 'cause you can never live up to what people want. People want perfection, like, fans want perfection. - And you've seen guys, you've seen guys in the league go, like, leave the league, 'cause they just, they're so mentally, like-- - Yeah, they don't know how to deal with the pressure.</p><p>- The pressure is tough, and it's, like, some of you, it's a real thing, like, a real struggle people have. - It's a real struggle, and I just, I think, like, what really makes, like, the best the best, the more I'm thinking about it, is not, like, how people handle, like, the praise, but it's almost, like, how people can bounce back from the bad games, or the criticism, and they get right back on their, like, what they do.</p><p>Like, you know, we've been talking, we've both been talking to Brett, you know, our mental strength guy, help us out with that stuff. But he was just telling me the other day, like, Tiger Woods, like, he's won, like, he's lost way more matches than he's won, but he's still considered the best ever.</p><p>And it's got me thinking, like, what really, like, separates the greatest is really how they handle, like, losses. You know what I'm saying? - Yeah. - So I think, like, and for me, really, that's why I kind of get off social media, because, like, it's easier to stay locked in and not really care what people think when you're not getting all the comments, and not getting all the whatever.</p><p>There's other reasons, too. You know, the females. - Yeah, yeah. - But that's a big reason, so. - Yeah. - Yeah, bro, like, I was gonna ask you, too. So, especially this year, like, in general, like, from the outside looking in, it's been a lot of talk about the way you draw fouls.</p><p>You know, Steve Nash said he wasn't playing basketball or whatever, but to me, it's like, you're utilizing the rules of the game. You're doing what they're giving you. And, like, in the past, when players have figured out the game and figured out how to, like, take advantage of it, then it can cause, like, people, them to change the rules or whatever, but that's not the player's fault.</p><p>That's being smart and having a good IQ. So what do you think about, like, people criticizing you, like, especially this year? - Yeah, I mean, for, especially with the foul drawing, like, I'm just, it's kind of frustrating. I mean, Steve brought up, like, how smart I am at drawing fouls.</p><p>Like, how good I am at drawing fouls. Like, the media took the "that's not basketball" and just blew it up. Like, I was kind of frustrated at first when I saw it, but then I saw the whole quote and I saw what he said. But, like, me drawing fouls, like, that's just-- - That's smart.</p><p>- It's just smart. - I don't see why people would get mad at you, and why they, I see why people might get mad at the rules. Like, if you, like-- - Don't blame me, like, blame the rules. - That's just being smart, like, you just, that's being smart, like, if you, if they wanna change the rules, make it so, like, if you pump fake and then you jump into someone, that's not a foul, or it's an offensive foul, but don't get mad at someone, like, utilizing the rules.</p><p>- Yeah, yeah, I'm just, that's the thing. Like, I'm not doing anything that the rules aren't saying I can't do, you know what I'm saying? - Right, exactly. - I'm just, like, if a dude, and the thing is, is, like, people already hate that a smaller guy like me is, is, like, doing what I'm doing, and so, like, they're gonna try to be physical, and try to be, like, the thing that, I know what, like, the game plan against me is, be physical, be rough 'em up, like-- - So you learn how to use-- - So I'm just learning how to, when they go, okay, you wanna bump me, all right, let's just, we go off the screen, I know you gonna bump me, so I'm just gonna stop and just let you keep running.</p><p>- Right. - You know what I'm saying? Like, there's little things that I just, I'm, like, especially when my starting stops, like, like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go off the screen, I'll go full speed, and the natural thing is, if I stop, your momentum is still going, like, you still-- - You gonna hit your-- - You gonna hit me regardless.</p><p>- That's gonna be a foul, and that's, that is a foul, but that's, that's smart. - Yeah. - Now, that had me tripping, too, like, how people gonna get mad at you for, for being a smart player? - It's, it's, it is what it is nowadays. That's what I'm talking about when it comes to social media, it's like, like, now, it's like, I don't, I don't like that.</p><p>Like, I don't care about that no more. - You don't care about none of that. - Like, I don't care about that no more. Like, maybe back a couple years ago, like, when I'm in college, and rookie year, like, that stuff fazed me, but it don't anymore. - So, criticism, like, you would say you don't care, or did, like, some people could use it to make 'em better, or some people use it, and then they fall, and they don't know what to do with criticism.</p><p>Do you, you just don't care about it at all, or do you feel like it make you better? - I, I think it's, I think you pick and choose. I think you, you, you hear everything. You know what I'm saying? Like, I hear everything. You know what I'm saying?</p><p>I'm gonna, I'm gonna pick and choose what I let, I mean, let inside, and let it affect me, and what I don't, you know what I'm saying, so. - That's, I mean, bro, that's what separates you, 'cause I'm, like, a lot of players can't do that, especially with the attention, and, you know, the criticism, and, like, the love, and the hate that you receive.</p><p>Like, a lot of players can't do that. How would you say the NBA is different on the court and off the court than, like, college or high school? - I mean. - On the, we'll start with on the court. Like, how, how is the game different? - On the court, I mean, it's just the spacing.</p><p>- Yeah. - Like, the spacing. Like, I look at college games now, and, like. - It's hard to watch. - It's hard to watch it, just 'cause, like, the defensive three safeties, like, the fact that somebody can sit in the lane, and you can't, you can't drive, and all that stuff.</p><p>That's, it's hard to watch, and I think that's the most frustrating thing, like, the college game, and the difference from that, in the NBA, is the spacing, and the, the fact that everybody can hoop. Like. - In the league? - Everybody, yeah. - Like, there's no weak link, but if you leave a player open, he probably gonna make a shot, even if he's the 12th man on the bench.</p><p>- Yeah. - He's still called. - Still good, so. I think that's, that's the difference, and then off the court, it's like, I don't know, it's like, you don't have to worry about anything. - You got the bread, you got the money, you can do what you want. - Yeah, it's more about treating this like it's, basically, you get the option of treating basketball how you want it, you know what I'm saying?</p><p>It's like, you have everything, so you, you have this time after basketball, like, you get to pick, you wanna-- - You get to pick what, yeah, you get to pick what you wanna do. - You wanna, you wanna, how, how good do you wanna be? - You wanna lock in, and, and use your money, like, to buy a chef, to help your body, whatever, and you wanna use your money to fly five girls out to the crib, and, or go out, and, you know.</p><p>- Yeah, spending all the money on bottles and stuff, and do all that, or you can do, or you can spend that money on, like you said, a chef, like, like, so it's, it's, that's really the difference. - It's like, the difference almost then is like, whatever you dreamed that you could do in high school or college, now you can actually do.</p><p>- Yeah. - That's why a lot of people get the league, then they fall off, 'cause like, they have the world in their, in their hands, and they don't stay locked, like, their whole goal, I think one of the biggest, like, differences between players that really, like, become really good, and players that just get to the league and kind of fizzle out, is like, what was your goal?</p><p>Like, was your goal just to make the NBA, and then you just wanted to live the lifestyle? Or was your goal to be, like, one of the best players, and like, really, like, you really love basketball? You know what I mean? - Yeah, yeah, it's definitely a difference of, of mindsets, whatever, of, of guys.</p><p>You can tell, like, guys, as you, as you start playing, on what guys really focus on, too, you know. - What do you think is the next step for you, and your game, to become, like, the player you ultimately could become? - Um, I think for me, I think for me, it's all just about winning, you know what I'm saying?</p><p>Like, I mean, I'm always gonna be, I mean, I've, I've done, done a lot of things, couple years already, but, I mean, all the individual stuff is gonna come, like, like, I think I'm always, one thing I've always took from Coach P is, win takes care of everything. Like, if you win, everybody gonna eat.</p><p>You know what I'm saying? So, like, winning, I know for me, like, all the individual stuff, like, all that, all that stuff's gonna come, like, it's, for me, like, to be looked at, like, looked at different. - As a winner. - I wanna be looked at as a winner, so that's why.</p><p>- Like, CP3, like, now, at this point in his career, everywhere he go, like, his, his reputation now is he's just a winner. - Yeah. - He can go to any, any organization. - Just stick around the league for years doing that. - Turn it around, yeah. - So, I feel that.</p><p>What do you, so, so, how are you gonna spend your off-seasons, or what do you like to do outside of hoop? - I like being, I like being, like, with my close people, friends, family, I mean, vacation, I mean, I play blackjacks. - I feel that. - We'll be in Vegas.</p><p>- We definitely gonna be in Vegas on the roulette, for sure. - Oh, yeah, okay. - Or, or, where did we go, Bahamas? - Yeah, Bahamas. - We was on the roulette, losing crazy. (both laughing) - We didn't even, we didn't even go to the beach for real, bro, we was in the casino the whole time.</p><p>- Yes, fam. All right, this is my last question for you. What would you say is your, what do you view as your purpose, like, what's your purpose? - Oh, my purpose is, my purpose is just making sure, making sure my family is good, and then also inspiring the next generation, and making sure the game is better than it's left, I mean, for me, I get frustrated sometimes with the older players, not understanding that the game, it's okay if the game is better today, you know what I'm saying, like, it's because of y'all, like, the game, y'all made the game better, or whatever, and so now it's, LeBron came in from Jordan, then Steph came in, changed the game, like, the game gets better over time, so for me, I just wanna be one of those guys, hopefully, that makes the game a little bit better, and inspire others.</p><p>- Inspire others, that's dope, bro, well, I appreciate you coming on this joint, this is dope, man, my guy. - What's the show called again? - Curious Mike. - Curious Mike. - Shout out to Lemon Perfect, too, hold it up, shout out to Lemon Perfect. - Shout out to Lemon Perfect, body armor too, though.</p><p>- This episode was sponsored by Lemon Perfect.
