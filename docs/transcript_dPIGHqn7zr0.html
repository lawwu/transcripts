This question came up recently for a listener named Ryan in Houston Pastor John in the wake of recent events this summer in Charlottesville president obama shared this quote from nelson mandela on social media quote No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion People must learn to hate and if they can learn to hate they can be taught to love For love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite end quote Several news agencies are reporting that this is now the most liked tweet of all time But it seems contrary to the teaching of scripture pastor. John. What are your thoughts on mandela's words here? I have Several thoughts about that quote i've tried to Think about it um in a way That could affirm it i'm trying to get inside his skin And think is there is there a way to affirm it? as a christian rather than just my my knee-jerk reaction to bring clear biblical teaching against it, which I'm going to do eventually in a in a way So let me try to to break it down first No one is born Hating another person he says because of the color of his skin Or his background or his religion people must learn to hate now, that's tricky Um, here's a way to defend it When we are born The bible teaches that we have a nature That is rebellious against god 1 corinthians 2 14 says we are Naturally unable to discern spiritual things like the beauty of god and his ways Romans 8 7 and 8 says that by nature we're unwilling and unable to submit to god's Law and to please god ephesians 2 3 says we are by nature Children of wrath that is we are so opposed to god that it is just of god to pour his wrath out Against us romans 3 10 says there's none righteous. No, not one romans 3 23 says we've all Sinned and fallen short of the glory of god psalm 51 5 says We were born in iniquity and in sin did our mothers conceive us now. Here's the catch This fallen nature This sinfulness is essentially proud and selfish and self-exalting And resistant to god and what exalts god over all things but the form That this pride and selfishness takes is learned It is it's largely shaped by our parents and our culture one form that this sinfulness can take is hatred toward people who are different from us and being bigoted and angry and Wanting to create as much separation as we can but another form that it can take is a way of Relating that wins the praise of others by doing helpful things for others Even others who are different from us There are many vain selfish anti-god people who have learned to treat others with decency and respect because There are very significant advantages to living that way Especially if there's a group of people that you care about who praise that behavior very highly and thus build up your Ego while you treat people that way. So yes We do learn to hate In the sense that our parents and our culture channels our natural Segregation into forms of opposition to people like us or we may learn to channel our selfishness into benevolent ways that provide Ego satisfaction for ourselves and win a good deal of praise from other people we admire now the next part of mandela statement says They can be taught to love Now if love here simply means a kind of behavior that gives practical help rather than hurt to others That's true That's what we saw already But that's not what the bible calls love Paul says in first corinthians 13 3 if I give away all I have And deliver up my body to be burned and don't have love I gain nothing so The love that the bible cares about Is not merely giving our goods to the poor Or being willing to sacrifice our bodies Love as second corinthians 8 1 and 2 describes starts with being overwhelmed By being loved by god by the grace of god to us in our guilt in our lack of deserving and then Flowing with joy in god to meet the needs of others and draw them into sharing our joy in god Which doesn't just last for 80 years, but for 80 000 years even to people Unlike us in fact, especially Jesus says to our enemies we pour out that kind of love the reason it matters to define love As coming from an experience of grace is that without this we perish under god's wrath God has made a way for us to enjoy his favor And if we don't come to christ And confess our lovelessness and receive forgiveness and find our treasure in god himself We will perish under god's punishment and this means That the effort to teach people to act lovingly, but not To love with the love of god not to have the love of god Flowing through us because of jesus and the forgiveness of our sins through faith in him to teach people to love without that That effort is not loving because it leaves people lost in their sin and And and that's all covered by a veneer Of good deeds and therefore it's very destructive And finally mandela says For love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite if love Simply means doing many beneficial things for people You could see why this might be true for example a mother more naturally feeds her child Than throwing the child over a cliff, right? Almost everybody would agree. It's more natural Most women find it more natural to be nurturing and Feed her infant than to throw him over a waterfall but apart from christ And his saving work that natural love Exists in a heart that is hostile to god does not submit to his law Every one of us has a fundamentally self-exalting heart Which to be sure will do many things that benefit others But are no expression of submission to god or desire that others find their joy in god if love As the bible teaches is far more than learned behaviors But is the overflow of joy in being forgiven through jesus christ and finding him as our supreme Treasure and desiring that others come and join us in that Everlasting pleasure even at great cost to ourselves then Love does not come naturally to the human heart. It is in fact diametrically opposed to what we are By nature the human heart is proud and selfish and resistant to the authority of god and insubordinate to his commands including The command to love in the power that god supplies for the glory of god. So my prayer for myself And others is that we christians would pursue love in this world by pursuing faith in christ Since whatever is not from faith Is sin romans 14 23 And it is unloving To train people to act in ways that look loving But are only sin Yeah, very good.
