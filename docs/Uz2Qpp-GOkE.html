So when, for example, you, and this is something anybody can try,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz2Qpp-GOkE&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">take a very long document, like needle in a haystack, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz2Qpp-GOkE&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">sure, we can do information retrieval on specific fact-finding activities pretty easily.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz2Qpp-GOkE&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you, I kind of think about it like summarizing, if you write a book report on an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz2Qpp-GOkE&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">entire book versus a synopsis of each individual chapter, there is a characteristic output length</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz2Qpp-GOkE&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">for these models. Let's say it's about 1200 tokens. It is very difficult to get any of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz2Qpp-GOkE&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">commercial LLMs or LLAMA to write 5,000 tokens.

And I think the problem of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz2Qpp-GOkE&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm deciding how to decompose large documents into more kind of atomic reasoning units is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz2Qpp-GOkE&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">still very important. Now it's an open question, whether you have in the, whether that is a model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz2Qpp-GOkE&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that is addressable by pre-training or instruction tuning, like can you have synthesis oriented</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz2Qpp-GOkE&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">demonstrations in the, at training time?

I think that process of idea generation is absolutely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz2Qpp-GOkE&t=3253" target="_blank">00:54:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">automatable.
