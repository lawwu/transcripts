What are some of the lessons you've learned from all those conversations? - I've also worked for them. One thing I've noticed is that I think we all imagine that they're better than us. And when you actually meet millionaires or multimillionaires or billionaires, nope, not really.</p><p>And that's beautiful, right? 'Cause that means that everyone has a chance to create whatever life they want. There are gifted people. Like Zuckerberg is definitely smarter than most people. Bill Gates who I've worked for is smarter than most people. Peter Thiel who I've gotten to hang out with a little bit, smarter than most people.</p><p>But there's also a lot of billionaires, Larry Janeski. I would say he's very smart, but he's also a pretty normal guy. Now, I would say some of the things in common between them is that most of them got rich off one thing, but all of us diversify. It's actually counterintuitive.</p><p>They're like, "Diversify, diversify." But they only really got rich one way. It's either real estate or it's tech. Outside of inheritance, it's almost exclusively one thing. They stick with it for extraordinary long periods of time.</p></div></div></body></html>
