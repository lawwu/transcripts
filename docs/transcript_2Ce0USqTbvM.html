But if it's just a quick look, it's 15 minutes. I did that for the betterment of the profession. I wanted patients to do well through the process. And it wasn't because I wanted them to stay with me.</p><p>A lot of the time I would send them back and say, you know what? They're right. Or it would be a lot of these second opinions are about bad dental work. And then I would send, I would give them an option. There's a very inexpensive option. Instead of hiring a lawyer, there's a peer review system.</p><p>And I would hook them up with that. Every dental society has a peer review system. They go in, they have three dentists look at it. If it is bad dental work, then it gets written up. And their membership is at risk. So they return the money and then they move on.</p></div></div></body></html>
