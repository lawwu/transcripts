We were made to consume God, eat God, drink God, be satisfied with God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We were not made primarily to contribute to God, but to receive from God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'd just like her to lay down that mindset and delight in going to the house of God to consume the feast prepared for her by the worship leaders and by the pastor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the second thing I'd say is be done with the mindset that ministry that is pleasing to the Lord is mainly church work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The church gathered exists to glorify God and equip the church for scattering to the ministries of the home and the neighborhood and the workplace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And therefore, to have a glorious ministry at home, some relationship with a few friends that you care about and minister to, is a beautiful thing for which the church exists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the second thing I would say. The third thing I would say, and this is one of the most important or, let's just say, amazing verses in the Bible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've used it often with with the people who care deeply about the nurseries of our church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is Mark 9 36. Jesus took a child. So let's just say this little autistic child.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And put him in the midst of them and taking him in his arms, he said, whoever receives one such child in my name receives me and whoever receives me receives not me, but him who sent me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, that's simply staggering. That is staggering. One child received in the name and for the glory and in reliance upon Jesus is a receiving of Jesus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then he says, no, no, it's the receiving of the creator of the universe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I would like to lift this mother's and all mothers hearts out of the mundane for a moment up into this text and say, this is a glorious thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we must allow God to tell us about the significance of what we're doing as moms and dads when there's one child that we're pouring our life into, especially a disabled child, child with special needs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One child. We are receiving Christ. We are receiving God. That's stunning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The fourth thing I'd say is that remember that life comes to us in chapters and seasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a season where the proportion of your investment in others outside the family may be smaller.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This chapter is going to change. There were other chapters once. This is the chapter now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And some chapters are very lopsided. They have to be lopsided. It's just the nature of the chapter and especially the nature of a mom with a child with special needs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Accept the chapter you're in. Be patient in it. God will bring you to another chapter in due time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that, too, will be a good a good chapter. Fifth thing I would say is you're a team with your husband.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What he does in life counts for what you're doing. You're one flesh with him. If he has any significance at all in his workplace or in the church, it's your significance as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maintaining a sweet and beautiful and satisfying and peaceful home for the children and for him is his is releasing him and you in him for significant ministry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe two more observations. Never forget that you are investing in what your children will be, not just what they are now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This season may be one that makes all the difference in their ministry 20 years from now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've known kids with autism. I had a young man come up to me a few years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't recognize him at all. And he said, his voice was kind of stilted. He was stiff. He spoke methodically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he said he was a senior at the nearby college and introduced himself. And as soon as he said his name, I just was stunned because I knew him as an eight year old autistic kid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And here he is making it. He's making it in the world. And he wanted to thank me for the church and thank me for the ministry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was clear that life is going to be hard for him. He was going to be awkward. And there are stories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if he makes it, you know why he's going to make it. Mom cared. She just poured her life into this kid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And and that's the way it is with all of our kids. So you're investing in the future, not just now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe the last thing would be you can be a praying woman and with your husband, a giving woman to the church so that your impact through prayer and giving may be beyond all reckoning at this season in your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CYdBKI7jL8&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you, Pastor John.
