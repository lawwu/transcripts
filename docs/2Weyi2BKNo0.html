now is the act of God by which, on the basis of Christ's propitiating death, he declares us righteous in union with Christ through faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He counts the punishment poured out on Christ as ours.</span></div><div

| <span class="t">He counts us righteous because of Christ, and he does this by uniting us to Christ by faith, so we speak of being justified by faith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This did not happen in A.D. 33.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It happened the instant every one of you believed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when I say that by justification joy is given once for all, I have two things in mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Listen carefully now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In the instant of justification, we experience faith uniting us to Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That faith, I would argue, has in it at least a seed of the experience of joy in Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Faith is not just a mental affirmation of the truth that Christ is Savior and Lord.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Saving faith also is the experience of Christ as our treasure, and that implies there is in this faith a sweet element of delight in him treasuring him, treasuring, owning, embracing, receiving the glory of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I also mean when I say by justification joy is given once for all, I also mean that by justification we are launched in that moment into a life indwelt by the Spirit of God whose fruit is joy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, justification is experienced once for all as the launching pad into the joy of the Holy Spirit, and that launch is by faith, which itself includes an element of joy, namely treasuring Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Third, in sanctification, joy is tasted throughout this life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you can see the difference between propitiation, justification, and glorification, because in each of those I speak of something happening once for all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Propitiation is not a process. Justification is not a process. Glorification could be seen as a process, an eternal process of ever-increasing joy from fullness to fullness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But when we are raised from the dead at Christ's return, we don't enter into a process from defect to betterment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're not always getting out of defects a thousand years after we were raised from the dead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But sanctification, beginning from the launching pad of justification, is a process of increasing holiness, goodness, righteousness, love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And right at the heart of that progressive experience is the essential reality of joy in Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I call it an essential reality in the process because it is joy in God that severs the root of sin, which is what sanctification is, and makes it possible to grow in holiness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Joy is not ancillary to sanctification. It's not an add-on to sanctification. It's an essential weapon by which we put sin to death.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hebrews 12, 2 says that Christ endured the cross, which is the most loving act that's ever been done in the history of the universe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Christ endured the cross for the joy that was set before him. In other words, Christ had tasted the fullness of the joy that lay on the other side of suffering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this taste assured him that the joy that he anticipated was worth anything to get it, including the suffering of the cross, for us to take us with him into that joy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that's exactly the way the book of Hebrews argues that we should be willing to suffer in the cause of compassion and love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul, in fact, in another place puts it like this, 2 Corinthians 8, 2, "Their abundance of joy overflowed in a wealth of generosity."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what sanctification looks like. Joy liberating us from the lies of sin and overflowing in love to people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, number four, finally, glorification. In glorification, joy is perfected once for all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Romans 8, 17 says, "If we suffer with Christ, we will be glorified with him."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Weyi2BKNo0&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Glorification is the final perfected condition when all suffering is behind us.
