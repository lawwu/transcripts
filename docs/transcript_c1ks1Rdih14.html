Two great examples this week. - I think one of my great advantages is that I have very low expectations. People with very high expectations have very low resilience and unfortunately, resilience matters in success. I don't know how to teach it to you except for I hope suffering happens to you.</p><p>- I love burning the short sellers. Like almost nothing makes a human happier than taking the lines of (beep) away from these short sellers who are going short on a truly great American company, not just ours, but I just love pulling down great American companies so that they can pay for their (beep) - It seems like a lot of people are less worried about cancel culture as they were three years ago.</p><p>People are speaking their mind more, which is positive and refreshing.</p></div></div></body></html>
