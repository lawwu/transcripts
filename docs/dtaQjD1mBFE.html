After that day's manna was up, they couldn't collect more for the following days. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaQjD1mBFE&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">they had to go back out the next day and get some new manna.

And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtaQjD1mBFE&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">another takeaway is like, even God needed rest.
