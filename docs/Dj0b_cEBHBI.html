The controlled part is the critical bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's not all that's happening right now.

And assuming you do understand my words then your brain just did something else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It activated all meanings of the word hallucination including this one. So today we rely upon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">hallucinating chatbots for brainstorming, generating content and code, and images of themselves like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But what they can't yet do is think, learn, or act in a reliable general purpose way. And we're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">satisfied with that because we've set our sights on building AI that more closely resembles our own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">intelligence. But what makes our intelligence general? Well one thing we know is that hallucinations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">are necessary because they allow us to go beyond the data. They're features rather than bugs of AI that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">flexible like ours. So we just need to figure out how to control them. I'm going to be drawing a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">parallels to our intelligence. But I'm not saying that we are or should be building something like a human</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">brain. We don't want AI to replace us or replicate us. We want it to complement us. We want AI plus humans</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to be greater than the sum of our parts. Now this isn't typically what we think about when we hear AGI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we think about the AI becoming more advanced. But this reflects a category error about how our intelligence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">actually works. And that error is that general intelligence can exist within a thinking machine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you think about AGI, you probably think about something like this. And you might think that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it's right around the corner. But why does it then feel like agents are closer to something like this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The reality is that models can't yet reliably click, type, or scroll. And so everyone wants to know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">how do we make agents reliable? That's the question that I'm going to focus on today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So first I'll share our lab's vision for agents. Then I will show you how Nova Act, which is a research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">preview of our agent works today. And then finally I'll show you how Nova Act will evolve and how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you are all central to that evolution. So let's start with the big picture. Our vision for agents is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">different than the standard vision, which reflects this long lineage of thought that has become folklore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So you all know the story by now, which is why you probably spotted the hallucination here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The concept of machines that can think like humans didn't originate in the 2010s,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but in 1956 when a group of engineers and mathematicians set out to build thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">machines so they could solve intelligence. Of course, you also all know that these guys didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">solve intelligence, but they did succeed in founding the field of AI and sparking a feedback loop that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">changed how we live and work. So first we built more powerful computers, then we connected them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">together to build the internet, which enabled more sophisticated learning algorithms. And this made our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">computers even more powerful. And now we're back to aiming for thinking machines by another name:</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI. So the standard vision is to make AI smarter and give it more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">agency. And notice that this is about the technology, not us. Well, luckily this wasn't the only historical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">perspective. Does anybody know who this is?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">This is Douglas Engelbart, and he invented the computer mouse and the GUI. He didn't care so much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">about thinking machines and solving intelligence. What he cared about was thinking humans and augmenting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">our intelligence. And he proposed that computers could make us smarter. Of course, he was absolutely right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So as computers became pervasive, they also started changing our brains. We began offloading our computation to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">devices, distributing our cognition across the digital environment, and this had the effect of augmenting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">our intelligence. Scientists call this techno-social co-evolution. It just means that we invent new technologies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that then shape us. So here we have two historical perspectives for the goal of building more advanced</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">intelligence that resembles our own. We can build AI that is as smart as or even smarter than us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or we can build AI that makes us smarter. We all believe that more general purpose agents are going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">more useful. But how? Well, things are useful when they have one of two effects. They can simplify our lives by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">allowing us to offload things, or they can give us more leverage. And yes, automation is an engine for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">augmentation. This is how we become expert at things. We start by paying conscious attention to the details,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we practice, and then our brain moves things over to our subconscious. Automation frees up our attention to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">focus on other things. The problem is that automation doesn't always lead to augmentation. Sometimes it even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">comes at a cost. How many hours have we lost to scrolling? Or how many echo chambers have we been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">trapped within? How many times has autocomplete just shut down our thinking? So this is how algorithms can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">reduce our agency. And it's how increasingly intelligent agents might cause more problems than they solve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But if we have precise control and we actively tailor these systems the way that we want, then we can actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">increase our agency. And this is the crossroads in front of us. We can continue to make AI smarter and give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it more agency. We can focus on unhobbling the AI, as it's fashionable to say. But this doesn't guarantee</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that it will be useful to us. It just guarantees that we'll continue to see a lot of the same patterns that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we've seen in tech recently. And that's why that our vision is to build AI that makes us smarter and gives</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">us more agency. To build AI that unhobbles humans. So how do we do that? Well, in these early stages,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we need to do two things. We need to meet the models where they are and meet the builders where they are. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">all of you have a million ideas about what you want to do with agents. We have to make it frictionless</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">for you to get started. And Nova Act does these two things. We're building a future where the atomic unit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of all digital interactions will be an agent call. The big obstacle is that we still only have some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">infrastructure for APIs.

And that's okay because we want them to be complementary to us. But if we're going to diverge in our computer use methods,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">then it's really critical that our agent's perception of the digital world is aligned with our own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's not what most agents can do right now.

So how will Nova Act need to evolve to make us smarter and give us more agency? In other words,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">what is it that makes our intelligence reliable and flexible and general purpose? Well, it turns out that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that over the past decades, as engineers were building more advanced intelligence, scientists were learning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">about how it works. And what they learned was that this isn't the whole story. It's just the most recent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">story of our co-evolution with technology. So computers, co-evolving with computers is this thing that we're fixated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">on. But the story goes back a lot longer, and Engelbart actually hinted at this. He said, "In a very real sense,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">as represented by the steady evolution of our augmentation means, the development of artificial</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">intelligence has been going on for centuries." Now, he was correct, but it was actually going on for a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">longer than that. So let me take you back to the beginning. Around six million years ago, the environment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">changed for our ancestors, and they had exactly two options. They could solve intelligence,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">or go extinct. And the ones that solved intelligence did so through a feedback loop that changed our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">social cognition. This should look familiar. First, our brains got bigger, then we connected them together,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">which enabled us to further fine-tune into social information, and this made our brains even bigger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But now you know that this scaling part is only half of the story. The other half had to do with how we all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">got smarter. So we offloaded our computation to each other's minds and distributed our cognition across</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the social environment. And this had the effect of augmenting our intelligence. So scientists call the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that we got better at through these flywheels representational alignment.

The key insight here is that the history of upgrading our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">intelligence didn't start with computers. It started with an evolutionary adaptation that allowed us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to use each other's minds as tools. Let me say that in another way. The thing that makes our intelligence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">general and flexible is inferring the existence of other minds. This means that this is general intelligence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">This can be general intelligence.

Intelligence of the variety that humans</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">have can't exist in a vacuum.

They didn't have great interfaces, but Engelbart changed this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Now computers are getting in our way. We've never had the world's information so easily accessible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but also we've never had more distractions. And agents can help fix this. They can do the repetitive stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">for us. They can learn from us and redistribute our skills across communities, and they can teach us new things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">when they discover new knowledge. In essence, agents can become our collective subconscious,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=1067" target="_blank">00:17:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">but we need to build them in a way that reflects this larger pattern. So collectively, these tools for thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">stabilize our thinking, reorganize our brains, and control our hallucinations. How do they control our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">hallucinations? Well, they direct our attention to the same things in the environment. They pick out the relevant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=1089" target="_blank">00:18:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">signals and the noise, and then we stabilize these signals to co-create these shared world models. And what does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that sound like? It sounds like what we're building. So another way of thinking about Nova Act is as the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">primitives for a cognitive technology that aligns agents and humans' representations. And just like with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">other cognitive technologies, early agents will need to evolve in diverse communities. So that's where all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you come in. But reliability isn't just about clicking in the same place every time. It's about understanding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=1123" target="_blank">00:18:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the larger goal. So to return to our big question: How do we make agents reliable? Eventually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">they're going to need models of our minds. So the next thing that we'll need to build is agents with models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of our minds. But we don't actually build those directly. We need to set the preconditions for them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to emerge. And this requires a common language for humans and computers. And at this point, you know what this entails.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=1148" target="_blank">00:19:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Agents will need a model of our shared environment and interfaces that support intuitive interactions with us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=1157" target="_blank">00:19:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">These will enable humans and agents to reciprocally level up one another's intelligence. To advance the models, we will need human-agent interaction data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=1167" target="_blank">00:19:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And to motivate people to use the agents in the first place, we'll need useful products. The more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=1172" target="_blank">00:19:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">useful the products become, the smarter we will all become. So this is how we can collectively build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj0b_cEBHBI&t=1178" target="_blank">00:19:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">useful general intelligence.
