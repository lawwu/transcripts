Were you ever able to build a program that beat you at chess or another board game?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">>>Stuart Russell So my program never beat me at chess. I actually wrote the program</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">at Imperial College. So I used to take the bus every Wednesday with a box of cards this big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and shove them into the card reader. And they gave us eight seconds of CPU time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It took about five seconds to read the cards in and compile the code. So we had three seconds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of CPU time, which was enough to make one move with a not very deep search. And then we would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">print that move out, and then we'd have to go to the back of the queue and wait to feed the cards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">in again. >>Lex: How deep was the search? Are we talking about one move, two moves, three moves?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">>>Stuart Russell So no, I think we got an eight move,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">depth eight with alpha beta. And we had some tricks of our own about move ordering and some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">pruning of the tree. >>Lex: But you were still able to beat that program?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">>>Stuart Russell Yeah, yeah. I was a reasonable chess player in my youth. I did an Othello program</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and a backgammon program. So when I got to Berkeley, I worked a lot on what we call meta</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">reasoning, which really means reasoning about reasoning. And in the case of a game playing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">program, you need to reason about what parts of the search tree you're actually going to explore,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">because the search tree is enormous, bigger than the number of atoms in the universe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way programs succeed and the way humans succeed is by only looking at a small fraction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of the search tree. And if you look at the right fraction, you play really well. If you look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">wrong fraction, if you waste your time thinking about things that are never going to happen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">moves that no one's ever going to make, then you're going to lose, because you won't be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to figure out the right decision. So that question of how machines can manage their own computation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">how they decide what to think about, is the meta reasoning question. We developed some methods</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">for doing that. And very simply, a machine should think about whatever thoughts are going to improve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">its decision quality. We were able to show that both for Othello, which is a standard two-player</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">game, and for Backgammon, which includes dice rolls, so it's a two-player game with uncertainty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">For both of those cases, we could come up with algorithms that were actually much more efficient</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">than the standard alpha-beta search, which chess programs at the time were using. And that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">those programs could beat me. And I think you can see the same basic ideas in AlphaGo and AlphaZero</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">today. The way they explore the tree is using a form of meta reasoning to select what to think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">about based on how useful it is to think about it. Is there any insights you can describe with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">our Greek symbols of how do we select which paths to go down? There's really two kinds of learning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">going on. So as you say, AlphaGo learns to evaluate board positions. So it can look at a go board</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and it actually has probably a superhuman ability to instantly tell how promising that situation is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">To me, the amazing thing about AlphaGo is not that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it can beat the world champion with its hands tied behind his back, but the fact that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">if you stop it from searching altogether, so you say, okay, you're not allowed to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">any thinking ahead, right? You can just consider each of your legal moves and then look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">resulting situation and evaluate it. So what we call a depth one search. So just the immediate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">outcome of your moves and decide if that's good or bad. That version of AlphaGo</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">can still play at a professional level, right? And human professionals are sitting there for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">five, 10 minutes deciding what to do. And AlphaGo in less than a second can instantly intuit what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is the right move to make based on its ability to evaluate positions. And that is remarkable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">because we don't have that level of intuition about Go. We actually have to think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the situation. So anyway, that capability that AlphaGo has is one big part of why it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">beats humans. The other big part is that it's able to look ahead 40, 50, 60 moves into the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it was considering all possibilities, 40 or 50 or 60 moves into the future, that would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">10 to the 200 possibilities. So way, way more than atoms in the universe and so on. So it's very,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">very selective about what it looks at. So let me try to give you an intuition about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">how you decide what to think about. It's a combination of two things. One is how promising</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it is. So if you're already convinced that a move is terrible, there's no point spending a lot more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">time convincing yourself that it's terrible because it's probably not going to change your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">mind. So the real reason you think is because there's some possibility of changing your mind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">about what to do. And it's that changing of mind that would result then in a better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">final action in the real world. So that's the purpose of thinking, is to improve the final</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">action in the real world. And so if you think about a move that is guaranteed to be terrible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you can convince yourself it's terrible, you're still not going to change your mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? But on the other hand, you suppose you had a choice between two moves. One of them you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">already figured out is guaranteed to be a draw, let's say. And then the other one looks a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">bit worse. Like it looks fairly likely that if you make that move, you're going to lose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's still some uncertainty about the value of that move. There's still some possibility that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it will turn out to be a win. Right? Then it's worth thinking about that. So even though it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">less promising on average than the other move, which is guaranteed to be a draw, there's still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">some purpose in thinking about it, because there's a chance that you will change your mind and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZI5oXBC0k&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">discover that in fact it's a better move.
