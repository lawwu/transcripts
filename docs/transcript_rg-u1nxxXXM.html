That parlay, huh? And it's like, "Bro, you just made me so much money. Thank you. You're my favorite player now. Da-da-da-da-da." Or it's, "Go kill yourself. I hope you tear an ACL." For real.</p><p>"I hope you never..." That's not... And it's literally like, "Bro, I hope you..." An over-exaggeration. "I hope you tear your ACL. I hope you never..." I hope you die. It's the craziest. For real. I'm looking at my DMs, I'm like, "Yo." So for a lot of people... It's part of it now.</p><p>It's a part of today's game. It's like, "Yo, I lost my apartment on you." Or after the Knicks game, I played really bad. Yeah. I've seen that. And I was like, "Ain't nobody tell you to bet your apartment on me in the first place." So it don't faze you for real.</p></div></div></body></html>
