I mentioned the AirPods earlier. I love them for everything except running. I love that these Shox headphones are open ear so you can hear things around you, cars coming, anything like that. Also, when I'm running, I really like the Nike Slim Waist Pack.</p><p>I used to use a shoulder band and then my wife got this waist pack and I was like, "Oh, that seems silly." And then I tried it. I was like, "Oh, this is much better." And so you can't see your phone while you're running, but let's be real, using your phone while it's on one of those shoulder bands while you're running is not really possible either.</p><p>I've really enjoyed switching to this. I wear it on the front. She likes it on the back, but great thing for running. Along the lines of running, the Nike Vaporfly 3 shoes are fantastic race day shoes. My speed actually improved pretty noticeably using them, but they're not everyday shoes.</p><p>And so when it came to running, I switched to the Nike Pegasus 41 shoes, which I could totally customize online.</p></div></div></body></html>
