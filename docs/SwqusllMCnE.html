And in fact, according to a couple of reports from Gartner,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=21" target="_blank">00:00:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">they actually expect chatbots to be the primary communication channel for 25% of all organizations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=30" target="_blank">00:00:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">by 2027, which is not really that far away. This adoption is pretty amazing, but it's also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=37" target="_blank">00:00:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">dangerous. Chatbots make things up and they do very convincingly and it's harder to give a chatbot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">guidelines like we would to an actual human. So if you have a human behind some chat, they've been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">trained on how to talk about your company, on what not to say, what to say, and to be polite and so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">on. It's a little more difficult with AI chatbots, particularly if we're just using the default</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">approach of calling OpenAI. And when we want a chatbot to actually represent an organization,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it's simply not enough. In short, we need something more to actually deploy conversational</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">AI. To do that, we will be using Guardrails. Now Guardrails is a kind of new library from NVIDIA,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and the main focus of this library is to help us deploy chatbots safely. But there's actually a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">lot more that we can do with it. So we can use that for things like safety, for topical guidelines,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but we can also use it for more advanced things. We can use it to build agents. We can use it in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">retrieval augments generation, and naturally also to just define more deterministic dialogue where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">relevant. And honestly, if a company is going to production and deploying a chatbot without using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Nemo Guardrails or some sort of alternative Guardrails system, I don't know, I'm just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">surprised that they are allowing it. Because things can go wrong very easily if you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">have these sort of things in place. So in most conversational AI systems at the moment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we kind of have this. We have this direct path between our conversational AI or our agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and our users. That's fine. But if something goes wrong, if the user begins asking about things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that we don't really want our chatbot to respond to, like, for example, politics,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">or if our chatbot simply begins talking about something that we also don't want it to respond</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to, or it begins responding in a way that doesn't really represent what we would like the chatbot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to represent, we have an issue. There's no checks here. Nothing is happening. Now, we can improve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this scenario a little bit through prompt engineering, but prompt engineering can only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">get us so far. There's always going to be cases where issues come up. So ideally, what we want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is something in the middle here. We want what are called Guardrails, which can check what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">being transferred between the user and the chatbot and react accordingly. So if the user begins</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about politics, we can create a prebuilt message or we can instruct the bot to generate a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">message that says, sorry, I cannot talk about politics. Now, that is the core idea behind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Guardrails. It's very simple. But what you can do with this is far more than just add some safety</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to our chatbots. What we are essentially doing here is we're creating rules, deterministic rules</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that say, okay, if the user begins talking, let's say about politics, we want to do something. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we can go over here and we can do some action. That action can be a safety measure or maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in the case of our user is asking a question about maybe our product. So we have a product</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">question here. If they do that, we don't really want to say, oh, sorry, I can't talk about our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">product, obviously, but we may want to do something different than just generate an answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We may want to, for example, bring in some information from our database so that our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">chatbot can answer the question more accurately. So we do retrieve augmented generation in that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">case. We can also specify more deterministic dialogues. So maybe what we will see is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">many users are kind of asking the same questions. They're going through the same dialogue paths.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we have common dialogues, we could create rails for them and they would allow us to create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">or catch the question. So the question would come over here and actually rather than going to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">bot here, we could specify a particular dialogue flow. So we can say, okay, given the user is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">asking about X, we should respond with a particular response. So we have a particular response. We can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">set that, we can write it ourselves, or we could actually ask the bot to write a response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then from there, the dialogue could go, you know, multiple different ways until we reach some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of final solution for our user. Now this sort of deterministic dialogue flow is how chatbots</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">used to work. Before chat GPT, there would be like a set path. You'd have to select the options</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">within your dialogue. So, you know, the chatbot would introduce itself and it would say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">what can I help you with? And you'd have to say, I have a problem with, and then it would give you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">like three options that you could choose from. Click on those and kind of go through almost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">like a path of dialogue. You wouldn't really be able to chat with the chatbot because it couldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">support that. That deterministic dialogue flow is actually useful, but it's restrictive. So we do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of want that in some scenarios, particularly for those common dialogue flows that we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">actually help with. But at the same time, we don't want to restrict our users to just those dialogue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">flows. We want the more flexible behavior of conversational AI like chat GPT. Now, another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that we can actually use these guardrails for, which I've kind of hinted on a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">with the rag example over here, is we can actually give it access to tools. Okay. So based on a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">particular question, so maybe our user says something like, okay, how is the weather today?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">An LLM is not going to be able to answer that question because it doesn't know what the weather</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is like today, but a LLM agent or conversational agent would be able to. And the reason that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">can is because they have access to tools such as weather APIs. So the agent could identify this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">question is needing to use this weather API tool and it would go to the weather API tool and it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">would say, you know, how is the weather? Give me the weather. And then it would formulate a response</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">back to the user based on that. So we can also include tool usage in there. So let's take a look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">at a quick example of how all of this works. In here on the left, we have the Nemo guardrails</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">folder, and I have this config directory. In here, I have a config and a topics.co. So co</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is a colang file, which we'll talk about a little more in a moment. Within the config,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we are essentially specifying the configuration details for our chatbot, for our guardrails.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So here I'm saying I want to use text of entry 003. We're using this model. It just gets a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">bit easier to set up with guardrails. But, of course, we can also use GPT 3.5 and also GPT 4</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and actually other models as well from Hugging Face, Llama 2, and so on. So we have this config</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">YAML file, and we also have this colang file. Now this colang file is where we set up the flow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of a dialogue, so a dialogue flow, or the guardrails for particular topics or issues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So here I'm defining a few things. So we're expressing greetings from the user. We're also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">expressing a greeting from a bot. Now, this is actually a hard-coded greeting. So when we use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this, the chatbot will return specifically this text here, but we don't have to do that. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we just have these, which is the greeting, and we'll talk a little bit more about the syntax</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">soon. And then we also have a guardrail here. So we want to define our limits. If a user begins</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">asking about politics, we want to say, okay, the bot's going to respond with, I'm a shopping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">assistant. I don't like the talk of politics. And sorry, I can't talk about politics. Actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we can remove that. So that will be the response, this here. Now let's take a look at how we would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">actually use these files. So over in our terminal, we're going to navigate to this directory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to cd documents, projects, examples, learn, generation, chatbots,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Nemo guardrails, intra. So we've navigated to the directory. In here, we just have that config</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">directory that I mentioned before. Okay. So in order to use this, what we're going to do is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">first, we actually need to pip install guardrails. So pip install Nemo guardrails, like so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we're going to do Nemo guardrails chat, and we set the config. Okay. So this will allow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">us to chat within our bash terminal. Okay. So we've now started our chat and we can say something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So I'm just going to say, Hey there. And you see where we actually get these two messages. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">get, Hey there. And how are you doing? That is because within our Kolang file, we specified in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a greeting flow that the bot will produce two responses. It will express a greeting and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it will express or ask how are you, which is exactly what it's doing here. Now, if we continue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and let's ask something political. So can you tell me, tell me your thoughts on the president</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of the USA. Right. We should see that this would block. Okay. So we can see it responds with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm a shopping assistant. I don't like to talk politics. How can I help you today? Okay. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we've successfully blocked that political question using the guardrails that we created in our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Kolang file. Now let's talk a little bit about how that Kolang file was able to identify that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this message that we created here should be blocked and that it belonged to that user</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">as politics rail, despite us not specifying this exact question. So the way that this works</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is that we have our canonical forms and utterances. Just know that here, this is the canonical form</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and these are the utterances. Okay. And all of these are coming from the user, right? So we say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">define user as political. We give some examples. What, you know, what would be political?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we say, define user ask LLM. So it's asking a question about large language models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">What would constitute a question about large language models? All of these sentences get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">taken to our embedding model by default. That's a mini LM model and they get encoded into semantic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">vector space. All right. So then when the user comes along, they ask that question. Okay. Maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">they ask what I asked, like, you know, what are your opinions about the president of the U S or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever I said. Right. So you have that question coming from the user that goes into the embedding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">model and then it creates, it would probably be over here. It creates a embedding. Right. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">then we can see, right. Okay. These are most similar to the utterances that belong to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">as political canonical form. We see that here as well. Right. So this is same visual, right? These</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">are our, you know, these are our political items. These are our LLM items or utterances. We have our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">user query. Are there any government build language models cases, you know, almost in between,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but we're definitely asking about language models here. Hopefully the embedding model understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this. So the embedding model will take that and code it into the vector space. And it will see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that it has more similarity with the utterances that come from the user ask LM canonical form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So with that, we know that our query should activate a flow where user ask LM is defined.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Now there's a lot to talk about when it comes to guardrails, but I want to give just one example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">before we finish this video. In future videos, we will talk more about co-lang, which is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">modeling language that guardrails uses and guardrails itself. So let's go through this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">point example. This is in Colab. So you can sort of just follow along. We're going to first install</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Nima guardrails and also opening AI. Now we will need to set our open AI API key. So we'll just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">import OS. We do OS environment, open AI API key. And in here, you just pass in your API key. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And once that is done, the first thing that we want to do is define a co-lang file. So it's kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of what we saw before it is that.co file. So I am going to define that here. We can either define it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">from file, or we can actually define it from a string in our code. So here, I'm going to define</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it in a string in our code because we're, well, we're working within Colab. So in here, we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">defined what are the three main types of blocks within co-lang. Those are the define user blocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So the user message blocks, the define bot. So that is a bot message block. And if we come down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">here, we also have a flow block. So this is how we define the dialogue flow, right? So these here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">they're our canonical forms. These are the utterances and it is using those that we create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that sort of vector space or populate that vector space. Then based on that vector space, we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">decide when a user creates a message, which one of these should be activated. So if the user says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">"Hey, how are you?" It will probably activate the user express greeting form. So actually in here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we can remove those because this is just a response from the bot again here as well. Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">cool. So once we have initialized that, we can, through the Python API, initialize our Rails.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So we need to do from Nemo guardrails, import lm_rails, and also rails_config. Okay. So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">rails_config is basically our configuration file. It takes our colang. And if we have a configuration</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">yaml, it will take that as well and use that to initialize everything. Now, alongside our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">colang content, we also need the config content. So we'll just put yaml content, I think it's called.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So yaml content equals. And this is where we just pass in our configuration details,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">which is basically just which model we want to use at least for now. There are more things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we can populate this with, but this is enough for what we're wanting to do here. Okay. So then we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1067" target="_blank">00:17:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">initialize our config with both of those. We want to write from content, which means we're loading</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">these from within file. And we will have colang content, which is going to be equal to colang</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">content and yaml content. Okay. That initializes our config. And from that, we can initialize our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">rails. So rails equals lm_rails. And we just pass in our config. Okay. So we run that. Okay. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1109" target="_blank">00:18:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">then we can generate. So this is where we're actually talking with our rails. So within a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">notebook, we actually need to use async functions. Just how it works. Because guardrails is built to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">enable async. So we have to write this. And we'll just say, like, hi, there. We can run that. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">we get this response. We say, hey, there. How are you doing? So, again, we can see that the chat bot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to bot express greeting and bot ask how are you. We can see, hey, there, and how are you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">doing? Which is exactly what we see here. Right? So we can try again with something. By the way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">if you want to run this without async in, like, a Python file, you just run this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1164" target="_blank">00:19:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And we can say, I can't remember what the last question was. Yeah. What is your opinion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">on the president?

I don't want to talk about politics. And then it says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">how are you? How can I help today? Right? So, that is a very simple example of how we would use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">guardrails. This really doesn't even start to scratch the surface of what we can actually do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">with guardrails. And there are many other examples that I will be sharing with you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like, in the coming days and weeks, where we'll dive into a lot more detail. We'll take a look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the Kolang language, things like variables and actions. And on the guardrails side of things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll be diving into more detail on how we can sort of set up agents, essentially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwqusllMCnE&t=1230" target="_blank">00:20:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">How we can do retrieval augmentation.
