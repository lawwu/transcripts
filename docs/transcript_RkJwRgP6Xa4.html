Like one of the things that I think is kind of weird about this memory system stuff or memory championships or something like that is people are like, "Oh, if you do these things, will you start to forget other, like, normal human stuff?" And what's weird is, like, no.</p><p>I've been doing this memory system stuff for years. I just know more stuff now. And this is aligned with the experimental literature, which seems to suggest that there's probably upper bounds, but we're not close to them. And some of these memory champions have memorized, I mean, truly absurd, you know, orders of magnitude, maybe two orders of magnitude more things than I have practiced.</p><p>Certainly people who are multilingual have really, really absurd numbers of things memorized. So there isn't, like, a resource management argument.</p></div></div></body></html>
