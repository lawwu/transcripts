But some people think that language in its modern form is not that old and might be specific to our lineage. There's been one incredibly interesting and weird line of genetic evidence that was so weird.</p><p>They identified sections of the genome that were consistently and very differently turned down or turned up in Neanderthals and modern humans, and there was a huge statistical signal that was very, very surprising, and it was the vocal tract. These changes have occurred specifically on our lineage and are absent in both the Neanderthal and Denisovan lineages.</p><p>So if you think this change in the vocal tract is important in language, then maybe that's telling you that the adaptations that humans have are ones that allow us to access a rich amount of shared knowledge and not just to rely on figuring out each thing.</p></div></div></body></html>
