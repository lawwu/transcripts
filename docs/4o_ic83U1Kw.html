target="_blank">00:01:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">key interesting ideas in this paper that I want to quickly go through in um hopefully in just uh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">give me a second let me try to see if I can actually share my entire desktop I want to quickly go through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">this uh paper in maybe about 30 45 minutes then I also want to share about um an app that I built</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that I try to show all of this with evaluation mode um labeling mode as well as optimization mode</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">um I had given Shreyya a sneak preview of this the last time um so we'll see okay now on to who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">validates the validators um so what what is this paper about so essentially this paper is about okay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone's using airline evaluators uh but the question is how are we actually going to evaluate it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">so obviously the I think that the way to do this is to label some data label some data and then match</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">how it matches against that label data and you will see that that's how that's how they try to do it as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">well um just to confirm you can actually see my screen right you can actually see the yellow and blue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">highlights okay yeah so I'm just because I'm showing the whole desktop so we'll go through a couple of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">key ideas here but the one key idea is this idea that's very interesting uh and these are scattered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">throughout in blue so firstly the observation that Shreyya and her authors made is that to grade outputs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we need to have some evaluation criteria but the process of grading outputs help us define that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">evaluation criteria so it's a chicken neck problem um across many tasks in terms of evaluation I've seen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that trying to grade the outputs without actually having seen your data actually leads to criteria</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to create criteria we've actually seen the data actually leads to criteria that's very divorced</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">from reality like people will say oh I don't want any toxicity I don't want any um spelling errors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">etc etc but the thing is well you know those are actually not problems um or they could say that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">oh you know I want to tell them to speak like how it's speaking to a friend well the thing is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">if you actually try it and you try to look at the data you realize that you actually cannot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">create that kind of create a kind of text you can't create um text that is uh it can't really return</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">slang like for example things like romanticy which is a mixture of romance and fantasy like this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of genre or like grumpy sunshine um or reverse harem so things like this is not really quite</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">part of its vocabulary it's very hard to prompt it to get it written that kind of data so so that that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">leads to undue expectations right these are expectations that just cannot be met so therefore</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">what she's proposing is that what they're saying is that it is impossible to completely determine good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">evaluation criteria without actually looking at all the outputs so essentially the point is you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to look at the data before you become evaluation criteria um unfortunately this this is not the main</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">part of the paper but it was a very key thing and I think this was actually one of the biggest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">uh aspects of the paper so essentially what what she's proposing is that okay here's the typical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">evaluation pipeline um that's right on top okay we start with uh prompting we get outputs then we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">just use some kind of evaluator lm without really checking it we just oh vipu you're not muted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">thanks thanks i took care of it yeah yeah okay so what we're seeing is that okay it's uh on the top</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that's how we're doing it right now but we're not actually um checking the alien evaluator so what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">they are proposing is that okay we put it through an alien evaluator we have some kind of candidate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">criteria and the human also does need to grade the output in terms of yes or no and then we check</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">how well the candidate criteria aligns with the human grader output and you know this is an iteration</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of the process um only once it's aligned enough and that's why they have an alignment report card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">we consider the lm evaluator as aligned and usable both in development and in production so essentially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">users iterate through the process of refining criteria and grading so that you align the lm together with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to your criteria i think there are three big there are three main problems uh when trying to use an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">lml evaluator i think the first there are two of them that we just solved one is at the end which is given</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the ideal prop can an ally evaluator achieve sufficient level of accuracy i believe the answer to this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">yes second one is how do we get humans to label a hundred to four hundred samples of data with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">sufficient high quality i think the answer to that is also solved uh essentially you just motivate them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">incentivize them the right way but the second the what's in the middle is that now that you have this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">hundred to four hundred golden samples how do you come up with some kind of prompt or some kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">input or output uh some kind of prompt or instruction or a few short samples that can actually achieve that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">ideal the ideal prompt that can align well so this part that is in the middle i think is somewhat of an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">unsolved problem at least for me uh and we see how how you try to solve this um so eval gen design</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">essentially how can we assist developers in creating evaluators</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">so even gen design how do we assist developers uh in creating evaluators to grade the element outputs right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">so essentially instead of having them to use the vibe track how can you assist them to initialize the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">l evaluator once and then we can move on so they have a workflow here i think it's useful to for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">me to just talk through this i have had the chance to actually play with this uh live and it's very nice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and a lot of it is what inspired my own uh prototype so essentially at the start you can see here there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_ic83U1Kw&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">a prop node uh where you're just writing a prompt essentially these are tweets you'll be doing name</span></div><div class="c"><span
