So, at Cartesia, we're really trying to change the paradigm of how we think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">foundation models. So, not just be like in the cloud, what you build for batch operations, but actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">how you bring it to real time, have it cover multiple modalities, and we'll be talking more about voice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">today, and have it run anywhere in the world, not just on the cloud, but on any device.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, because we're talking a little bit about voice, I want to maybe give a little bit of a prelude</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.880</a></span> | <span class="t">why it's so important to think about speed. Imagine you're having a conversation with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">person next to you, and you probably should do that after this talk, but I think the main thing is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it'd feel really awkward, right, if you were trying to talk to someone and they responded a second later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, in voice, you don't have seconds to actually give your response back, you have milliseconds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you think about voice agents, where you might be calling, you know, customer support on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">line trying to triage your problem, you're going to get pretty annoyed if it's not responding to you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and giving you accurate results as soon as possible.

So, there's so many nuances and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.260</a></span> | <span class="t">customizations that you want around voice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what we've done at Cartesia is really thought about building solutions for voice AI on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">modeling side from first principles. We care about three things. The first is quality. The naturalness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of the voice must be exquisite and something that is just table stakes for the kinds of experiences</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.140</a></span> | <span class="t">that you want to be able to deliver. The second is latency. You want to be able to hear the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">bite or the first sound of audio on the other line as soon as possible. This gives your end-to-end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">agent a lot more time to be able to do things like reason more, right, and have a little bit more slack</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.140</a></span> | <span class="t">in the end-to-end system. And third, arguably most important, is controllability. The experience that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to exude by having an agent customized for the things that you want to do is a reflection of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.780</a></span> | <span class="t">your brand. You want the agent to be able to talk about what your company is or what you're trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">sell in the way that you would. So, being able to customize the voice AI to be able to do this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.500</a></span> | <span class="t">is critical and paramount to being able to deliver a great experience to your user.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what we've done is we've pioneered a new architecture called states-based models. These are an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">alternative to transformers, and the main takeaway here is that typically transformers scale</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">quadratically, which means the longer inputs get, you get quadratic scaling in your memory as well as in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">run time. So, you know, the longer inputs, the slower your models get. With states-based models or SSMs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">generation at inference time is 0 of 1. We maintain a state that you can generate from, and this means that you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.460</a></span> | <span class="t">perfect, very low latency, things that you can't achieve with traditional transformer architectures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.460</a></span> | <span class="t">What we've pioneered is that these states-based models typically have been, you know, lower performing in the recurrent sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">compared to transformers, but we've closed that gap. And our models actually perform not just better from a latency perspective,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">but also from a quality perspective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I can give a little bit of a spiel about, you know, why this matters, but I think we're more interested in having more of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">conversation around voice AI. So, Ro, why don't you kick us off?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Definitely. So, just so you all know, this was supposed to be a fireside chat. We had some chairs and asking some good questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we're gonna open it up to the audience in a little bit. I do have a few questions for you, Arjun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You talked a little bit about latency. We hear voice AI challenges like quality and, let's say, the speed of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">models, as mentioned, the way that they're hosted on the edge, et cetera. What are the challenges that, like, your customers are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">facing? Why are you building for this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So, I think the main thing is that, you know, when you do voice AI and, you know, the main model that we have is Sonic 2, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">focused on voice generation. That's one part of the puzzle. You have to, if you're actually trying to build voice agents, you have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">hook it up with the LM, you have to hook it up with your speech-to-text model. And the biggest issue, honestly, is that there's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">enough time. You need your LM to actually have a lot of time, you know. These models aren't typically built for, you know, high or low</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">latency workflows, and so you want to actually give it the most slack. So, latency is, you know, of utmost importance there. And I can talk a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.420</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit about, you know, what we've done to create the fastest model in the world for text-to-speech. The second, I'd say, is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">controllability. So, you know, one thing that we've noticed so much is people use our platform because you're able to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">amazing quality around things like voice cloning, accents, being able to capture background noises, just so natively in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">generations that you want. You know, people think it's, like, a little bit of an uncanny valley when you're talking to an agent. It just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">sounds perfect. They like the little phone noises in the background, little beep boops, right? You know, that's kind of what you like to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.820</a></span> | <span class="t">hear, right?

Yeah. And you mentioned something interesting there, a couple of the use cases, right? Voice cloning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the control of the voices, et cetera. Can you talk a little bit about the customer use cases you're seeing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">today at Voice AI? Yeah. So, you know, Voice AI, honestly, has penetrated so much, so many markets out here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.740</a></span> | <span class="t">We look at healthcare, customer support. A lot of this is actually going into real-time gaming, right? When you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">dealing with non-player characters, you want them to be dynamic, interact, you know, with the players of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the game.

What about human narration, right? I think we hear a lot about, like, Voice AI taking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">over different types of industries or these use cases as mentioned. Do you see a place for human</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.700</a></span> | <span class="t">narrators in the future as well? Definitely, yeah. You know, creators are a huge part of the Voice AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">platform. I think one thing that I think we do a really good job of is we actually have, like, a voice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">marketplace for creators, right? You know, why is this so important? You know, our goal is not to, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">replace voice actors. Actually, it's not what I want to do at all. I think my main goal is, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">how do you give them a platform so that their, you know, their, I forgot what, like, their essence,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">right?

And so, you know, this actually gives, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">we've had a lot of voice actors on board on our platform, you know, a great way of amplifying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">them. And yeah, a lot of use cases are honestly focused on narration as well. Got it. So I have a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">more questions.

Anything about Voice AI?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Question. I fear this might be a dumb question, but I'm going to ask you. No, please. I've just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">started using Cartesia.

Awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Part of a podcast framework.

Because there's an Amazon partnership here, I was just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">wondering, like, Claw doesn't seem to work so well because of the latency. Okay. Is that, is that normal?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then one of the models that you usually pay with, and is there, is there plans for...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you repeat the question on your end, just so that... Sure, sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.980</a></span> | <span class="t">...the log thing? Yeah, yeah. So the question was, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">where you, Cartesia is integrated with PipeCat. You know, PipeCat, Cartesia, we both, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">work with AWS. But Claw, you know, still has, you know, pretty high latency when you're trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to, you know, do things end to end. So, you know, this is, you know, a huge, huge problem, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.340</a></span> | <span class="t">This is why, you know, the Slack that we give you on the TTS side is something, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">you can account for on the LM side.

You know, but a lot of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.100</a></span> | <span class="t">is actually just, you know, it's up to, you know, the LM providers often, right, to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">these optimizations. I think one thing that, you know, we're really excited about is our goal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is to, you know, make real-time AI pervasive, right? And so, you know, we're really excited</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">about if there's, like, certain applications that, you know, you're really after, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">how can we enable you to do that? So I'm happy to chat after this talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, of course. And I'll add a couple things to that, too. What's really amazing about Cartesia</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and their background is the development of custom model architectures specifically for this use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">case, which is voice AI. And we spoke a little bit about SSM and linear scaling versus quadratic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.180</a></span> | <span class="t">scaling. One thing from the AWS side and what I think is really amazing about our design philosophy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">for our generative AI ecosystem is we want customers to have optionality in our platform. And if you look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">at AWS's model gardens, we have SageMaker Jumpstart and Amazon Bedrock, these model gardens will have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.860</a></span> | <span class="t">host of different types of models for specific types of use cases. And we're on the lookout for the next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.340</a></span> | <span class="t">foundation model provider, one like Cartesia, that we can bring into our ecosystem and unlock</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.220</a></span> | <span class="t">downstream industries that might be underserved by the existing foundation models today. So that's part of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.260</a></span> | <span class="t">our strategy, part of our philosophy. And I think what, and I'll say it again, with Cartesia,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">we're really unlocking the voice AI. We need real time AI. We need, we need the ability to post on edge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">devices. And we're unlocking a lot of customers with their models. So hopefully that answers a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A little bit. A little bit. Yeah, we can chat a little bit more after. Yeah. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have some friends that are creating the video AI research and something they're kind of telling me is that in video AI, what's prevailing theory is that, you know, you don't need so much scale of the actual video data, but rather the density of information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm curious if there's something similar in voice data, whether you believe that, you know, to achieve, you know, next level models, you need, like, the next scale of data, or is it more about, like, the quality of density of that data?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's a good question. So I think the question was more around the lines of, like, you know, how does voice AI data, you know, compared to, you know, some of the other multimodal data sets in video, you know, one of the prevailing theories was that, you know, you don't actually need a lot of data, you just need it to be very rich, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, if that's the same in voice AI. I think the short answer to that is yes, but also no. I think, like, when you think about scaling for a lot of models, you know, the generative, you know, in generative AI, right, the general philosophy is like, oh, you know, large-scale pre-training data, and then you have some kind of, like, alignment data or, like, preference data that, you know, you fine-tune on typically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that holds true for a lot of other modalities as well. It actually holds true for video as well. So my background, I guess I didn't say, was, like, you know, I did my PhD in generative AI at Stanford, was working a lot on, like, image video models there as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But in audio, it's actually quite interesting because, you know, what people want from preference data is actually so diverse that it's, like, you know, you can't capture it purely by, like, a one-stage fine-tuning step.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, you definitely need very rich data. You know, you need high-quality data, of course, but you also need to pair it with information that, like, you know, many different kind of people will want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, this is how traditional LMs are trained. I think a lot of the, like, you know, large open-source, you know, image generation, video generation models also are trained this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But honestly, it just really depends on what you're trying to get after. But, yeah. Sorry, I don't know. I know that's not a satisfying answer, but, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">What's your take on the speech-to-speech model? I know Amazon has one. It seems immature, I would say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But is that the future, or, like, what's happening?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's a great question. You know, I think there are places where, like, speech-to-speech is valuable right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But I don't think it's at the point where we can actually use it for, you know, production or enterprise-grade use cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, it's great. You know, I think, you know, Amazon released the speech-to-speech model recently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I think there's a few others that are out there as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think it's still pretty clear that, like, orchestrated solutions are places that you get a lot of controllability around, like, how you want the different pieces of your system to operate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, from a latency perspective, I think speech-to-speech models will, of course, you know, dominate over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think that level of controllability is something that needs to be thought of from first principles when building these systems, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.700</a></span> | <span class="t">The goal of this system is not to build something really cute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It's to build something that actually functions for real-world use cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And we might not be there yet, but I'm sure, you know, we'll get there over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=804"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So at Cartesia, like I said, you know, we build for any device.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have models that run locally on edge devices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I think it's actually really important because, you know, I think cloud models will always be there, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.980</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there's certain size models, certain capabilities, like, you know, that you get at, like, certain sizes that you can't just, you know, get, you know, fit on, like, I don't know, very, very edge devices, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, not even, like, laptops, but, like, if you get to, like, smaller phones and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a lot of applications where, you know, edge devices are just critical, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the question becomes, like, where is a network latency plus cloud speed actually slower than edge?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've broken that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So running our models on edge are about five times faster than if you were to round trip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you get, like, just, it's, like, unparalleled latency that you get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's quite exciting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're almost up at time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll, maybe one more question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So what tools do you recommend to monitor, basically, the agent, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you're going to be the one that's going to, we're going to call you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.580</a></span> | <span

broken.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It said pause three

text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It can be the

AWS.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But, like, how do you tell us, like, hey, it's not us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not our

bring that into anything?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.700</a></span> | <span

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a good question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Evals are an incredibly important part of any system that you build.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">How do we tell you that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess you can message us and ask us if it's a problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think what we've found is, you know, typically it's at the LLM stage that we see a lot of these issues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you end up, like, you know, oftentimes there's, like, some level of formatting that you need to do for outputs that come from speech to text to make it, like, viable for your LLM and the outputs for your LLM to make it, like, you know, viable or ergonomic for your TTS to handle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But we've actually handled a lot of those edge cases for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So over time, you know, with Sonic 2, you know, I'm showing a slide here that's, like, you know, showing most on the latency side, but a lot of the capabilities and quality has also improved substantially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So not only did we get our models to be, you know, two and a half times as fast as our initial models, so we can get served at, like, 40 millisecond model latency, but a lot of those, you know, edge case issues that LMs often run into, we know that you don't want to deal with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So we deal with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">We deal with them for you to making our system more robust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Got it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So one more from me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it's 2025 now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I think five years in the future,

target="_blank">00:16:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I think in every industry that you see, you're going to have some interaction with voice AI, whether it's on the triaging side, the full N10, you know, support side, you know, gaming, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.520</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But I don't think this is the only thing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.140</a></span> | <span class="t">When you think about true interactive models, it's more than just what you can hear, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knH3fmGAteQ&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It's about how you

target="_blank">00:16:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think actually getting these to work in real time, I think, will be really exciting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
