Those are the two biggest things holding people from back from success in really entrepreneurship, but also in life. So how do you practice starting right now? 'Cause the more that you can get started and let's say you wanna do a podcast, let's put an episode out today.</p><p>I have a YouTube channel, a million subscribers. My first video that I did three years ago was with an iPhone 10 and me shirtless. Fast forward today, each video costs $20,000 to make, but I got started. The second thing is asking. Everything in life is asking, like your wife, you had to ask her to marry you.</p><p>You have to ask for a raise. You have to ask for things. And so people have a negative connotation of asking and then they have this fear of rejection. This really strong fear of, wow, I'm not good enough or they don't like me. And the beauty of asking is that you can get what you want.</p><p>If you don't ask, you can't get. People never make their million dollars 'cause they don't make their first dollar and they're not making their first dollar 'cause they don't get started. They don't realize it can be fun and you can get started today.</p></div></div></body></html>
