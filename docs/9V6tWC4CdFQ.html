a water heater, and you would get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">hot

<span class="t">And so I've always had this thing, you know, first-hand feeling of, like, how technology</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">can dramatically change, like, your life and, like, the opportunity it brings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I think if PDOOM is actually high, at some point, all of humanity is, like, aligned in making</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">sure that's not the case, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we'll actually make more progress against it, I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So the irony is, so there is a self-modulating aspect there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I think if humanity collectively puts their mind to solving a problem, whatever it is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we can get there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So because of that, I think I'm optimistic on the PDOOM scenarios.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.740</a></span> |

target="_blank">00:05:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So they would get water in these trucks, maybe eight buckets per household.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So me and my brother, sometimes my mom, we would wait in line, get that and bring it

target="_blank">00:06:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I've always had this thing, you know, first-hand feeling of, like, how technology can dramatically change, like, your life and, like, the opportunity it brings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, that was kind of a subliminal takeaway for me throughout growing up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I kind of actually observed it and felt it, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we had to convince my dad for a long time to get a VCR.</span></div><div

channel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, you can watch movies or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But this was by the time I was in 12th grade, we got a VCR.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it was a, like, a Panasonic, which we had to go to some, like, shop, which had kind of smuggled it in, I guess.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's where we bought a VCR.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But then being able to record, like, a World Cup football game and then, or, like, get bootlegged videotapes and watch movies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, all that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, you know, I had these discreet memories growing up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, it always left me with the feeling of, like, how getting access to technology drives that step change in your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think you'll ever be able to equal the first time you get hot

human history, just those plots that look at GDP across 2,000 years, and you see that exponential growth to where most of the progress happened since the Industrial Revolution.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Right, I think, like puts it in a different league, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, different league.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, I think the impact it will end up having will far surpass everything we've seen before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, obviously, with that comes a lot of important things to think and wrestle with, but I definitely think that will end up being the case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Especially if it gets to the point of where we can achieve superhuman performance on the AI research itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's a technology that may, it's an open question, but it may be able to achieve a level to where the technology itself can create itself better than it could yesterday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like the move 37 of alpha research or whatever it is, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you know, and when, yeah, you're right, when it can do novel, self-directed research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, for a long time, we'll have hopefully always humans in the loop and all that stuff, and these are complex questions to talk about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But, yes, I think the underlying technology, you know, I've said this, like, if you watched seeing AlphaGo start from scratch, be clueless, and, like, become better through the course of a day, you know, like, you know, kind of, like, kind of, like, you know, really hits you when you see that happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Even our, like, the VO3 models, if you sample the models when they were, like, 30% done and 60% done and looked at what they were generating, and you kind of see how it all comes together, it's kind of, like, I would say, it's kind of inspiring, a little bit unsettling, right, as a human.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1113" target="_blank">00:18:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, all of that is true, I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the interesting thing of the Industrial Revolution, electricity, like you mentioned, you can go back to the, again, the agricultural.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1123" target="_blank">00:18:43.540</a></span> | <span class="t">The first agricultural revolution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1124" target="_blank">00:18:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There's what's called the Neolithic package of the first agricultural revolution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't just that the nomads settled down and started planting food, but all this other kind of technology was born from that, and it's included in this package.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't one piece of technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It's, there's these ripple effects, second and third order effects that happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1148" target="_blank">00:19:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything from something silly, like, silly, profound, like pottery, it can store liquids and food, to something we kind of take for granted, but social hierarchies and political hierarchies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, early government was formed, because it turns out if humans stop moving and have some surplus food, they start coming up with, they get bored, and they start coming up with interesting systems, and then trade emerges, which turns out to be a really profound thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And, like I said, government, I mean, there's just second and third order effects from that, including that package is incredible, and probably extremely difficult, if you'll ask one of the people in the nomadic tribes to predict that, that would be impossible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1195" target="_blank">00:19:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It's difficult to predict, but all that said, what do you think are some of the early things we might see in the quote-unquote AI package?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1205" target="_blank">00:20:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, most of it, probably, we don't know today, but, like, you know, the one thing which we can tangibly start seeing now is, you know, obviously, with the coding progress, you got a sense of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to be so easy to imagine, like, thoughts in your head, translating that into things that exist, that'll be part of the package, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1226" target="_blank">00:20:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it's going to empower almost all of humanity to kind of express themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1233" target="_blank">00:20:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe in the past, you could have expressed with words, but, like, you could kind of build things into existence, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1241" target="_blank">00:20:41.800</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">You know, I've been amazed at what people have put out online with VO3, but it takes a bit of work, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1251" target="_blank">00:20:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to stitch together a set of prompts, but all this is going to get better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1255" target="_blank">00:20:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The thing I always think about, this is the worst it'll ever be, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1260" target="_blank">00:21:00.360</a></span> | <span

class="t">Yeah, it's interesting, you went there as kind of a first thought, sort of an exponential increase of access to creativity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1271" target="_blank">00:21:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Software, creation, are you creating a program, a piece of content to be shared with others, games down the line, all of that, like, just becomes infinitely more possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1285" target="_blank">00:21:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think the big thing is that it makes it accessible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.060</a></span> | <span class="t">It unlocks the cognitive capabilities of the entire 8 billion.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1293" target="_blank">00:21:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Look, think about 40 years ago, maybe in the U.S. there were five people who could do what you were doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1300" target="_blank">00:21:40.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, go do an interview, you know, but today, think about with YouTube and other products, etc., like, how many more people are doing it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think this is what technology does, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1314" target="_blank">00:21:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, when the Internet created blogs, you know, you heard from so many more people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1319" target="_blank">00:21:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1321" target="_blank">00:22:01.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But with AI, I think that number won't be in the few hundreds of thousands.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.940</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1337" target="_blank">00:22:17.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it'll change the landscape of creativity, and it makes a lot of people nervous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1341" target="_blank">00:22:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, for example, whatever,

target="_blank">00:22:30.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And YouTube and thousands of others, tens of thousands, millions of other creators can do the same kind of thing?</span></div><div

about five to ten times better than any podcast I've ever done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1366"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1369" target="_blank">00:22:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And that changes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.220</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to evolve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1371" target="_blank">00:22:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I, on the podcasting front, I'm a fan of podcasts much more than I am a fan of being a host or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1379" target="_blank">00:22:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">If

there are two AI, I think people value and choose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.020</a></span> |

say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1416" target="_blank">00:23:36.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, one way to say is, you'll have a lot more content, and so you will be listening to AI-generated content because sometimes it's efficient, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But the premium experiences you value might be a version of, like, the human

with the information, try to internalize it, combine it with the complexity of our own emotions and consciousness and all that kind of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1687" target="_blank">00:28:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But also like the responsibility of like, not, for it not to be too crazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1694" target="_blank">00:28:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's a great question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1696" target="_blank">00:28:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Look, part of, you mentioned Darren, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1698" target="_blank">00:28:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">He's a clear visionary, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1700" target="_blank">00:28:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Part of the reason we started working with him early on Vio is he's one of those people who's able to kind of see that future, get inspired by it, and kind of showing the way for how creative people can express themselves with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1718" target="_blank">00:28:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Look, I think when it comes to allowing artistic free expression, it's one of the most important values in a society, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1725" target="_blank">00:28:45.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, you know, artists have always been the ones to push boundaries, expand the frontiers of thought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1734" target="_blank">00:28:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, look, I think, I think that's going to be an important value we have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1738" target="_blank">00:28:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think we will provide tools and put it in the hands of artists for them to use and put out their work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1748" target="_blank">00:29:08.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Those APIs, I mean, I almost think of that as infrastructure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1753" target="_blank">00:29:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Just like when you provide electricity to people or something, you want them to use it and, like, you're not thinking about the use cases on top of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1760" target="_blank">00:29:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a pain brush.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1761" target="_blank">00:29:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1761" target="_blank">00:29:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, I think that's how, obviously, there have to be some things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1767" target="_blank">00:29:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, society needs to decide at a fundamental level what's okay, what's not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1771" target="_blank">00:29:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll be responsible with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1775" target="_blank">00:29:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But I do think, you know, when it comes to artistic free expression, I think that's one of those values we should work hard to defend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1783" target="_blank">00:29:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I wonder if you can comment on maybe earlier versions of Gemini were a little bit careful on the kind of things you would be willing to answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1795" target="_blank">00:29:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I just want to comment on I was really surprised and pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the fact that Gemini 2.5 Pro is a lot less careful in a good sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1805"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1811" target="_blank">00:30:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there's a lot of violence there in that history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1814" target="_blank">00:30:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a very violent history.</span></div><div

and World War II.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1818" target="_blank">00:30:18.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And earlier versions of Gemini were very, basically, this kind of sense, are you sure you want to learn about this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1826" target="_blank">00:30:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And now it's actually very factual, objective, talks about very difficult parts of human history, and does so with nuance and depth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1836" target="_blank">00:30:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's been really nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1837" target="_blank">00:30:37.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a line there that I guess Google has to kind of walk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1840" target="_blank">00:30:40.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I wonder if it's also an engineering challenge, how to do that at scale across all the weird queries that people ask.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1848" target="_blank">00:30:48.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you just speak to that challenge?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1851" target="_blank">00:30:51.020</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you allow Gemini to say, again, forgive, pardon my French, crazy shit, but not too crazy?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1859" target="_blank">00:30:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one of the good insights here has been, as the models are getting more capable, the models are really good at this stuff, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1868" target="_blank">00:31:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, I think in some ways, maybe a year ago, the models weren't fully there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1873" target="_blank">00:31:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, they would also do stupid things more often.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1875" target="_blank">00:31:15.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, you're trying to handle those edge cases, but then you make a mistake in how you handle those edge cases, and it compounds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1885" target="_blank">00:31:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think with 2.5, what we particularly found is, once the models cross a certain level of intelligence and sophistication,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1893" target="_blank">00:31:33.060</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:31:37.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think users really want that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1899" target="_blank">00:31:39.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you know, you want as much access to the raw model as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1903" target="_blank">00:31:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think it's a great area to think about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1906" target="_blank">00:31:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you know, over time, you know, we should allow more and more closer access to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1912" target="_blank">00:31:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe, obviously, let people custom prompts if they wanted to and, like, you know, experiment with it, et cetera.</span></div><div

it is, you know, from a scientific standpoint,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=1930" target="_blank">00:32:10.060</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:40:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think it'll take a bit longer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2450" target="_blank">00:40:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's amazing in the early days of Google DeepMind in 2010, they talked about a 20-year timeframe to achieve A-J-I, which is kind of fascinating to see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2462" target="_blank">00:41:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I, for me, the whole thing, seeing what Google Brain did in 2012 and when we acquired DeepMind in 2014, right close to where we are sitting in 2012, you know, Jeff Dean showed the image of when the neural networks could recognize a picture of a cat, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2481" target="_blank">00:41:21.260</a></span> |

target="_blank">00:41:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, we all talked about a couple of decades.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2489" target="_blank">00:41:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think we'll quite get there by 2030.</span></div><div class="c"><span

target="_blank">00:41:46.540</a></span> | <span class="t">We have to figure out as a society, how do we, we need some system by which we all agree that this is AI generated and we have to disclose it in a certain way, because how do you distinguish reality otherwise?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2518" target="_blank">00:41:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, there's so many interesting things you said.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2519" target="_blank">00:41:59.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So first of all, just looking back at this recent, now it feels like distant history with Google Brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2525" target="_blank">00:42:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, that was before TensorFlow, before TensorFlow was made public and open-sourced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2529" target="_blank">00:42:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So the tooling matters, too, combined with GitHub ability to share code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2534" target="_blank">00:42:14.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you have the ideas of attention, transformers, and the diffusion now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2539" target="_blank">00:42:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there might be a new idea that seems simple in retrospect, but will change everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2544" target="_blank">00:42:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that could be the post-training, the inference, time, innovations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2548" target="_blank">00:42:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think Shad Cien tweeted that Google is just one great UI from completely winning the AI race.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2555" target="_blank">00:42:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Meaning, like, UI

target="_blank">00:43:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The models can't quite express themselves in terms of the UI, too, to people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

you know, they should be able to write the best interfaces to express their ideas over time, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2626" target="_blank">00:43:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">That is an incredible idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2630" target="_blank">00:43:50.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you create a really nice agentic system that continuously improves the way you

the interface.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2642" target="_blank">00:44:02.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, of course,

very tough to organize all of humanity that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2754" target="_blank">00:45:54.180</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2762" target="_blank">00:46:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we'll actually make more progress against it, I think.</span></div><div

there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2772" target="_blank">00:46:12.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I think if humanity collectively puts their mind to solving a problem, whatever it is, I think we can get there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2778" target="_blank">00:46:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So because of that, you know, I think I'm optimistic on the P-Doom scenarios.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2787" target="_blank">00:46:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But that doesn't mean, I think the underlying risk is actually pretty high.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2791" target="_blank">00:46:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm, you know, I have a lot

target="_blank">00:46:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, as the threat becomes more concrete and real, humans do really come together and get their shit together.</span></div><div

about is probability of doom without AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2813" target="_blank">00:46:53.900</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:46:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's very possible, at least I believe so, that AI will help us become smarter, kinder to each other, more efficient.</span></div><div

would be less resource constrained, which is often the source of military conflict and tensions and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=2837" target="_blank">00:47:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So we also have to load into that, what's the P-Doom without AI?</span></div><div

about this next chapter of search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=3996" target="_blank">01:06:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">For

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4024" target="_blank">01:07:04.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4025" target="_blank">01:07:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">We should say that in the 90s, I remember the animated GIFs, banner GIFs that take you to some shady websites that have nothing to do with anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4035" target="_blank">01:07:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">AdSense revolutionized the advertisement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4037" target="_blank">01:07:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It's one of the greatest inventions in recent history because it allows us for free to have access to all these kinds of services.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4048" target="_blank">01:07:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So, ads fuel a lot of really powerful services.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4052" target="_blank">01:07:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And, at its best, it's showing you relevant ads, but also, very importantly, in a way that's not super annoying, right?</span></div><div

mode?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4067" target="_blank">01:07:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And what does that look like from a classy, not annoying perspective?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4071" target="_blank">01:07:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Two things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4072" target="_blank">01:07:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Early part of AI mode will obviously focus more on the organic experience to make sure we are getting it right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4079" target="_blank">01:07:59.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the fundamental value of ads are, it enables access to deploy the services to billions of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4087" target="_blank">01:08:07.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Second is, ads are, the reason we've always taken ads seriously is we view ads as commercial information, but it's still information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4096" target="_blank">01:08:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, we bring the same quality metrics to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4099" target="_blank">01:08:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I think with AI mode, to our earlier conversation about, I think AI itself will help us, over time, figure out, you know, the best way to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4110" target="_blank">01:08:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, given we are giving context around everything, I think it'll give us more opportunities to also explain, okay, here's some commercial information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4118" target="_blank">01:08:38.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, today, as a podcaster, you do it at certain spots, and you probably figure out what's best in your podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4127" target="_blank">01:08:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, so there are aspects of that, but I think, you know, I think the underlying need of people value commercial information, businesses are trying to connect to users, all that doesn't change in an AI moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4141" target="_blank">01:09:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But look, we will rethink it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4144" target="_blank">01:09:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You've seen us in YouTube now do a mixture of subscription and ads.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4149" target="_blank">01:09:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, obviously, you know, we are now introducing subscription offerings across everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4156" target="_blank">01:09:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, as part of that, we can optimize, the optimization point will end up being a different place as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4162" target="_blank">01:09:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you see a trajectory in the possible future where AI mode completely replaces the 10 Blue Links plus AI overview?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4171" target="_blank">01:09:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Our current plan is AI mode is going to be there as a separate tab for people who really want to experience that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4178" target="_blank">01:09:38.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's not yet at the level where our main search page is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4183" target="_blank">01:09:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But as features work, we'll keep migrating it to the main page.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4188" target="_blank">01:09:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you can view it as a continuum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4191" target="_blank">01:09:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">AI mode will offer you the bleeding-edge experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4194" target="_blank">01:09:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But it thinks that work will keep overflowing to AI overviews in the main experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4201" target="_blank">01:10:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And the idea that AI mode will still take you to the web, to the human-created web.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4206" target="_blank">01:10:06.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, that's going to be a core design principle for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4208" target="_blank">01:10:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, really, if users decide, right, they drive this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4211" target="_blank">01:10:11.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

class="t">And as you move to AI mode, I mean, it's just a different experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4234" target="_blank">01:10:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I think Liz was talking about, I think you've mentioned that you ask more questions, you ask longer questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4241" target="_blank">01:10:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Dramatically different types of questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4243" target="_blank">01:10:43.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

larger number of questions of this black box machine, let's say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4254" target="_blank">01:10:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And with AI overview, it's interesting because I still value the human, I still ultimately want to end up on the human-created web.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4266" target="_blank">01:11:06.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But, like you said, the context really helps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4269" target="_blank">01:11:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It helps us deliver

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4284" target="_blank">01:11:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It makes the humans that create the web nervous.</span></div><div

target="_blank">01:11:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, I think making sure that ecosystem, in fact, I think we'll be able to differentiate ourselves as a company over time because of our commitment there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4316" target="_blank">01:11:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's something I

class="t">And as we are designing, we'll continue prioritizing approaches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4324" target="_blank">01:12:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm sure for the people who want, they can have a fine-tuned AI model that's clickbait hit pieces that will replace current journalism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4333" target="_blank">01:12:13.340</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a shot of journalism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4335" target="_blank">01:12:15.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Forgive

for really strong criticism of things, that Gemini is very good at providing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4343" target="_blank">01:12:23.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4344"

target="_blank">01:12:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">For now, I mean, people are concerned that there will be bias that's introduced that as the AI systems become more and more powerful, there's incentive from sponsors to roll in and try to control the output of the AI models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4361" target="_blank">01:12:41.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But for now, the objective criticism that's provided is way better than journalism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4365" target="_blank">01:12:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course, the argument is the journalists are still valuable.</span></div><div

that we get on the open internet is also very, very powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4376" target="_blank">01:12:56.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like they're all super important things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4384" target="_blank">01:13:04.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But I feel like there is real value for high-quality journalism, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4390" target="_blank">01:13:10.600</a></span> | <span

sources you read online.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4408" target="_blank">01:13:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think both end up playing a super important role.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4411" target="_blank">01:13:31.260</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:13:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Demis talked about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4416" target="_blank">01:13:36.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It's sort of the slice of the web that will increasingly become about providing information for agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4423" target="_blank">01:13:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can think about it as, like, two layers of the web.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4426" target="_blank">01:13:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">One is for humans, one is for

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4445" target="_blank">01:14:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Or will it all be agents in the end?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4448" target="_blank">01:14:08.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Today, like, not everyone does, but, you know, you go to a big retail store, you love walking the aisle, you love shopping.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4459" target="_blank">01:14:19.340</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4470" target="_blank">01:14:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So I do feel like over time, websites will also get better for

on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4580" target="_blank">01:16:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So can you tell me the story of

dynamic time, you know, around 2004, 2005, with Ajax, the web suddenly becoming dynamic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4600" target="_blank">01:16:40.340</a></span> | <span class="t">In a matter of few months, Flickr, Gmail, Google Maps, all kind of came into existence, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4609" target="_blank">01:16:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Like the fact that you have an interactive dynamic web, the web was evolving from simple text pages, simple HTML to rich dynamic applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4620" target="_blank">01:17:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But at the same time, you could see the browser was never meant for that world, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4627" target="_blank">01:17:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Like JavaScript execution was super slow, you know, the browser was far away from being an operating system for that rich, modern web, which is coming into place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4640" target="_blank">01:17:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the opportunity we saw.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4642" target="_blank">01:17:22.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you know, it's an amazing early team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

for building a browser, like we wanted to bring core OS principles into the browser, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4664" target="_blank">01:17:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, so we built a secure browser sandbox.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4668" target="_blank">01:17:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Each tab was its own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

unique.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4675" target="_blank">01:17:55.340</a></span> | <span class="t">We found an amazing team in Aarhus, Denmark, with a leader who built a V8, the JavaScript VM, which at the time was 25 times faster than any other JavaScript VM out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4689" target="_blank">01:18:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, you're right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4690" target="_blank">01:18:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We open sourced it all and, you know, and put it in Chromium too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4694" target="_blank">01:18:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But we really thought the web could work much better, you know, much faster, and you could be much safer browsing the web.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4703" target="_blank">01:18:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And the name Chrome came was because we literally felt people were like the Chrome of the browser was getting clunkier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4712" target="_blank">01:18:32.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We wanted to minimize it.</span></div><div

project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4716" target="_blank">01:18:36.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Definitely, obviously, highly biased person here talking about Chrome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4722" target="_blank">01:18:42.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, it's the most fun I've had building a product from the ground up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4727" target="_blank">01:18:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, it was an extraordinary team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4731" target="_blank">01:18:51.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I had my co-founders on the project were terrific, so definitely fond memories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4735" target="_blank">01:18:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So for people who don't know, Sundar, it's probably fair to say you're the reason we have Chrome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4741" target="_blank">01:19:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, I know there's a lot of incredible engineers, but pushing for it inside a company that probably was opposing it because it's a crazy idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4748" target="_blank">01:19:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Because as everybody probably knows, it's incredibly difficult to build a browser.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4753" target="_blank">01:19:13.520</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4758" target="_blank">01:19:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">He kind of firsthand knew what a crazy thing it is to go build a

like, this is, you know, there was a crazy aspect to actually wanting to go build a browser.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4769" target="_blank">01:19:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But he was very supportive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4773" target="_blank">01:19:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, everyone, the founders were.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4776" target="_blank">01:19:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I think once we started, you know, building something and we could use it and see how much better from then on, like, you know, you're really tinkering with the product and making it better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4785" target="_blank">01:19:45.980</a></span> | <span

early on, which is, you know, their whole feeling around working on moonshots, like, as a way, when you work on something very ambitious, first of all, it attracts the best people.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4886" target="_blank">01:21:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's for, for a long time, Waymo has been just, like you mentioned with scuba

look like, I mean, we always say, right, the first 80% is easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4928"

target="_blank">01:22:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we definitely were working through that phase with Waymo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4936" target="_blank">01:22:16.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But I was aware of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4938" target="_blank">01:22:18.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So, but, you know, we knew we were at that stage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4940" target="_blank">01:22:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">We knew we were the technology gap between, while there were many people, many other self-driving companies, we knew the technology gap was there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4951" target="_blank">01:22:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, right at the moment when others were doubting Waymo is when, I don't know, I made the decision to invest more in Waymo, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4960" target="_blank">01:22:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Because so, so in some ways, it's counterintuitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4965" target="_blank">01:22:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think, look, we've always been a deep technology company and, like, you know, Waymo is a version of kind of building a AI robot that works well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=4975" target="_blank">01:22:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we get attracted to problems like that, the caliber of the teams there, you

you follow the space super closely, you know, I'm talking to someone who knows the space well, but it was very obvious it's going to get there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

getting really good at programming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5456" target="_blank">01:30:56.960</a></span> | <span

more code is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5475" target="_blank">01:31:15.460</a></span> | <span class="t">written by

Google, you know, we've given various stats around like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5485" target="_blank">01:31:25.720</a></span>

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5491" target="_blank">01:31:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But the most important metric, and we carefully measure it, is like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5495" target="_blank">01:31:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">how much has our engineering

<span class="t">And it's like tough to measure, and we kind of rigorously try to measure it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5506" target="_blank">01:31:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And our estimates are that number is now at 10%, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

using AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5520" target="_blank">01:32:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But we plan to hire

target="_blank">01:32:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think hopefully, you know, at least in the near to midterm, for many engineers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5543" target="_blank">01:32:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">it frees up more and more of the, you know, even in engineering and coding, there are aspects</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5551" target="_blank">01:32:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which are so much fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5552" target="_blank">01:32:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">You're designing, you're

target="_blank">01:32:40.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But it hopefully takes a lot of that away, makes it even more fun to code, frees you up more time to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5567" target="_blank">01:32:47.220</a></span> | <span class="t">create, problem solve, brainstorm with your fellow colleagues, and so on, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5572" target="_blank">01:32:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the opportunity there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5575" target="_blank">01:32:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And second, I think, like, you

target="_blank">01:33:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">which means people will create more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5585" target="_blank">01:33:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That means there'll be more engineers doing more things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5588" target="_blank">01:33:08.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's tough to fully predict.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5590" target="_blank">01:33:10.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, I think in general, in this moment, it feels like, you know, people adopt these tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=5599" target="_blank">01:33:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and be better

the world's information accessible allows our curiosity to be satiated some with AI even more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6374" target="_blank">01:46:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We can be more and more curious and learn more about the world, about ourselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6378" target="_blank">01:46:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so doing, I always wonder if, I don't know if you can comment on like, is it possible to measure the, not the GDP productivity increase, like we talked about, but maybe whatever that increases, the breadth and depth of human knowledge that Google has unlocked with Google search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6401" target="_blank">01:46:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And now with AI mode, with Gemini is a difficult thing to measure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6407" target="_blank">01:46:47.760</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:46:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">They just estimated the impact of Google search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6415" target="_blank">01:46:55.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And they basically said, it's the equivalent to, on a per person basis, it's a few thousands of dollars per year per person, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6423" target="_blank">01:47:03.060</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:47:07.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and, but it's, yeah, it's tough to capture these things, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6431" target="_blank">01:47:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You kind of take it, take it for granted as these things come.</span></div><div

do you measure the value of something like alpha fold over time, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6443" target="_blank">01:47:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and, and, and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6444"

target="_blank">01:47:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And also the increase in quality of life when you learn more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6447" target="_blank">01:47:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I have to say like with some of the programming I do done by AI, for some reason, I'm more excited to program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V6tWC4CdFQ&t=6455" target="_blank">01:47:35.920</a></span> | <span
