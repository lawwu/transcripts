Is there a more important question for each of us to answer? I don't think there is. So how do we find a satisfying answer, especially in a world that tells us we are good enough or special enough to warrant God's eternal favor?</p><p>And in a world full of religions that say we can save ourselves? Everyone has an answer to how God can become 100% for you. But how does God himself answer the question in his holy word? Pastor John explained in a 2017 chapel message. Here he is. How do you get into this position?</p><p>Who's he talking about? How do you get into the position where God is 100% for you and not against you? How do you get in there? I want in there! I want to be in that paradise! How do you get into the position where God is 100% for you and not ever at all against you?</p><p>The answer of the New Testament is by faith alone. Now follow me. You need to be able to stand on this with all your might because of the accusations. Follow me. Romans 328. We hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law. I think works of the law here and usually means any effort at law keeping.</p><p>Which does imply that Luther at least by way of interpretation got it right when he translated one is justified by faith alone apart from works of the law. I think that is implied there. But it doesn't say it. Let's look at another text. Philippians 3.9. Paul aims to be found "in Christ" that's crucial.</p><p>Not having a righteousness of my own that comes from law. Law keeping. But a righteousness which comes through faith in Christ. The righteousness from God that depends on faith. So again he is denying and affirming. He denies that the righteousness he needs in the presence of God is his own.</p><p>That comes from law. And he affirms that the righteousness he needs in the presence of God is in Christ. In union with Christ. Which comes through faith in Christ. The righteousness from God that depends on faith. So again not law keeping but faith implies faith alone. It gets clearer.</p><p>Galatians chapter 2. Chapter 2 verse 21. I do not nullify the grace of God for if righteousness were through law Christ died to no purpose. So the righteousness we need before God is not through law. Not through law keeping. Now maybe though it means not completely through law keeping.</p><p>Maybe this is room for a little bit. Maybe it's really salvation by faith. It's just a little bit. A little bit of law keeping. Like maybe just circumcision. That's not much. The most radical statement on this is Galatians 5 verses 1 to 3. For freedom Christ has set us free.</p><p>Stand firm therefore and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery. Look. I Paul say to you that if you accept circumcision. Just one little effort at law keeping. If you accept circumcision. If you add that one little effort in addition to faith in Christ. Christ is no advantage to you.</p><p>That's wildly radical. I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision. He is obligated to keep the whole law. So if you choose to rely just a little bit on law keeping as a way of getting justified. As a way of getting into a position where God is 100% for you.</p><p>Christ is of no advantage to you. If you go the route of justification by faith plus a little bit of law keeping. You go the route of justification by total law keeping. All or nothing. Verse 3 again. I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision. He is obligated to keep the whole law.</p><p>There are two ways of justification. The way of law keeping which requires your perfection. And the way of faith which depends on Christ's perfection. These two paths into the place where God is 100% for you are so distinct. They cannot be mixed at all. If you are trusting Christ for a righteous standing.</p><p>Where God is 100% for you. You cannot mix one quiver of effort to establish your own righteousness. And if you are seeking to establish your own righteousness. Your own record of virtue. As an entrance into the position where God is 100% for you. You cannot mix the slightest faith in Christ as your all sufficient righteousness.</p><p>They are mutually exclusive. That's solid. We need that reminder often. That was John Piper in a chapel message at Bethlehem College and Seminary on September 13th, 2017. It's titled, "Faith Alone. How Not to Use a Reformed Slogan." You can find the entire address at DesiringGod.org. And if you have a favorite sermon clip of Pastor John in a recent sermon or an old message.</p><p>Send it to us. Email it in to me. Mention the time stamps from the audio clip of when it begins and ends. Or any clip that has most impacted your life. And email all that information in to me at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org. That's AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org. Put the word "clip" in the subject line as well if you would.</p><p>I'm always interested to hear your favorite clips. I'm Tony Reinke and Pastor John is back with us in studio on Friday. We'll see you then.</p></div></div></body></html>
