It sounds like that. But I'm sure that's not what Paul means there, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll try to show why. I think it's really plain from two passages of Scripture that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Paul was certain that when he and other believers died, they would go immediately to be with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the Lord Jesus and see him in that moment. And here are those two passages, 2 Corinthians</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">5, 6-9. "We are always of good courage. We know that while we are at home in the body,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.020</a></span> | <span class="t">we are away from the Lord. We walk by faith, not by sight. Yes, we are of good courage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord." Those are the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">two alternatives that Paul sees. I'm either here in my body, in one sense, away from at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">homeness with the Lord, or I die and I'm at home with the Lord. Now here's verse 9. "So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">whether we are at home or away, whether we're with him or here, we make it our aim to please</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">him." Now, Paul did not conceive of a time when the body dies and we are not at home</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.180</a></span> | <span class="t">with the Lord. To die is to lose the body temporarily and go to be at home with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Lord. This is not his first choice. I mean, that's one of the things we might correct</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">at funerals, is not to give the impression that he disembodied at homeness with the Lord</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is the first apostolic choice. His first choice is, "Oh, that the Lord Jesus would come before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I die and overclothe my body with eternal life." But, he says, if we die, it was better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So his third choice is, "Stay here and work." His second choice is, "Go to be with Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">without my body." His first choice is, "Come, Lord Jesus, and give me a new body so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I never have to be bodiless." The other passage is Philippians 1:22, "If I am to live in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet, which I shall choose, I cannot tell. I'm hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account." Now, those are the two possibilities</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">for Paul, and one of them was not to die and have the soul lie in the grave sleeping. That</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">wasn't the choice. Die and have the soul lie in the grave sleeping until the second coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">No. The two possibilities were, go on living here, or go to be with Christ, which is far,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">far better. So I conclude Paul had no doubts about being united with Christ with conscious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">joy, by faith, in this life, and it would never be interrupted by death, and when he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">left his body, when he was martyred, he would go to something far better than even the communion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that he enjoyed with Christ here. Now, let's say a word about 1 Thessalonians 4. And here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you've got to put on your thinking cap, because I'm sorry, the logic of this text is so important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's clear, but it's complicated. It goes like this. "Since we believe," this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is 1 Thessalonians 4, we'll start at verse 14, "since we believe that Christ died and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">rose again, even so through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that sounds like he means to bring them with him from heaven, where in fact they are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, there are souls in heaven. We just argued for that from 2 Corinthians 5:8 and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Philippians 1. Now, verse 15, "For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.680</a></span> | <span class="t">fallen asleep." Now that, too, might sound like we are already in our souls, body in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the grave, souls with Jesus in the presence of the Lord, and in that sense, those still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">on earth have not preceded them into the presence of Christ. But here's the problem. Now comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the argument, the argument for why those who are left, who are alive, will not precede</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">those who have died. It goes like this, verse 16, "For because," we won't precede them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">"because the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of the archangel and with the sound of the trumpet, and the dead in Christ will rise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">first." That's why we won't precede them. They rise, they rise first. "Then we who are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.080</a></span> | <span class="t">alive, who are left, will be caught up together," not a first and second, "together with them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord." So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the argument for why those who are alive at the Lord's coming will not precede those who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">have died is that those who have died will rise first. Then we will all go together,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">no ranking, "Oh, you got to go first," together to meet the Lord in the air.

So here's my conclusion when I put these three passages together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Precede in 1 Thessalonians 4:15 does not refer to the dead preceding the living into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">presence of the Lord in heaven, which of course they clearly do.

Let me say that again, because that's what the argument</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvnGL1FCAWY&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of verses 16 and 17 demands that precede means.
