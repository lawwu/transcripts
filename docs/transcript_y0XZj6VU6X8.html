Let's not have any corporate PAC money or any PAC money, any lobbyists. Let's have term limits for Supreme Court justices. Let's ban stock trading and also ban Members of Congress from becoming lobbyists. This was common sense things. And I think people are so starved for restoring trust.</p><p>Now, here is the honest truth in my view. Most Members of Congress, of the 435, at least 300 to 350 have good motives going in. They want to do the right thing, they may disagree. But we're in a situation where we have lost the trust of the American people.</p><p>Most Americans think Members of Congress are lying, they think they're corrupt, they think they're self-serving. I don't care that we have good intentions. That's the perception. We've got to take some bold steps to clean up the system so we can do these big projects of rebuilding the country.</p></div></div></body></html>
