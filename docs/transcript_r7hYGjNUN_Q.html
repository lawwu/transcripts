Know These Airport Rules</h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7hYGjNUN_Q" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r7hYGjNUN_Q/maxresdefault.jpg" style="width:50%;"></a><div><br></div><h3>Transcript</h3><div class='max-width'><p>There are a lot of countries where whether it's immigration or security, if you're with a family, they treat you much better. Yes, unfortunately, they definitely don't do that in the U.S. because they don't want to. Everyone here is equal. But yeah, in other countries, I've seen it where there's actually separate immigration lines.</p><p>Now, this can play to your disadvantage sometimes too when you fly into the Rome airport, right? If you're a U.S. citizen with a U.S. passport that has one of those little chips in it, you can go through basically a biometric entry gate and get into the country faster. But if you're with children 18 and younger, you can't.</p><p>So families are actually penalized in that case when you're arriving in Italy. In Mexico, we've often been pulled out of the line and said, hey, you have kids. Don't wait in this line. Go this way. I'm right through. Yes. Excellent. And it helps to sort of get the eye of somebody who's minding the security line or the immigration line and make sure that they're aware that you have children with you and they're crying maybe or, you know, you nudge them a little bit, right?</p><p>Now, there are family lanes that offer security and sometimes immigration as well in certain countries. Again, I would be on the lookout for them the moment you get to the airport. They're not always well signposted, but they'll usually have a little family icon with a stroller and a couple parents and children in tow.</p></div></div></body></html>
