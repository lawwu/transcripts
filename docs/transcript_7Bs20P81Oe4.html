Depending on what exactly you define Stripe as being, I think conceivably decades earlier, in that, I mean, on some level PayPal is a kind of Stripe. And there were many payments companies before PayPal.</p><p>Mostly my story of Stripe is one of market inefficiency. And I do wonder, yeah, why much of this didn't happen sooner? I always find it really interesting when there's these cases where it wasn't even the case that, like, well, it could have been started sooner, but there was nobody in the market.</p><p>There were like many people in the market and they weren't just like random people. There were technology companies headquartered in San Francisco who were in the market. Do you have some explanation for why it didn't occur to them? I'm hesitant to generalize too much because, well, I only have maybe, you know, n equals one experience.</p><p>And so I think it's dangerous to over-extrapolate from that. I guess my general view is most products and most businesses, things can just be done much better. And I think moats are typically kind of overrated. And I mean, the payments are a great example of a domain where on a logical basis, you would say that there are so many sources of defensibility where there's the network effect of the account holders, and there's the data network effect slash economy of scale, you know, for fraud and so forth.</p><p>And there are regulatory moats and barriers, you know, and, and, and, and yet, you know, not only does Stripe exist, but there are lots of other, I mean, there's a whole fintech ecosystem today, right? It's just not that useful to build financial ecosystems that are self-contained, right? A financial island is not that helpful.</p><p>And this has been Stripe's strategy very deliberately from the beginning where, you know, there were lots of companies when Stripe started out that were trying to sort of do their own thing and go their own way. Whereas our belief was you got these, I mean, it's classic, I guess, Metcalfe law stuff of, you know, by enhancing the capabilities of an existing ecosystem, you create quite a bit more value.</p><p>When Stripe started out, Stripe seemed like it definitely wasn't cool. It was, it was sort of the opposite for just a couple of us. And we thought that we could make this the superior payments API. And for the vast majority of its history, Stripe has, I think, attracted people who are drawn to unglamorous infrastructure challenges and problems.</p><p>We have a very good understanding of our domain and a set of people who actually care about solving the problems and who are, I don't know, continually paranoid at the prospect that we might be forgetting something important and sort of trying to figure out what the thing that could supplant Stripe's approaches is and making sure that we build those first.</p><p>In our discussions internally, a lot of it, and probably the significant majority of it, is still about, okay, where are there actual practical shortcomings and limitations in even our core bread and butter? The adoption of these practices in like really kind of tenacious, like multi-year form is, yeah, just yields really high returns.</p><p>And there may be other organizations that like both ship at that rate and kind of maintain that sort of developer velocity at this kind of combination of scale and reliability and security. But I don't think there were that many. And I think it's a real testament to, yeah, the remarkable folks at Stripe who made it happen.</p><p>The best people, you know, consider themselves craftspeople in their domain, and they really, above almost all else, want to work with the best other people. And so I think it's very hard to assemble groups of the best people if you don't take the practice of the work super seriously.</p><p>I mean, maybe kind of a theme through everything we've talked about is actually taking the goal seriously. And I feel like a lot of what we do at Stripe is, again, I disdain any sort of genius in it. I think it's just the very earnest, repeated, serious, and long-term application of taking the goal seriously.</p></div></div></body></html>
