We wanted a house where we could have people come and visit, family and friends who'd come and stay with us. I said, I wanted to surf more. I had all this stuff we wanted to do as a couple and it wasn't five years later.</p><p>We did it like nine months later. Cause as soon as we defined what was possible and we had a goal, all of a sudden I was like, well, hey, you want to go to Hawaii for a couple of months this winter while it's miserable and rainy in the Pacific Northwest?</p><p>Sure. So we went there and because we knew we wanted to end up there someday, we started looking at real estate and all of a sudden we found a house, right? Is that law of attraction? I mean, is that wooboo stuff or is that we had a vision for where we wanted to go and we worked towards it.</p><p>So we do that in our marriage. We set goals together every year. We visit them every quarter. I have a sheet hung up on my bathroom mirror that has our goals for the year, as well as spots for checking off, just being intentional, doing the things that we do in business and applying them to our personal life that has made such a difference on the relationship side.</p></div></div></body></html>
