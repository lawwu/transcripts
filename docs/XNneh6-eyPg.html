This is probably, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to know how to do GraphRack, Michael's quick deep dive on this is the best introduction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you can get.

That's good going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So, the case for GraphRack is where we are going to start. And the challenge with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">using LLMs and using other patterns for this is basically they don't have the enterprise domain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge. They don't verify or explain the answers. They are subject to hallucinations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And they have ethical and data bias concerns. And you can see that very much like our friendly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">parrot here. They are all the things which parrots behave and act like, except a cute bird.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we want to do better than this with GraphRack and figure out how we can use domain-specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge, accurate, contextual, and explainable answers. And really, I think what a lot of companies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and what the industry is figuring out is it's really a data problem. You need good data. You need to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">data you can power your system with. One of the patterns you can do this with is RAG. So, you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">stick your external data into a RAG system. You can get stuff back from a database for the pattern.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But vector databases and RAG fall short because it's lacking kind of your full data set. It's only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">pulling back a fraction of the information by vector-similar algorithms. Typically, a lot of the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.280</a></span> | <span class="t">especially modern vector databases, which everyone's using, they're easy to start with, but they're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">robust. They're not mature. They're not something which has scalability and fallback and gives you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that, what you need to get into, build a strong, robust enterprise system. And vector similarity is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the same as relevance. So, results you get back from using a basic RAG system. They give you back things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">which are related to the topic, but it's not complete, and it's typically also not very relevant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it's very hard to explain what's coming out of the system. So, we need to answer. Lifeline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Graphrag. And what Graphrag is, is we're bringing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the knowledge and the context and the environment to what LLMs are good at. So, you can think of this kind of like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the human brain. Our left brain is, our right brain is more creative. It does more like building things. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">does more extrapolation of information. Whereas our left brain is the logical part. That's what actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">has reasoning, has facts, and can enrich data. And it's built off of knowledge graphs. So, a knowledge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">graph is a collection of nodes, relationships, and properties. Here's a really simple example of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge graph where you have two people. They live together. You have a car. But when you look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">into the details, it's actually like a little bit more complex than it seems at first, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">they both have a car, but the owner of the car is not the person who drives it. This is kind of like my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">family. My wife does all the bills, but then she hands me the keys whenever we get on the freeway. She</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">hates driving. So, knowledge graphs also are a great way of getting really rich data. Here's an example of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the stack overflow graph built into a knowledge graph where you can see all of the rich metadata and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">complexity of the results. And we can use this to evolve RAG into a more complex system, basically graph RAG,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">where we get better relevancy. We're getting more relevant results. We get more context, because now we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">actually pull back all of the related information by graph closeness algorithms. We can explain what's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">on because it's no longer just vectors, it's no longer statistical probabilities coming out of a vector</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">database. We actually have nodes, we have structure, we have semantics we can look at, and we can add in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">security and role-based access on top of this. So, it's context-rich, it's grounded. This gives us a lot of power, and it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">gives us the ability to start explaining what we're doing, where now we can visualize it, we can analyze it, and we can log all of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this is one of the initial papers, the graph RAG paper from Microsoft Research, where they went</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">through this and they showed that you could actually get not only better results, but less token costs. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">was actually less expensive to do a graph RAG algorithm. There have been a lot of papers since then, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">show all of the different research and interesting work which is going on in the graph RAG area. This is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">just a quick view of the different studies and results which are coming out, but even from the early</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Data.World study, where they showed a three-times improvement in graph RAG capabilities, and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">analysts are even showing how graph RAG is trending up.

So, a lot of great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">reports from Gartner showing that it's grounded in facts, it resolves hallucinations, together knowledge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">graphs and AI are solving these problems, and it's getting a lot of adoption by different industry leaders,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">by big organizations who are taking advantage of this and actually producing production applications</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and making it work like LinkedIn customer support, where they actually wrote this great research paper,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">where they showed that using a knowledge graph for customer support scenarios actually gave them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">better results and allowed them to improve the quality and reduce the response time for getting back to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">customers.

I mentioned the data.world study,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">which basically was a comparison of doing RAG on SQL versus RAG on graph databases, and they showed a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">three-times improvement in accuracy of LLM responses. And let's chat about patterns, Michael,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.520</a></span> | <span class="t">because I think everyone's here to learn how to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly. So, let's look at how to do this, actually, right? So, and if you look at GraphREG,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">there are actually two sides to the coin. So, one, of course, you don't start in a vacuum,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to create your knowledge graph, right? So, NVC, basically, multiple steps to get there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Initially, you get unstructured information, you substructure it, you put it into a lexical graph,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">which represents documents, chunks, and their relationships. And a second step, you can then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">extract entities using, for instance, LLMs with this graph schema to extract entities and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">their relationships from that graph. And in a third phase, you would enrich this graph, for instance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">with graph algorithms, doing things like, you know, page rank, community summarization, and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when you have this build-up knowledge graph, then you do GraphREG as the search mechanism,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">either with local search or global search and other ways, right? So, let's first look at the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">phase of, like, knowledge graph construction a little bit. So, like, always in data engineering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">there is, if you want to have higher quality outputs, you have to put in more effort at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">beginning, right? So, it's basically nothing comes for free, there's no free lunch after all. But what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you do at the beginning is basically paying off multiple times, because what you get out of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">unstructured documents is actually high quality, high structured information, which you then can use to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">extract contextual information for your queries, which allows to reach retrieval at the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, after seeing GraphREG being used by a number of users, customers, we've seen, we looked at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">research papers, we saw that a number of patterns emerging in terms of, like, how we structure our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">graphs, how we query these graphs, and so on. And so, we started to collect these patterns and put them on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">GraphREG.com. And we want to, I wanted to show what this looks like. So, we have, basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">example graphs in the pattern, the pattern has a name, description, context, and we see also queries</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that are used for extracting this information, right? So, for instance, here's a mix of a lexical graph and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">then domain graph, and then we can have the query that fetches this information. Let's look at the three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">steps in a little bit more detail on the graph model side. So, on one side, we have for lexical graphs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you represent documents and the elements. So, that could be something simple as a chunk. But if you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">structured elements and documents, you can also do something like, okay, I have a book, which has chapters,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.520</a></span> | <span class="t">which have sections, which have paragraphs, where the paragraph is the semantically cohesive unit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that you would use to, for instance, create a vector embedding of that you can use later for vector search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But what's really interesting in the graph is, basically, you can connect these things all up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So, you know exactly who's the predecessor, who's the successor to a chunk, who's the parent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of an element, and using something like vector or text similarity, you can also connect these chunks as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">well by a neighbor or similarity graph, where you basically store similarities between chunks, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you put on the relationship between them and weighted score, basically, how similarity to chunks. And then you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">can use all these relationships when you extract the context and the retrieval phase to, for instance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">find what are related chunks by document, by a temporal sequence, by a similarity and other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So, that's only on the lexical side. This looks like this. So, for instance, you have an RFP,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and you want to break it up in a structured way, then you basically create the relationships between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">these chunks, these chunks, or these subsections, edit text, do the vector embeddings, and then you do it at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">scale, and then you get a full lexical graph out of that. Next phase is entity extraction, which is also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">something that has been around for quite some time with NLP, but LLMs actually take this to the next level</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">with their multi-language understanding, with their high flexibility, good language skills for extraction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you basically provide a graph schema and an instruction prompt to the LLM plus your pieces of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">information, pieces of text. Now, with large context windows, you can then put in 10,000 tokens for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">extraction. If you have, you can also put in already existing ground tools. So, for instance, if you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">existing structure data where your entities, let's say products, or genes, or partners, or clients are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">already existing, then you can also pass this in as part of the prompt, so that the LLM doesn't do an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">extraction, but more an recognition and finding approach where you find your entities, and then you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">extract relationships from them, and then you can store additional facts and additional information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that you store as part of relationships and entities as well. So, basically, in the first part,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you have the lexical graph which is representing document structure, but then in the second part,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you extract the relevant entities and their relationships. If you have already an existing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge graph, you can also connect this to an existing knowledge graph. So, imagine you have an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">CRM where you already have customer clients and leads in your knowledge graph, but then you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">enrich this with, for instance, protocols from core transcripts, and then you basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">connect this to your existing structure data as well. So, that's also a possibility. And then in the next phase,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">what you can do is you can run graph algorithms for enrichment, which then, for instance, can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">clustering on the entity graph and then you generate something like communities where an LLM can generate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">summaries across them as such. And for especially last one, it's interesting because what you identify is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">actually cross document topics, right? So, because it's basically each document is in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">basic temporal vertical representation of information, but what this is is actually it looks at which topics are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">reoccurring across many different documents. So, you find these kind of topic clusters across documents as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. So, if you look at the second phase, the search phase, which is basically the retrieval</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">part of rec. What we see here is basically that in a graphic retriever, you don't just do a simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">vector lookup to get returns, results return, but what you do, you do an initial index search. It could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">vector search, full text search, hybrid search, spatial search, other kinds of searches to find the entry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">points in your graph. And then you basically can take, as you can see here, starting from these entry points,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't follow the relationships up to a certain degree or up to a certain relevancy to fetch in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">additional context. And this context can be coming from the user question. It can be external user</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">context that comes in, for instance, when someone from, let's say, your finance department is looking at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">your data, you return different information. And if someone from the, let's say, engineering department is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">looking at your data, right? So, you also take this external context into account, how much and which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">context you retrieve. And then you return to the LLM to generate the answer, not just basically text</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">fragments, like you would do in vector search, but you also create the returnees, more complete</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">subset of the, of the contextual graph to the LLM as well. And modern LLM is actually more trained on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">graph processing as well. So, they can actually deal with these additional pattern structures where you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">node relationship, node patterns that you provide as additional context to the LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, of course, I mentioned that you can enrich it using graph algorithms. So, basically, you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">do things like clustering, link prediction, page rank, and other things to enrich your data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. Let's look at some practical examples. We don't have too much time left.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, one is knowledge graph construction from unstructured sources. So, there's a number of libraries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You've already heard some today from people that do these kind of things. So, one thing that you build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is a tool that allows you to take PDFs, YouTube transcripts, local documents, web articles, Wikipedia</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">articles, and it extracts your data into a graph. And let me just switch over to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">demo here. So, this is the tool. So, I uploaded information from different Wikipedia pages, YouTube</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">videos, articles, and so on. And here's, for instance, a Google DeepMind extraction. So, you can use a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">different LLMs here. And then, you can also, if you want to, in graph enhancement, provide graph schema as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">well. So, you can, for instance, a person works for a company and add these patterns to your, to your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">schema. And then, the LLM is using this information to drive the extraction as well. And so, if you look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the data that has been extracted from DeepMind, it is this one here. We can actually see from the Wikipedia article,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">two aspects. One is the document with the chunks, which is this part of the graph, right? And then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the second part is the entities that have been extracted from, from this article as well. So, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">see, actually, the connected knowledge graph of entities, which are companies, locations, people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and technologies. So, it followed our, followed our schema to extract this. And then, if I want to run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.760</a></span> | <span class="t">graph reg, you have here a number of different retrievers. So, we have vector retriever graph in full text,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and others that you can select. All of this is also an open source project. So, you can just go to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">GitHub and have a look at this. And so, I just ran this before because the internet is not so reliable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">here. So, what has DeepMind worked on? And I get a detailed explanation. And then, if I want to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I can here look at details. So, it shows me which sources that it used. As a folder, Wikipedia,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">another PDF. I see the chunks have been used, which is basically the full text and hybrid search. But then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1005" target="_blank">00:16:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I also see which entities that can use from the graph. So, I can actually really see from an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">explainability perspective, these are the entities that have been retrieved by the graph reg retriever,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">passed to the LLM, in addition to the text that's connected to these entities. So, it gets a richer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">response as such. And then, you can also do evil on that with the as well. So, while I'm on the screen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">let me just show you another thing that we worked on, which is more like an energetic approach where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you basically put these individual retrievers into an configuration where you have basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">domain-specific retrievers that are running individual suffer queries. So, for instance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">if you look at, let's say, this one, it has the query here. And basically, a tool with inputs and a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">description. And then, you can have an agentic loop using these tools, basically doing a graphic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.440</a></span> | <span class="t">with each individual tool, taking the responses, and then doing deeper tool calls. I'll show you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a deeper example in a minute. So, this is basically what I showed you. This is all available as open source</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">libraries. You can use it yourself from Python as well. And what's interesting here in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">agentic approach, you don't just use vector search to retrieve your data, but you basically break down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1094" target="_blank">00:18:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the user question into individual tasks and extract parameters and run these individual tools,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">which then run in sequence or in a loop to return the data, and then you get basically these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">outputs back. And basically, for each of these things, individual tools are called and used here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And the last thing that I want to show is the graphic Python package, which is basically also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">encapsulating all of this in construction and retrieval into one package. So, you can build a knowledge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1124" target="_blank">00:18:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">graph, you can implement retrievers, and create the pipelines here. And here's an example of where I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">pass in PDFs plus a graph schema, and then basically, it runs the import into Neo4j. And then I can,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in the Python notebook, visualize the data later on. And with that, I leave you with one second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">To take away, which is on graphic.com, you find all of these resources, a lot of the patterns,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and we'd love to have contributions, and love to talk more. I'm outside at the booth if you have more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1160" target="_blank">00:19:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">questions. Yeah. So, that was great. And I think you're getting it all from the expert with all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1165" target="_blank">00:19:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">tooling. Actually, Michael's team builds a lot of the tools like Knowledge Graph Builder. Very excited you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">all came to the Graph Rag track and hope to chat with you all more. If you have questions for me and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNneh6-eyPg&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Michael, just meet us in the Neo4j booth across the way. Thank you. Thank you.</span></div></div></body></html>
