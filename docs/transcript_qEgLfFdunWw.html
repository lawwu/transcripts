I'm sure the food is contributing, but having a large bowel movement about the size of a banana is really protective against colon cancer because it means that you have sufficient fiber in your diet that you're having this really good elimination.</p><p>And you want it to be a good chocolatey color, like not necessarily a dark chocolate, and you want it to have some form. It's okay if it breaks apart. When it falls into the bowl, it should retain its form. It shouldn't then fall apart. And a little on the soft side is good.</p><p>It's totally normal to see a little flex of fibrous foods. If you had a big kale salad the night before and you see a little bit of green, that's totally normal. If you are having diarrhea and you're seeing undigested food, like rice grains and stuff, that's a problem. That means that maybe you're not digesting the food properly.</p><p>Maybe you're not absorbing it properly, or maybe the transit time is too fast. It could be any one of those things.</p></div></div></body></html>
