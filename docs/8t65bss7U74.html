maybe give a recap of why you thought it was cool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.120</a></span> |

target="_blank">00:03:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, yeah, you can kind of like enter the paper formally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But what was that interesting to you specifically?</span></div><div class="c"><span

target="_blank">00:03:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">data sets as well, but the outside world is the outside world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so interacting with things that weren't present in the LLM and APIs and calling into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">them and thinking about, and yeah, the React reasoning and acting and kind of like combining</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.120</a></span>

target="_blank">00:03:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I had been playing around with LLMs, been talking with people who were playing around with LLMs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">People were trying to get LLMs to call into APIs, do things.</span></div><div

better?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this paper was basically a step in that direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think really interesting and also really general as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I think that's part of the appeal is just how general and simple in a good way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the idea was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So that it was really appealing for all those reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Simple is always good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you have a favorite part?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I have one favorite part from your PhD defense,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">which I didn't understand when I read the paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But you said something along the lines, React doesn't change the outside or the environment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">but it does change the inside through the context, putting more things in the context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You're not actually changing any of the tools around you to work for you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but you're changing how the model thinks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that was like a very profound thing when I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">not that I've been using these tools for like 18 months, I'm like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I understand what you meant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But like to say that at the time you did the PhD defense was not trivial.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Another way to put it is like thinking can be an extra tool that's useful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It makes sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It checks out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Who would have thought?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's also more controversial within his world because everyone was trying to use RL for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">agents.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is like the first kind of zero gradient type approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the bigger kind of historical context is that we have these two big branches of AI, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you think about RL, right, that's pretty much the equivalent of agent at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's like agent is equivalent to reinforcement learning and reinforcement learning is equivalent to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever game environment they're using, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Atari game or go or whatever.</span></div><div

biased kind of like set of methodologies in terms</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.600</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:05:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">On the other hand, I think NLP is like a historical kind of subject.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not really into agents, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's more about reasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's more about solving those concrete tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you look at S.A.L., right, like each task has its own track, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Summarization has a

rethinking agents in terms of what could be the new environments</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=356"

well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Like those texting are just too

like Wikipedia or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">or like simpler text

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But it kind of worked out for me in that case.</span></div><div class="c"><span

I'd say like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">three common ones might be like a browser, a search tool and a code interpreter.

So one of the questions I actually had for you in this vein, like the React paper,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a thing, I think there's a few things in there, or at least when I think of that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=633" target="_blank">00:10:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a few things that I think of. There's kind of like the specific prompting strategy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then there's like this general idea of kind of like thinking and then taking an action. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">there's just even more general idea of just like taking actions in a loop. Today, like obviously language models have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.080</a></span> | <span class="t">changed a lot. We have tool calling, the specific prompting strategy probably isn't used super</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">heavily anymore. Would you say that like the concept of React is still used though? Or like, do you think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that tool calling and running tool calling in a loop, is that React in your mind?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say like it's like more implicitly used than explicitly used. To be fair, I think the contribution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of React is actually twofold. So first is this idea of, you know, we should be able to use calls in a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">general way. Like there should be a single kind of general method to handle interaction with various</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">environments. I think React is the first paper to demonstrate the idea. But then I think later, there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">two form or whatever, and this become like a trivial idea. But I think at the time, that's like a pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">long trivial thing. And I think the second contribution is this idea of what people call</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like inner monologue or thinking or reasoning or whatever to be paired with tool use. I think that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">still not trivial because if you look at the default function calling or whatever, like there's no inner</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">monologue. And in practice, that actually is important, especially if the tool that you use is pretty different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">from the training distribution of the language model. So I think that's like, those are the two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like main things that are kind of inherited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. On that note, I think OpenAI even recommended like when you're doing tool calling,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it's sometimes helpful to put like a thought field in the tool along with all the actual acquired</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">arguments and then have that one first. So it fills out that first and then, and that's, they've shown</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that that's yielded to kind of like better results. The reason I ask is just like the same concept is still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">alive and I don't know whether to call it like a React agent or not. Like I don't know what to call</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it. Like I think of it as React, like it's the same ideas that were in the paper, but it's obviously a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">very different implementation at this point in time. And so I just don't know what to call it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like people will sometimes think more in terms of different tools, right? Because if you think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">about a web agent versus, you know, like a function calling agent and calling a Python API, you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">think of them as very different. But in some sense, the methodology is the same. It depends on how you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.240</a></span> | <span class="t">view them, right? And I think people will tend to think more in terms of the environment and the tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">rather than the methodology. So, or in other words, I think the methodology is kind of trivial and simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So people will try to focus more on the different tools, but I think it's good to have like a single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">underlying, principle underlying, all of those things. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you see the surface of React getting molded into the model? So a function calling is a good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">example of like, now the model does it. What about the thinking? Now, most models that you use kind of do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">chain of thought on their own. They kind of produce steps. Do you think that more and more of this logic will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">be in the model? Or do you think like the context window will still be the main driver of like reasoning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and thinking? I think it's already default, right? Like you do some chain of thought and you do some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">tool call, like the cost of adding the chain of thought is kind of relatively low compared to other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">things. So it's not hurting to do that. And I think it's already kind of common practice, I would say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this a good place to bring in either tree of thought or reflection? Your pick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe reflection like to respect the time order, I would say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Any backstory as well, like, you know, the people involved with NOAA and like the Princeton</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">group, I think, you know, we talked about this offline, but people don't understand how these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">research pieces come together and this ideation. Yeah. I think reflection is mostly NOAA's work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I'm more like advising kind of role. So the story is, I don't remember the time, but like one day we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">just see this preprint that's like reflection and autonomous agent with memory or whatever. And it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of like a extension to React, which uses this self-refaction. I'm like, oh, somehow it become very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">popular.

It's like, do you want to collaborate on this and make this from like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">archive preprint to something more solid, you know, like a conference submission? I'm like, sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We start, started collaborating and we remain good friends today. And, uh, I think another interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">backstory is like NOAA was like, I think contacted by OpenAI at the time. It's like, this is pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">cool. Do you want to just work at OpenAI? And I think Sierra also reached out at the same time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, this is pretty cool. Do you want to work at Sierra? And, and I think NOAA chose, uh, Sierra,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's pretty cool because he was like, still like a second year undergrad and he's a very smart kid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Based on one paper?

For those who haven't gone too deep on it, the way that you present the inside of React,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like, can you do that also for reflection? Yeah. I think one way to think of reflection is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the traditional idea of reinforcement learning is you have a scalar reward and then you, you somehow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.240</a></span> | <span class="t">back-propagate the signal of the scalar reward to the rest of your neural network through whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">algorithm, like policy gradient or A2C or whatever. And if you think about the real life, you know, most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of the reward signal is not scalar. It's like your boss told you, you know, you should have done a better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">job in this, but a good job on that or whatever. Right. It's not like a scalar reward, like 29 or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">something. I think in general, humans do more, deal more with, you know, long-scale reward, or you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">say language feedback, right? And the way that they deal with language feedback also have this kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">back-propagation kind of process, right? Because you start from this, you did a good job on job B,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you reflect, you know, what could have done different to, to change, to make it better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And you kind of change your prompt, right? Basically, you change your prompt, how to do job A,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and how to do job B, and then you do the whole thing again. So it's really like a pipeline of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">language where, in self-gradient descent, you have something like text reasoning to replace</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">those gradient descent algorithms. I think that's one way to think of reflection, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">One question I have about reflection is, how general do you think the algorithm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">there is? And so for context, I think at Langchain and at other places as well, we found it, like we and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">others found it pretty easy to implement, kind of like React in a standard way. You plug in any tools,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and it kind of works off the shelf, you know, can get it up and running. I don't think we have like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">an off the shelf kind of like implementation of reflection and kind of like the general sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the concepts like absolutely we see used in different kind of like specific cognitive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">architectures, but I don't think we have one that comes off the shelf. I don't think any of the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">frameworks have one that comes off the shelf. And I'm curious whether that's because it's not general</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">enough, or it's complex as well, because it also requires running it more times. Maybe that's not feasible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I'm curious how you think about the generalality complexity. Why? Yeah, should we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">one that comes off the shelf?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the algorithm is general in the sense that it's just as general as like other algorithms,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">if you think about like positive reading or whatever, but it's not applicable to all tasks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">just like other algorithms, right? So you can argue PPO is also general, but it works better for those set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of tasks, but not on those set of tasks. I think it's the same situation for reflection. And I think a key</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">bottleneck is the evaluator, right? Basically, you need to have a good sense of the signal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, like if you're trying to do a very hard reasoning task, say mathematics,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">for example, and you don't have any tools, right? It's operating in this chain of thought setup. Then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">reflection will be pretty hard because in order to reflect upon your thoughts, you have to have a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">good evaluator to judge whether your thought is good or not. But that might be as hard as solving the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">problem itself or even harder. The principle of self-reflection is probably more applicable if you have a good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">evaluator, for example, in the case of coding, right? Like if you have those arrows, then you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1113" target="_blank">00:18:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">just reflect on that and how to solve the bug and stuff. So I think another criteria is that it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1120" target="_blank">00:18:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">depends on the application, right? Like if you have this latency or whatever need for like an actual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">application with an end user, right? And the user wouldn't let you, you know, do like two hours of three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1131" target="_blank">00:18:51.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of thought or reflection, right? You need something as soon as possible. So in that case, maybe this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">better to be used as like a training time technique, right? You do those reflection or tree of thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1141" target="_blank">00:19:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">or whatever, you get a lot of data and then you try to use the data to train your model better. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">in test time, you still use something as simple as React, but that's already improved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1150" target="_blank">00:19:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you think of the Voyager paper as like a way to store skills and then reuse them, like how would you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1156" target="_blank">00:19:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">compare like this like reflective memory and like at what point it's just like ragging on the memory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">versus like you want to start to fine tune some of them or like what's the next step once you get a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">long kind of like a reflective corpus? Yeah. So I think there are two questions here. The first question is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">what type of information or memory are you considering, right? Is it like somatic memory that stores, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge about the word or is it the episodic memory that stores, you know, trajectories or behaviors or is it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like more of a procedural memory? Like in Voyager's case, like skills or code snippets that you can use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1192" target="_blank">00:19:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to do actions, right? That's that's one dimension. And the second dimension is obviously how you use the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1198" target="_blank">00:19:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">memory, either retrieving from it, using it in the context or or fine tuning it. I think the cognitive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1205" target="_blank">00:20:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">architecture for language agents paper have a good kind of categorization of all the different combinations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, what which way you use depends on the concrete application and the concrete need and the concrete</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">task. But I think in general, it's good to think of those like systematic dimensions and all the possible like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">options there. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1225" target="_blank">00:20:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Harrison also has in LangMem.

And I think like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1243" target="_blank">00:20:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, we're still obviously figuring out what that means as is everyone kind of in the space. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1248" target="_blank">00:20:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the experiments that we did and one of the proof of concepts that we did was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1251" target="_blank">00:20:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">technically what it was is you would basically create threads. You'd push messages to those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1256" target="_blank">00:20:56.840</a></span> | <span class="t">threads in the background. We process the data in a few ways. One, we like put it into some semantic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1261" target="_blank">00:21:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">store. That's the semantic memory. And then two, we do some like extraction and reasoning over the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">memories to extract. And we let the user define this, but like extract key facts or anything that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1272" target="_blank">00:21:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of interest to the user. Those aren't exactly trajectories. They're maybe more closer to the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to the procedural memory. Is that how you'd think about it or classify it? Or is it like about like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1283" target="_blank">00:21:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge about the word or is it more like how to do something? It's reflections basically. So in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">generative worlds, generative agents, generative smallville. Yeah. The smallville one. So the way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1293" target="_blank">00:21:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that they had their memory there was they had the sequence of events and that's kind of like the raw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">events that happened. But then every, and events did like run some synthesis over those events</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to, for the, for the LLM to insert its own memory basically. And it's, it's that type of memory. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">don't know how that would be classified. I think of that more of the semantic memory, but to be fair,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1313" target="_blank">00:21:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's just one way to think of that. But whether it's semantic memory or procedure memory or whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">memory, that's like, like abstraction layer.

So they're totally kind of orthogonal. I think it's more of a good way to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1329" target="_blank">00:22:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">think of the things because like from the history of cognitive science and you know, cognitive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1334" target="_blank">00:22:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">architecture and how people study even neuroscience, right? That's the way people think of how human brain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1339" target="_blank">00:22:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">organizes memory. And I think it's more useful as a way to think of things, but it's not like for semantic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1345" target="_blank">00:22:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">memory, you have to do this kind of like way to retrieve or fine tune.

And how much does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1549" target="_blank">00:25:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it improve on those tasks?

If there's absolute reason to add</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1671" target="_blank">00:27:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">reflection or whatever, you should add that. Otherwise, if chain of thought can already solve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1674" target="_blank">00:27:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">something, then you don't even need to use any of that. Yeah. Or if just better prompting can solve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1678" target="_blank">00:27:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it.

I think another interesting thing is like, I personally have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1687" target="_blank">00:28:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">never done those kind of like weird tricks.

It's like, I don't know, like, like I never say something like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1695" target="_blank">00:28:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">your grandma is dying and you have to solve it too. I mean, those are cool, but I feel like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1700" target="_blank">00:28:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we should all try to solve this in like a very intuitive way. Like, just like talking to your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1705" target="_blank">00:28:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">co-worker and that, that should work 99% of the time. That's my personal take. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1709" target="_blank">00:28:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The problem with how language models, at least in these sort of GPC3 era, was that they're,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1715" target="_blank">00:28:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">they over optimized to some sets of tokens in sequence. So like what reading the Kojima et al. paper,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1722" target="_blank">00:28:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that was listening step by step, like he tried a bunch of them and they had wildly different results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1727" target="_blank">00:28:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It should not be the case, but it is the case. And hopefully we're getting better there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1730" target="_blank">00:28:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I think it's also like a timing thing in the sense that if you think about this whole line of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1735" target="_blank">00:28:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">language model, right? Like at the time it was just like a text generator. We don't have any idea how it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1741" target="_blank">00:29:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be used. Right. And obviously at the time you will find all kinds of weird issues because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1746" target="_blank">00:29:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not trained to do any of that. Right. But then I think we have this loop where once we realize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1752" target="_blank">00:29:12.520</a></span> | <span class="t">chain of thought is important or agent is important or tool using is important. What we see is today's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1757" target="_blank">00:29:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">language models are heavily optimized towards those things. So I think in some sense they become more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1762" target="_blank">00:29:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">reliable and robust over those use cases. And, uh, you don't need to do as much prompt engineering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1768" target="_blank">00:29:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">tricks anymore to, to solve those things. I feel like in some sense, I feel like prompt engineering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1773" target="_blank">00:29:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">even is like a slightly negative word at the time because it refers to all those kind of weird tricks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1778" target="_blank">00:29:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that you have to apply. But I think we don't have to do that anymore. Like given today's progress,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1782" target="_blank">00:29:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you should just be able to talk to like a coworker and if you're clear and concrete and you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1788" target="_blank">00:29:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">being reasonable, then it should be reasonable things for you. Yeah. Yeah. The way I put this is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1792" target="_blank">00:29:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, you should not be a prompt engineer because it is the goal of the big labs to put you out of a job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1796" target="_blank">00:29:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You should just be a good communicator.

And I think that's the key though, because oftentimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1804" target="_blank">00:30:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">people aren't good communicators to these language models and that is a very important skill and that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1808" target="_blank">00:30:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">still messing around with the prompt. And so it depends what you're talking about when you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1812" target="_blank">00:30:12.760</a></span> | <span class="t">saying prompt engineer. But do you think it's like very correlated with like, are they like a good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1817" target="_blank">00:30:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">communicator to humans? You know, it's like it may be, but I also think I would say on average,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1822" target="_blank">00:30:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">people are probably worse at communicating with language models than to humans. That's for sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1825" target="_blank">00:30:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Right now, at least, because I think we're still figuring out how to do it. You kind of expect it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1828" target="_blank">00:30:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to be magical and there's probably some correlation, but I'd say there's also just like people are worse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1834" target="_blank">00:30:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">at it right now than talking to you.

It's more about we don't have good tasks. It's also very interesting, right? Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1877" target="_blank">00:31:17.080</a></span> | <span class="t">if you look at my citations, like obviously the most cited are React, Reflection, and Treehouse,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=1881" target="_blank">00:31:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">all those are methodologies.

And the idea is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2243" target="_blank">00:37:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">first, if you care about coding, then you should solve coding in an interactive way, meaning more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2248" target="_blank">00:37:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">like a Jupyter notebook kind of way than just writing a program and seeing if fails or succeeds and stop,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2255" target="_blank">00:37:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">right? You should solve it in an interactive way. That's because that's exactly how humans solve it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2259" target="_blank">00:37:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">right? If I tell you to, you know, write a program like next token, next token, next token and stop and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2267" target="_blank">00:37:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">never do any edits and you cannot really use any terminal or whatever tool, it doesn't make sense,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2272" target="_blank">00:37:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And that's the way people are solving coding at the time. Basically like sampling a program from a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2278" target="_blank">00:37:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">language model without chain of thought, without tool call, without reflection, without anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2282" target="_blank">00:38:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So first point is we should solve code coding in a very interactive way. And that's a very general</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2287" target="_blank">00:38:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">principle that applies for various coding benchmarks. But also I think you can make a lot of the agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2294" target="_blank">00:38:14.760</a></span> | <span class="t">tasks kind of like interactive coding. If you have Python and you can call any package, then you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2300" target="_blank">00:38:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">literally also browse internet or do whatever you want, like control a robot or whatever. So that seems</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2306" target="_blank">00:38:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to be a very general paradigm. But obviously I think a bottleneck is at the time we're still doing, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2312" target="_blank">00:38:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">very simple tasks like human evil or whatever coding benchmark people proposed.

They don't behave differently under different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2866" target="_blank">00:47:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">contexts. They do one thing and they always work the same way. It's easy for humans. It's easy for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2871" target="_blank">00:47:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">LMs. And like that makes a lot of sense. And obviously adding types is another one. Like type</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2875" target="_blank">00:47:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">annotations only help give extra context, which is really great. So that's the agreement. And then a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2880" target="_blank">00:48:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">disagreement is that I've actually, when I use structured output to do my chain of thought, I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2885" target="_blank">00:48:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">found that I change my field names to hint to the LLM of what the field is supposed to do. So instead of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2892" target="_blank">00:48:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">saying topics, I'll say candidate topics. And that gives me a better result because the LLM was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2897" target="_blank">00:48:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">"Ah, this is just a draft thing I can use for chain of thought."

So like little stuff like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2907" target="_blank">00:48:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I find myself optimizing for the LLM where I as a human would never do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2911" target="_blank">00:48:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting.

There's a lot more use of metadata as well, like descriptions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=2931" target="_blank">00:48:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">comments, code comments, annotations and stuff like that.

It's not a massive JSON blob. And I think that matters. I think like when you talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3010" target="_blank">00:50:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">designing tools, it's not only the, it's the interface in the entirety, not only the inputs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3014" target="_blank">00:50:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">but also the outputs that really matter. And so I think they try to make the outputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3018" target="_blank">00:50:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">They're doing ACI. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Really. Like there, there's a whole set of industries that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3023" target="_blank">00:50:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">are just being redone for ACI. It's weird. And so my, my simple answer to, to them was like the error</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3029" target="_blank">00:50:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">messages. When you give error messages, they should be basically prompts for the LLM to take and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3035" target="_blank">00:50:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">self-correct. Then your error messages get more verbose actually than you normally would with a human.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3039" target="_blank">00:50:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff like that. Like a little, honestly, it's not that big. Again, like, is this worth a venture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3044" target="_blank">00:50:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">backed industry? Unless you can tell us, but like, I think code interpreter, I think is a new thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3051" target="_blank">00:50:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I hope so. We invested in E2B. So I think that's a very interesting point. You're trying to optimize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3056" target="_blank">00:50:56.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to the extreme. Then obviously they're going to be different. For example, the error, take it very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3060" target="_blank">00:51:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">seriously. Right. The error for, for like language model, the longer, the better. But for humans,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3065" target="_blank">00:51:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that will make them very nervous and very tired. Right. But, but I guess that the point is more like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3070" target="_blank">00:51:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe we should try to find a co optimized common ground as much as possible. And then if we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3076" target="_blank">00:51:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">divergence, then we should try to diverge. But it's more philosophical now. But I think like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3080" target="_blank">00:51:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">part of it is like how you use it. So Google invented the page rank because ideally you only click</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3085" target="_blank">00:51:25.640</a></span> | <span class="t">on one link, you know, like the top three should have the answer. But like with models, it's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3089" target="_blank">00:51:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">well, you can get 20. So those searches are more like semantic grouping in a way. It's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3094" target="_blank">00:51:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">for this query, I'll return you like 20, 30 things that are kind of good, you know? So it's less about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3100" target="_blank">00:51:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">ranking and it's more about grouping. Another fundamental thing about ACI is the difference</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3105" target="_blank">00:51:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">between human and machine's kind of memory limit. Right. So I think what's really interesting about this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3111" target="_blank">00:51:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">concept of ACI versus HCI is interfaces that's optimized for them. You can kind of understand some of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3117" target="_blank">00:51:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">fundamental characteristics differences of humans and machines, right? Why, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3122" target="_blank">00:52:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">if you look at find or whatever terminal command, you know, you can only look at it one thing at a time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3128" target="_blank">00:52:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">or that's because we have a very small working memory. You can only deal with one thing at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=3133" target="_blank">00:52:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You can only look at one paragraph of text at the same time.

Because you also get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4105" target="_blank">01:08:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">asked this question a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4106" target="_blank">01:08:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I think it's very aligned.

I think this is basically episodic memory, like trajectories of correct things. But there's also,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4351" target="_blank">01:12:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">then I think a very different type is like personalization.

It's very similar to threads in open AI's assistant API, but you can define the state</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4386" target="_blank">01:13:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">however you want.

So then if you basically want to scope a memory to a user ID or to an assistant or to an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4400" target="_blank">01:13:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">organization, then you can do that.

For example, like Notion is more complex than Google Docs, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4432" target="_blank">01:13:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">if you use it well, then it gives you more capability, right? And it's like different tool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4437" target="_blank">01:13:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">might suit different applications or scenarios or whatever. Yeah. We should make more good tools,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4443" target="_blank">01:14:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess. My quick take is when I started writing about the AI engineer, this was kind of vaguely in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4448" target="_blank">01:14:08.760</a></span> | <span class="t">my head, but like this is basically the job. Everything outside the LLM is the AI engineer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4453" target="_blank">01:14:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that the researcher is not going to do. This basically maps to LLMOS. I would add in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4460" target="_blank">01:14:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">code interpreter, the browser and the other stuff, but yeah, this is mostly it. Yeah, those are the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4465" target="_blank">01:14:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, those are the tools, yeah. Those are the external environment, which is a small box at the bottom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4470" target="_blank">01:14:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So then having this like reasonable level of confidence, like I know what things are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4474" target="_blank">01:14:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">then I want to break it. I want to be like, okay, like what's coming up that's going to blindside me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4478" target="_blank">01:14:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">completely.

I think the short answer is understanding is always better. It's like a way of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4522" target="_blank">01:15:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding things. Like the solid experiment that I write at the end of the paper is, imagine you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4527" target="_blank">01:15:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">GPT-10, which is really good.

Just input,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4532" target="_blank">01:15:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">output, just stick to stick, right? It doesn't even need to do browsing or whatever, or maybe it still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4537" target="_blank">01:15:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">needs some tools, but let's say like, it's really powerful. Like then I think even in that point, I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4543" target="_blank">01:15:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">something like Koala is still useful if we want to do some neuroscience on GPT-10. It's like kind of doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4548" target="_blank">01:15:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">human kind of neuroscience, right?

So it's like agent simulating with other agents. This has always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4612" target="_blank">01:16:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">been my thing with startups doing agents. I'm like, one day there's going to be training grounds for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4618" target="_blank">01:16:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">companies to train agents that they hire. Actually, Singapore is the first country to build the cyber</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4623" target="_blank">01:17:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">range for cyber attack training. And I think you'll see more of that. So what was the inspiration there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4629" target="_blank">01:17:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of these models are bad at it, which is great. You know, we have some room for, I think the best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4634" target="_blank">01:17:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">model is for all at like 48% average. So there's a lot of room to go. Yeah. Any fun stories from there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4640" target="_blank">01:17:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">directions that you hope that people take?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4642" target="_blank">01:17:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. First, I think shout out to Sierra, which is this a very good startup, which was funded by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4650" target="_blank">01:17:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Brad Taylor and Clay Beaver. And Sierra is a startup doing conversational AI. So what they do is they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4657" target="_blank">01:17:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">they build agents for businesses. Like suppose you have a business and you have a customer service,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4662" target="_blank">01:17:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we want to automate that part. And then it becomes very interesting because it's very different from coding or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4669" target="_blank">01:17:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">web agent or whatever people are doing, because it's more about how can you do simple things reliably.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4674" target="_blank">01:17:54.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not about, you know, can you sample a hundred times and you find one good mass proof or kill</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4679" target="_blank">01:17:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">solution. It's more about you chat with a hundred different users on very simple things. Can you be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4684" target="_blank">01:18:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">robust to solve like 99% of the time? Right. And then we find there's no really good benchmark around this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4691" target="_blank">01:18:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's one thing. I guess another thing is obviously this kind of customer service kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4695" target="_blank">01:18:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of domain. Previously, there are some benchmarks, but they all have their limitations. And I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4701" target="_blank">01:18:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you want the task to be kind of hard and you want user simulation to be real. We don't have that until</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4708" target="_blank">01:18:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">LLM. So data sets from 10 years ago, like either just have trajectories, conversating with humans,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4714" target="_blank">01:18:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">or they have very fake kind of simulators. I think right now is a good opportunity to, if you really just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4719" target="_blank">01:18:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">care about this task of customer service, then it's a good opportunity because now you have LLMs to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4724" target="_blank">01:18:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">simulate humans. But I think a more general motivation is we don't have enough agent benchmarks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4728" target="_blank">01:18:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that target this kind of robustness, reliability kind of standpoint. It's more about, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4733" target="_blank">01:18:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">code or web. So this is a very good addition to the landscape. If you have a model that can simulate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4740" target="_blank">01:19:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the persona, like the user, the right way, shouldn't the model also be able to accomplish the task,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4745" target="_blank">01:19:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">right? If he has the knowledge of like what the person will want, then it means...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4748" target="_blank">01:19:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a great question. I think it really stems from like asymmetry of information, right? Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4754" target="_blank">01:19:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">if you think about the customer service agent, it has information that you cannot, you cannot access,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4758" target="_blank">01:19:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Like the APIs it could call or, you know, the policies of internal company policy, whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4764" target="_blank">01:19:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And that I think very interesting for TallBench is like, it's kind of okay for the user to be kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4769" target="_blank">01:19:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">stupid. So you can imagine like there are failure cases, right? But I think in our case, as long as the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4775" target="_blank">01:19:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">user specified the need very clearly, then it's up to the agent to figure out, for example, what is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4782" target="_blank">01:19:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">second cheapest flight from this to that under that constraint, very complicated reasoning involved. Like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4787" target="_blank">01:19:47.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we shouldn't require users to be able to solve those things. They should just be able to clearly express</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4793" target="_blank">01:19:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">their need. But then if the task failed, then it's up to the agent. That makes the evaluation much easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4799" target="_blank">01:19:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Awesome.

One thing that I've seen more of recently, I guess the general category would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4864" target="_blank">01:21:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">be like research style agents, specific things recently would be like, I've seen a few like AISDR</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4871" target="_blank">01:21:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">companies pop up, where they basically do some data enrichment, they get a company name, they go out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4876" target="_blank">01:21:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">find like, you know, funding.

It's an entry level job title in B2B SaaS.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4882" target="_blank">01:21:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

There was some debate, but they raised a lot of money. So who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4909" target="_blank">01:21:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">knows? I'd say those are, those are a few of the categories that jump to mind. Like entry type kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4914" target="_blank">01:21:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of research. On the topic of applications though, the thing that I think is most interesting in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4918" target="_blank">01:21:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">space right now is probably all the UXs around these apps and the different things besides chat that might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4924" target="_blank">01:22:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">come out. I think two that I'm really interested in, one for the idea of this AISDR. I've seen a bunch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4930" target="_blank">01:22:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">them do it in kind of like a spreadsheet style view where you have like, you know, 10 different companies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4936" target="_blank">01:22:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">or hundreds of different companies and five different attributes you want to run up and then each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4940" target="_blank">01:22:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">cell is an agent. And I guess the good, the good thing about this is like, you can already use the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4943" target="_blank">01:22:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">first couple of rules of spreadsheet as a few shot example or whatever. There's so many good things about it. Yeah. You can, you can test it out on a few. It's a great way for humans to run things in batch, which I don't, it's a great interface for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4944" target="_blank">01:22:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's still kind of elusive to do this kind of like PhD kind of research, but I think those kind of entry type research where it's more repetitive and it should be automated. And then the other UX I'm really, really interested is, is kind of like when you have agents running in the background, how can they, like ambient style agents, how can they reach out to you? So I think like as an example of this, I have an email assistant,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4974" target="_blank">01:22:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">um, that runs in the background, it treasers all my emails and it tries to respond to them. And then when it needs my input, like, Hey, do you want to do this podcast? It reaches out to me. It sends me a message.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4983" target="_blank">01:23:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, you actually, Oh, you, you have it. It is live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4985" target="_blank">01:23:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I use it for all my emails.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4987" target="_blank">01:23:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4988" target="_blank">01:23:08.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, we did Twitter.

I want both.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=4996" target="_blank">01:23:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

Are people, we talked about this. Oh, yeah. It's not low code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=5009" target="_blank">01:23:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Lengraph is not low code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=5011" target="_blank">01:23:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can cut this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=5012" target="_blank">01:23:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">No, no, no, no, no. People, people will tune in just for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=5015" target="_blank">01:23:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it actually, it actually has to do with UXs as well. So like probably sums back to this idea of, I think like what it means to build with AI is changing. Like I still really, really strongly believe that developers will be a core kind of like part of this, largely because we see like, you need a lot of control over these agents to get them to work reliably. But there's also very clearly components that you don't need to be a developer for prompting is kind of like the most obvious one. With Lengraph, one of the things that you don't need to be a developer for prompting is kind of like the most obvious one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=5039" target="_blank">01:23:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">With Lengraph, one of the things that we added recently was like a Lengraph studio. So it's, we called it kind of like an IDE for agents. You point it to your code file where you have your graph defined in code. It spins up a representation of the graph. You can interact with it there. You can test it out. We fucked it up to kind of like a persistence layer. So you can do time travel stuff, which I think is another really cool UX that I first saw in Devon and was, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=5061" target="_blank">01:24:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Devon's time travel is good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=5063" target="_blank">01:24:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">The UX for Devon in general, I think you said it, but that was the novel. That was the best part. But to the low code, no code part, the way that I think about it is you probably want to have your cognitive architecture defined in code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=5075" target="_blank">01:24:35.980</a></span> | <span class="t">A decision making procedure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=5077" target="_blank">01:24:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. But then there's parts within that that are prompts or maybe configuration options, like something to do with RAG or something like that. We've seen that be a popular configuration option.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=5088" target="_blank">01:24:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So is it useful for programmers more or is it for like people who cannot program? I guess if you cannot program, it's still very complicated for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=5095" target="_blank">01:24:55.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It's useful for both. I think like we see it being useful for developers right now, but then we also see like there's often teams building this, right? It's not one person. And so I think there's this handoff where the engineer might define the cognitive architecture. They might do some initial prompt engineering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=5108" target="_blank">01:25:08.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It's easier to communicate to the product manager.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=5110" target="_blank">01:25:10.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It's easier to show them what's going on and it's easier to let them control it and maybe they're doing the prompting. And so, yeah, I think what the TLDR is like what it means to build is changing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=5119" target="_blank">01:25:19.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And also like UX is UX in general is interesting, whether it's for how to build these agents or for how to use them as end consumers. And there might also be overlap as well. And it's so early on and no one knows anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=5130" target="_blank">01:25:30.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think UX is one of the most exciting spaces to be innovating in right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t65bss7U74&t=5134" target="_blank">01:25:34.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's do ACI.
