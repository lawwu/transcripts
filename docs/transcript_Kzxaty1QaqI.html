Today we got the one and only Vaughn Miller with me. - Yeah boy. - Appreciate you being on my guy. - Yeah, appreciate you, huh? - You already know. So we gonna start off in the football space.</p><p>Obviously that's where everybody know you from, but like growing up, football is a lot different than basketball. Like you gotta be, like it's a lot more of a physical sport and then you play the most physical position. - Yeah, it's one of them. You know, I wouldn't say it's the, I wouldn't say it's the most physical though.</p><p>- Yeah, so like growing up though, like how did you, how did you get into that? And then how did you kind of, kind of get to where you have to be to play you at today? - Oh, bro, like my, my earliest memories of like my childhood, right?</p><p>I remember like, you know, I was like two years old and I got in like this little pot in my mom's kitchen, right? It's like this little pot. And I think that, I think that memory is like reinforced because I got like pictures that my mom always showed me and stuff.</p><p>But another memory that I had was like my dad, like me hearing my dad scream, like for the first time, like, and I ran in the room and I look in the room and he like yelling, like, not like in like, not like he crying or nothing, like he hurting or nothing, but it's like, he was like happy.</p><p>He was like so happy. The Cowboys were on the game. I mean, the Cowboys on the TV and they had just scored or something, he was like going crazy. And I just remember being like a little kid and seeing my daddy like reacting this way. And like, that's where it started.</p><p>Like, I want to make my dad, like, I want to do that. Like, I want to, whatever they doing on TV, that's what I want. - That's crazy. Yeah, that's kind of, that's kind of how it was for me. Started early. My pops played hoop basketball and then he could put the ball in my hand, three years old.</p><p>Just got rolling from there. You just find a passion for it. And then it just roll from there. But for you, so it was all that. And then you get to the, you go to college, get to the league, you know, you doing your thing, become one of the best pretty quick at your position.</p><p>Then end up winning Super Bowl 50 MVP. Talk to me a little bit about that. Like when you got in the league and in the process to winning that and then that feeling. - Yeah, honestly, like at first, like I always felt like, you know, you just have like that belief in yourself.</p><p>Like whatever you put your mind to, you're going to do it. I think we all like, you know, have those thoughts. But for me, I never thought that I would be like the number two pick or like fight for the Denver Broncos or like winning Super Bowl, do all this crazy stuff.</p><p>I knew like deep down in my heart, like if I worked hard enough and I did all the right things and I went to sleep, you know, like all the stuff that you do, like as a kid, like you believe that you can make the, you believe that you can make the league.</p><p>And I felt like that. And it just, it just start like playing Texas A&M, like my first two years. I was like, I was, I wasn't like, you know, all American, nothing crazy, nothing like that. But like my third year, they moved me to this outside linebacker, like rush position.</p><p>And I just kind of like took off with it. At the same time I was at Texas A&M and I was taking easy classes. I mean, my GPA wasn't like, you know, my GPA wasn't like the best. So I had to like take like classes to like help out with my GPA.</p><p>And one of those classes was meat production, one-on-one chickens, turkey and quail. So I took this class and it was an easy class. And I was like, it's like, bro, it's so easy. Like I don't even have to stay awake. So I used to fall asleep in this class and my professor, Dr.</p><p>Farnell, he used to wake me up. He used to wake me up and like, like making me go, like just make me like recite, like everything that we learned in the class today. In turn, it really made me like learn like the chicken, like business. And that was like my backup plan.</p><p>It was weird. Like if I make it to the league, you know, I'm gonna use the money to start a chicken farm, man. - Yeah, and I was actually, I was gonna ask you about that later, the chicken farm. I mean, everybody know you for that off the field.</p><p>How big is that like in your life and how did you, so you got into it just as a backup plan. - It was just, it was just one of the, I swear like, bro, you know, you take a lot of classes, bro. You never expect them, you know, you never expect them bitches to like stick like that.</p><p>But like when I, when I was learning it and it takes an NM, I was like, bro, all I need is this amount of money and I can do it. You know, I damn near using like loans to do that stuff. Like if I like playing the league, I can use money to do it this way.</p><p>And I just started researching. I hooked up with some fellow Aggies as well. And we started Green Pastures Chicken. It's like right outside of Elgin. It's doing well, you know. - Yeah, how big is that? Like as far as obviously you make your bread on the field, but is that just a passion or is it actually lucrative?</p><p>- I mean, it's, it's, it's both, you know, you don't, you wouldn't do it. Like if it wasn't like, you know, like just selling shit. But it's, I mean, but it's, you know, it's, it's both, you know, it's something that I like, it's kind of like football for me off the field.</p><p>Like I like had this vision and I just attacked it. And, you know, it just became, you know, what it is. We're not like Tyson or like Sanderson Farms or like Butterball like that, but that's my dream. You know, one day is to, is to create an operation like those guys.</p><p>A pasture raised, a pasture raised, fully organic, humanely raised product. Cause I feel like that is the, that's the, that's the main certification on some of this stuff. Cause people want to know like where their food comes from. And I have a humanely raised product. - So you, so you take care of your, like you all about that as far as organic, raised the right way.</p><p>- They, they only have one bad day. You know, every day is good. And then they just, they just have one. - You gotta plug me with some of the chicken. - Yeah, for sure, man. I'll send it to you. - Cause I, I was growing up, like I grew up vegetarian my whole life.</p><p>Then I got to the league, I was too skinny. So they made me start eating some chicken and some salmon. So I only eat like the healthy chicken. So yeah, you definitely got to plug me then. - Yeah, bro. I got you, bro. You was vegetarian your whole life?</p><p>- I grew up vegetarian all the way until I got to the NBA. - I thought it was like, I thought it was like a new thing, like vegetarian. - Nah, our parents, my mom, my mom and dad raised all of us that way. We was homeschooled, vegetarian, like all that.</p><p>Like before it was a really, like it's more of a popular thing now. We were doing that. To eat healthy, you know this, you really got to have a chef or someone that's doing it for you. Cause like a lot of these restaurants that say they're healthy, they're really not that healthy.</p><p>So we probably weren't doing it the best way, but we were, I mean, we was trying, we was vegetarian. - That's crazy, man. I mean, when you think about it, I just had a son and like I was doing like this study, like on what like kids eat, because I wanted Val to be just like the biggest, like, you know, strongest like baby ever.</p><p>And you started doing your research and it's like the first year, the first year to like year and a half, like they breastfed, like that's it. You might supplement it with some other stuff, but they don't start off like wanting meat or like needing meat. And if you just, you know, stay in that lane, like I can see like how somebody could be vegetarian their whole life.</p><p>- Yeah, you definitely got to do it the right way though. So yeah, you just mentioned your son. Talk about that. Is he like, how old is he? And then, cause we was going to talk about that too. You, has it changed your perspective at all on life and what you really prioritize or value?</p><p>- You know, people always say that, but I think like, you know, I've been a dad for like a while now. Like I'm 11 years, you know, in the National Football League. So I got a shit load of sons everywhere. (laughing) No, no, but I just always, I'm an older brother, you know, and my dad and my mom, like they just been in my life since like day one.</p><p>I had great examples on how to be like a father, I would say, like just kicking it with like my dad and like some of the stuff that he did with me. I was like, man, I can't wait to like, you know, do this with my son. Some of the, some of the things that I learned like from my dad, some of the advice that I got, like I always had him like in every single, which is like, you know, it's a true blessing that me thinking about my dad, but you know, just by having my dad like with me through like every single decision that I ever had, like to make in my life, you know, I always wanted to like have a son and do that same thing.</p><p>I remember when I had him, I talked to him and I said, hey, like, so what makes you a great dad? Like he was like, it's so many, he said it's so many different things that make you a great dad. Okay, I was like, so what, what makes you a bad dad?</p><p>He was like, it's just a few things that'll make you a bad dad. It's all type of ways that you can parent. It's all type of ways that you can, you know, be in your kid life. And you know, that's what I want to do. I want to play golf.</p><p>You know, that's really the only thing that I'm gonna force on him. - Yeah. - Anything else, you know, I'm-- - What'd he say though about being a bad dad? What's the ways you-- - You know, like it's all different ways to be a bad dad. Like you can influence your son to do things.</p><p>I feel like me, I just want to give the best in me because nobody's perfect. You know, I just want to give the best in me to my son and just let him create his own like, you know, lane. You know, but I'm excited about it. Like all the summer, like before he got here, I was working on his nursery.</p><p>I was all on Pinterest, like just trying to find like little things. It was crazy. You know, you never use the word cute, but like when you got like a kid, like it's just the word that you use. It's just the word that like, you know, it's all over the place.</p><p>And I got like some dope stuff for him in his nursery. I want it to be like a cowboy vibe. 'Cause I feel like Valor is like, you know, like a cowboy like type name. But you know, he's five weeks old, man. And I'm excited, man. Every single day he learned something new, something different.</p><p>- That's dope. - Yeah. - That's dope. Yeah, you and your dad, like everybody see how close y'all are, joking around and everything. That's dope. That's how I am with my dad. Like he's one of my best friends. The relationship changes as you get older. Were y'all always close like that?</p><p>Or kind of what, what made y'all get close like that? - You know, growing up, I thought my dad was like mean. I was like, "Damn, my daddy mean." (laughing) I got my little brother older. And I was like, "Damn, my daddy mean." Like, "Why he so strict?" Like, you know, like other kids doing this and like other kids like doing that.</p><p>And you see like other people doing this. And it's not till like you get older that you like appreciate all the things that your dad like made you do. Like being a senior in high school and having to come in at like 12 and like, you know, having to curfew and like, you know, just learning like tough lessons growing up, like don't lie to 'em, don't do this.</p><p>You know, getting whoopings and like just really just trying to figure it out. Like I really appreciate, you know, all that stuff that my dad like did for my dad and my mom. 'Cause my mom, she's a soldier too. My mom, she's never missed, you know, anything that I ever participated in from like track meet to my basketball games.</p><p>I had hoop dreams at first. - You hooped? I was gonna ask you about that. I actually was gonna ask. - I had hoop dreams at first, but like, they didn't give me enough fouls. Like I was just, I was just too physical, bro. - My question for you was gonna be, is it, would you think it'd be harder to go from the NFL to the NBA or from the NBA to the NFL?</p><p>No bias. - Man, it's two different body types, bro. Like if you get like the right body type, both can play. Like you gotta at least be like six, four, six, like five. You know, like I always think like Gronkowski could play like both. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You know, like Justin Simmons, like, I feel like he could play both.</p><p>He could be like a point guard and a safety in the league. - Who's some hoopers that could play both? - I think LeBron James could definitely, right? LeBron could definitely play both. - Zion, probably. - I think Russell. Yeah, Zion, Russell, Westbrook, he could definitely play both. You know, like most of these point guards, like, I think, you know, like John Wall, he could play like both.</p><p>Most of these point guards, they got like, you know, these aggressive mindsets. - Yeah. - You know, and then at the same time, not like being a great football player, like probably like being a great basketball player. It's not all about like just brute strength and like going crazy.</p><p>Sometimes you gotta be, you gotta be smart and you gotta be able to like outwork your guy. So if you have like some of those things, which there's a lot of basketball players that you don't have that type of mindset, you could play both. - Right, so-- - All you need is an arm, really, though, and you can play like, any body type can play quarterback.</p><p>- Right. - You can be six, six. - Kicker or something. - Or kicker. No, you don't wanna be no kicker. I know some good kickers, though. Like Brandon McManus, that's my boy. You know, like, that's my favorite. That's my favorite kicker, but you don't wanna be no kicker.</p><p>Brandon's different because he's 6'4", 210 pounds. He can dunk. He can play basketball. He can throw the ball. Like, he's fast. He's not too fast, but, you know, he's fast and he can, you know, he's smart. He can do all types of shit. So I think Brandon McManus could play both, too.</p><p>- That's dope. - You think any football players could play both? Like, any mindsets? - Shoot, I don't know. 'Cause you see some football players step on the court. They look crazy. - That's crazy. That's how I am. That's me. - They look crazy, dog. Like, I would never play pickup with a football player 'cause they gonna hurt you.</p><p>- That's me. It's just too, I'm just too fast, too fast. I think, you know, really, that was, like, younger. You know, I didn't, like, play it, like, from day one. Like, it was something that, like, in my school, in my high school, like, I had braids. Like, yeah, like cornrows.</p><p>- Oh, for real? - Like, yeah, that was, like, my guy. Like, I wanted to be, like, me and my little brother. So, I wanted to, you know, be, like, AI. And I had braids, but it was a rule in my school district that if you had braids, you couldn't play basketball.</p><p>So, it kind of, like, pushed my-- - What? - It kind of pushed, like, my-- I was playing street basketball the whole time, but it kind of pushed, like, my real, real, like, basketball development all the way to, like, my ninth grade year. - That's weird. I ain't never had that rule.</p><p>- If it was cool, like, I could've played both, like, you know, since day one, and who knows what would happen. But, it ain't like that. - You ended up cool. - I ended up being Von Miller Chicken Farmer. - Man, so, recently, you, like, the last couple years, you obviously, we're getting back to it now, but you faced some adversity, you know?</p><p>I know all about injuries, and you went through something similar over the last little bit. Talk about that. Like, how did it happen? How did you get hurt, and then what was your mindset, you know, through the rehab and getting back? - Yeah. - Are you, like, cautious at all now, or do you feel good?</p><p>- Man, I just feel like injuries are just, like, part of the game. If you look at any great player in the history of any sport, you know, they had to overcome some injury at some point in time. We play a sport, like, our body's not designed to, like, run around and, like, dunk.</p><p>Even though you get these guys like you that, like, can jump from the free throw line and dunk, well, like, our body's not, like, designed like that. So if you're moving fast and you can't really predict everything that's going on, like, you know, injuries happen. It's just really the way you respond.</p><p>- Yeah. - You know, I've had three, like, big injuries. Really, my thumb, it wasn't that bad, but if you play football, like, not having your thumb is tough, but I had an ACL in 2013, and I tore my retinaculum in my, like, it holds down, like, the peroneal tendon, like, on your ankle.</p><p>It wasn't like an Achilles or anything like that, but I still needed surgery, and I wasn't able to, like, get back. So it was a serious injury. It wasn't, like, a serious surgery, but it was, like, a serious injury. And really, your mindset, you really just, you gotta respond, bro.</p><p>Like, I think what makes us great football players or great athletes or great basketball players is our ability to respond. You play against somebody that's, you know, that can move faster and dunk, you know, whatever. Like, you can figure it out, and you rely on your skill set, and that's the same thing.</p><p>That's the same mindset that you have whenever you're going through the recovery process. - That's dope. Man, my last football question's for you. You gotta tell me your top three QBs, like, the ones you hate playing against, and then you gotta name your top five defenders right now in the league.</p><p>- Top five QBs, I mean, like, right off the top, you gotta say, like, Tom Brady. Like, Tom Brady, you know, Patrick Mahomes, Peyton Manning. You know, you got Aaron Rodgers. You know, you got so many different quarterbacks that, you know, wanted to do great stuff. I love Dak Prescott as one of my favorite quarterbacks.</p><p>But, you know, top quarterbacks right now, you gotta go with winning first. Like, you know, Tom Brady, you know, Peyton Manning, Patrick Mahomes. These guys, like, these guys win. - Yeah, they win. - So, those would be, like, you know, the top three quarterbacks that I've been, that I've played, like, all the time.</p><p>I didn't play against Peyton, but I was around him every single day, and I saw the way he, you know, attacked defenses. I wouldn't want to play against him, but. - You know, it's just so crazy about that. I actually just talked to Peyton yesterday. He was up at the arena last night.</p><p>- Yeah, that's cool. - Shooting with his kids, and I hollered at him for, like, 30 minutes, talking about, like, what made him different. Like, how did he separate himself as far as being one of the greats. So, that's crazy, 'cause he was cold. I grew up in Indianapolis.</p><p>- Oh, yeah, that's dope, that's dope. Yeah, Peyton, yeah, Peyton, he, I was with him for four years, and, like, that's one of my favorite teammates, favorite players ever. I went to his Hall of Fame, like, his Hall of Fame ceremony, and I went to Chattanooga's Hall of Fame ceremony, too, so this is my second one, but this was my first, like, after-party at, like, the Hall of Fame, 'cause Coach Fangio let us stay, like, a whole day, and the next night out there.</p><p>But, really, just being around Peyton and just seeing all the people that he's influenced, that, like, being at the party, like, seeing all these people that helped him become who he is, and everybody that was there to, like, see him and, like, support him, you know, go into the Hall of Fame, it was, like, it was incredible, man.</p><p>Like, it definitely motivated me to, like, you know, want to do the same thing, like, for me, and it really, it helped me believe, like, you know, I saw Peyton Manning do it, like, every single day, and that's the type of player that you have to be to make it there, so.</p><p>- Shoot, you on your way, fam. - It's great, man, I'm trying, man. I'm trying, man. It's 11 years in. To everybody, say, bro, I know you had a Vets come in and say, "Man, it go by fast." Like, it go by fast, it really does, and being, this is my 11th year in, I started playing golf, like, recently, and one of the sayings that we have in golf is don't forget to look up, 'cause you have some of these dope golf courses.</p><p>It could be at Pebble Beach, like, Shadow Creek, you know, Colorado Golf Club here in Colorado is dope, and you kind of forget to, like, look up. You know, you so in the motion of, like, putting and driving, and, you know, you're upset about the hit before, you're happy about the hit before, that you're just really thinking about golf, and you don't really, you know, you forget to look up, and this being my 11th year, like, I'm looking up, like, being in Denver, you know, being able to be in a city like this, like, going to the Niggas game, you know, fucking with y'all, like, hunting and fishing and golfing and doing, and being able to do all the things that make Denver, you know, what it is, man, it's been amazing.</p><p>- The balance, the balance, for sure. What year is this for you? This is your? - This is my third year. - This your third year? - This is my fourth year, no, this is my fourth year, but I was injured my first year, so. - You like Denver like that?</p><p>I know, man. - Nah, Denver, perfect for me, 'cause I don't know about you, but I mean, I know you be, you like to get it in, but I like-- - All right, what you doing? (laughs) - Well, I was at your Halloween party. I was up there, nah.</p><p>But I love it 'cause it's, like, chill, like, you can have fun, but you can also chill if you want to. So that's why it's perfect for me. I'm about to move, though. I ain't got no security around here. - Yeah, it's-- - Got robbed twice, boy. - Here?</p><p>- I just got it in my garage, but-- - Yeah, you gotta get, like, some get it, man. You gotta, when they know where you live, man, it'd be different, you know? - Yeah. So, but you're talking about that, like, looking up. I know, I know, obviously, you've influenced a lot of people football-wise.</p><p>You know, a lot of kids, you're an inspiration. But outside of football, like, as you get older, you have a kid. What do you kind of view as your purpose in life? - You know, for him, I just wanna, I just wanna support him. Like, my dad supported me.</p><p>My dad never made me, like, play football. My dad never made me, like, you know, really do anything but go to school and, like, do my homework and try to be the best student academically that I possibly can be. He never really made me or forced me to do anything.</p><p>And I just wanna do the same thing for him. I just wanna support him. I wanna be his biggest support system in anything that he does. You know, he could be, you know, a candle maker. You know, I'll just support him in that. You know, if he wanted to do filming or acting, like, I just wanna support him in whatever he does, just like my dad did for me.</p><p>- Yeah, that's dope. - I feel like that's one of my biggest purposes in life. You know, I just, you know, you wanna be a light. You know, you wanna be a light around people. You wanna influence people. You know, sometimes you get around people with different energies and you can just feel it, like, right off the top.</p><p>You never wanna be that guy. I just wanna, you know, influence and, you know, be a light to everybody that I fuck with. - Shoot, I mean, everybody that's on here is like, it's 'cause I respect 'em and, you know, we've linked up a couple times, seen you a couple times, but everybody around here who I've talked to is always a man, Von's the dopest dude ever.</p><p>Like, you gotta get him on there. He's so much more than a football player, so. - I appreciate that. - That's dope, yeah.

Both of those things are like, out of all the things that our world is like dealing with, like those are like two things that like, just like blow my mind, like. - Have you experienced a lot of racism? - You know, I have experienced racism, but I wouldn't say like I experienced it a lot.</p><p>Like not that, probably like that, I don't see, like I guess I'm so in like my bubble and like, you know what I'm doing, like I, you know, on a personal level, like, you know, I see it all, I see it, you know, you see it on TV, you can, I'm aware of it, it's happened to me like a couple of times, like you go overseas and like, people don't like, you're not like the same like Von Miller, like, you know, like what is football, you know?</p><p>- It's like a black dude. - Like, you know, some people know you, but some people just like, are totally like oblivious and like, you go over there and you just, you know, you a regular guy and you experience, you know, things that, that normal, like, you know, people that's not like, like entertainers or like sport athletes, cause you know, people, they treat you different, like, you know, you just a regular guy and you're able to experience it and you're able to relate on like, some of the serious things that's, you know, really happening in the world, man.</p><p>And like racism and global warming is two of the craziest things that I feel like I could say. - You like going overseas and kind of trying to become like a regular person for a little bit, blend in for a little bit? - I love, I love traveling, bro.</p><p>I love going overseas, bro, especially like Europe. I went to, we went on, we went on tour with Drake in 2000 and I think it was like 2017, the beginning of 2017, bro.

But we went to like Germany and went to all these different places like Amsterdam, Ireland, you know, and you experiencing like, you going on tour like with him. So you get to see it like in a different light, bro.</p><p>It was, it was amazing. It was really one of the top moments of my life. But at the same time, I was able to experience like some of these things that you wouldn't normally experience. - Right. - Like racism and all that type of stuff. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p><p>- Yeah. - Shoot, man.
