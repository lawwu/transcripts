and actionable science-based tools for mental health, physical health, and performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=10" target="_blank">00:00:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=17" target="_blank">00:00:17.220</a></span> | <span class="t">This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=21" target="_blank">00:00:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Today, we're going to talk about and focus on skill learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">We are going to focus on how to learn skills more quickly, in particular, motor skills.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're interested in how to perform better, whether or not it's dance or yoga or even something that's just very repetitive like running or swimming, this podcast episode is for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.460</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to go deep into the science of skill learning, and we are going to talk about very specific protocols that the science points to and has verified allow you to learn more quickly, to embed that learning so that you remember it, and to be able to build up skills more quickly than you would otherwise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's talk about the acquisition of new skills.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">These could be skills such as a golf swing or a tennis swing, or you're shooting free throws, or you're learning to dance, or you're learning an instrument.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm mainly going to focus on athletic performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.620</a></span> | <span class="t">There are basically two types of skills.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Open loop and closed loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Open loop skills are skills where you perform some sort of motor action, and then you wait and you get immediate feedback as to whether or not it was done correctly or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">A good example would be throwing darts at a dart board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you throw the dart, you get feedback about whether or not you hit the bullseye.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.680</a></span> | <span class="t">That's open loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Closed loop would be something that's more continuous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's say you're a runner, and you're starting to do some speed work and some sprints, and you're running, and you can kind of feel whether or not you're running correctly or maybe even have a coach, and they're correcting your stride.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">That's closed loop, because as you go, you can adjust your behavior, and you can adjust the distance of your steps, or you can adjust your speed, or you can adjust your posture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You're getting feedback on a moment-to-moment basis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.580</a></span> | <span class="t">There are essentially three components of any skill that involves motor movement, and those are sensory perception, actually perceiving what you are doing and what's happening around you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Then there are the actual movements, and then there's something called proprioception, and proprioception is often discussed as kind of a sixth sense of knowing where your limbs are in relation to your body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, skill learning has a lot of other dimensions, too, but those are the main ones that we're going to focus on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So anytime we learn something, we have to decide, is it open loop or closed loop?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.940</a></span> | <span class="t">The second question should be, what should I focus my attention on?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Auditory attention, visual attention, or proprioception.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Should I focus on where my limbs are relative to my body, or should I focus on the outcome?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, this is a critical distinction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You can decide to learn how to do a golf swing or a dance tango, and decide that you are going to focus on the movements of your partner, or the positions of your feet, or maybe you're going to sense the position and posture of your body, which is more proprioceptive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so you have to allocate your attention, and I'm going to tell you how to allocate your attention best in order to learn faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So these are the sorts of decisions that you have to make.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can really simplify things now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've given you a lot of information, but we can simplify it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, open loop or closed loop, that's one question, and what am I going to focus on?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And then your neurology will take care of the rest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So now I want to talk about realistic expectations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Somewhere in Hollywood, presumably, it got embedded in somebody's mind that instant skill acquisition was possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That you could take a particular pill, and you would suddenly have a skill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And I love movies, but it simply doesn't exist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Then the self-help literature created another rule called the 10,000 hours rule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And frankly, that doesn't really match the literature, at least the scientific literature, either.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I like it because it implies that learning takes time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But the 10,000 hours rule overlooks something crucial, which is that it's not about hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It's about repetitions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, of course, there's a relationship between time and repetitions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But there are some beautiful experiments that point to the fact that by simple adjustment of what you are focused on as you attempt to learn a new skill, you can adjust the number of repetitions that you do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You adjust your motivation for learning, you can vastly accelerate learning, some of you may recognize this by its internet name, which is not a scientific term, which is the Super Mario effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">The Super Mario effect relates to the game Super Mario Brothers, but you'll see why at the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically what they did was they had 50,000 subjects, which is an enormous number of subjects, learn a program, essentially taking words from a computer program or the commands for a computer program that were kind of clustered in a column on the right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And those commands are essentially, they essentially translate to things like, you know, go forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if it's a right-hand turn in the maze, then go right and continue until you hit a choice point, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a bunch of instructions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But the job of the subjects in these experiments were to organize those instructions in a particular way that would allow a little cursor to move through the maze successfully.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It takes some skill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to know what commands to give in what particular order.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And they made that very easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.780</a></span> | <span class="t">You could just assemble them in a list over onto the right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, there were two groups and some one half of the subjects, if they got it wrong, meaning they entered a command and the cursor would move and it was the wrong command for this little cursor to move through the maze.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">They saw a signal jump up on their screen that said, that did not work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Please try again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The subjects would reorganize the instructions and then the little cursor would continue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And if they got it wrong again, it would say that did not work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Please try again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The other half of the subjects, if they got something wrong, we're told you just lost five points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Please continue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the only difference in the feedback that they got.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I have to confess, I would have predicted based on my knowledge of dopamine circuitry and reward contingency, people will work much harder to prevent losing something than they will to gain something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If they looked at the success rate of the subjects, what they found was that the subjects that were told that did not work, please try again, had a 68% success rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">68% of them went on to successfully program this cursor moving through the maze, whereas the ones that were told you lost five points had a 52% success rate, which is a significant difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But the source of the source of the success rate of the subject of the subject that did not work, please try again, tried many, many more times per unit time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, they made more attempts at programming this thing to allow this cursor to move through the maze.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas the people that were told you lost five points gave up earlier or gave up entirely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">To me, this was very surprising.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It violates a lot of things that I had heard in the kind of popular culture or the self-help literature that people will work much harder to avoid losing something than they will to gain something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But it did fit well with another set of experiments that I'm very familiar with from the neuroscience literature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So the experiment that I want to tell you about is called the tube test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's the experiment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.900</a></span> | <span class="t">You take two rats, you put them in a tube or two mice, you put them in a tube and mice and rats, they don't like to share the same tube.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So what they'll do is they'll start pushing each other back and forth, back and forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Sooner or later, one of the rats or mice pushes the other one out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now you take the winner, you give it a new competitor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And what you find is that the mouse or rat that won previously has a much higher than chance probability of winning the second time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.860</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, winning before leads to winning again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Three years ago, there was a paper published that examined the brain area that's involved in this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Turns out it's a particular area of the frontal cortex, for those of you that want to know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And they did a simple experiment where they, the experimenters increased or decreased the activity of this brain area in the prefrontal cortex, a little sub region of the prefrontal cortex.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And what they found is if they stimulated this brain area, a mouse or rat, regardless of whether or not it had been a winner or loser before, became a winner every single time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So what is this magic brain area?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So what is this magic brain area?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">What is it doing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the reason I'm bringing this up today and the reason I'm bringing it up on the heels of the Super Mario effect is that stimulation of this brain area had a very simple and very important effect, which was it led to more forward steps, more repetitions, more effort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But not in terms of sheer might and will not digging deeper, just more repetitions per unit time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So the Super Mario effect, this online experiment and the tube test, which has been done by various labs and repeated again and again, point to a simple, but very important rule, which is neither the 10,000 hours rule nor the magic wand Hollywood version of learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But rather the neurobiological explanation for learning a skill is you want to perform as many repetitions per unit time as you possibly can, at least when you're first trying to learn a skill, the winners are always generating more repetitions per unit time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just a repeat of performance, repeat of performance, even if there are errors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And that points to something vitally important, which is reps are important, but making error reps is also important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, it might be the most important factor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's talk about errors and why those solve the problem of what to focus on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Because as I said earlier, if you want to learn something, you need to know if it's open loop or closed loop, and you need to know what to focus on, where to place your perception.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And that seems like a tough task, but errors will tell you exactly what to focus on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason is that the errors actually cue your nervous system to two things, one, to error correction, and the other is it opens the door or the window for neuroplasticity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Errors tell your nervous system that something needs to change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you are performing a task or a skill, like you're learning how to dance and you're stepping on the other person's toes, or you're fumbling, or you're not getting it right, those errors are opening the possibility for plasticity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">If you walk away at that point, you've made the exact wrong choice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Without errors, the brain is not in a position to change itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Errors actually cue the frontal cortex networks, what we call top-down processing, and the neuromodulators, things like dopamine and acetylcholine and epinephrine, that will allow for plasticity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So these errors cue the brain that something was wrong, and they open up the possibility for plasticity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">It's what's sometimes called the framing effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It frames what's important, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.220</a></span> | <span class="t">This isn't about motivation to learn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">This is about how you actually learn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So the key is, designate a particular block of time that you are going to perform repetitions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Work for time, and then try and perform the maximum number of repetitions that you can do safely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.300</a></span> | <span class="t">That's going to be the best way to approach learning for most sessions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I will talk about other things that one can do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But making errors is key.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And this isn't a motivational speech.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not saying, oh, go make errors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Errors are good for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to fail in order to win.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">No.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to fail in order to open up the possibility of plasticity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But you have to fail many times within the same session.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And those failures will cue your attention to the appropriate sensory events.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So science points to the fact that there's a particular sequencing of learning sessions that will allow you to learn faster and to retain the skill learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And it involves doing exactly as I just described, which is getting as many repetitions as you can in the learning session, paying attention to the errors that you make, and then the rewards that will be generated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, these are neurochemical rewards, from the successful performance of a movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And then after the session, you need to do something very specific, which is nothing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">After a skill learning session, there's a replay of the motor sequence that you performed correctly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's an elimination of the motor sequences that you performed incorrectly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so to be very clear about this, after I finish the training session, if I do nothing, if I just sit there and close my eyes for five to 10 minutes, even one minute, the brain starts to replay the motor sequence in a way that appears important for the more rapid consolidation of the motor sequence of the pattern and to accelerated learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have this basic learning session and then a period of time afterwards in which the brain can rehearse what it just did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">At the beginning of learning any skill, and as we approach from uncertain to skilled to mastery, we want to reduce uncertainty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's really what the nervous system is doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's trying to eliminate errors and hone in on the correct trajectories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=900" target="_blank">00:15:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">If you perform a lot of repetitions and then you use a period immediately after, we don't really have a name for this post-learning kind of idle time for the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">The brain isn't idle at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It's actually scripting all these things in reverse that allow for deeper learning and more quick learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But if we fill that time with other things, if we are focused on our phones or we're focused on learning something else, we're focusing on our performance, that's not going to serve us well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">At least it's not going to serve the skill learning well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So please, if you're interested in more rapid skill learning, try introducing these sessions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">They can be quite powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But once you're familiar with something and you're performing it well every once in a while, you're accomplishing it better every once in a while, then you can start to cue your attention in very deliberate ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we hear a lot about chunking, about breaking things down into their component parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of the biggest challenges for skill learning is knowing where to place your attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So to dial out again, we're building a protocol across this episode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Early sessions, maybe it's the first one, maybe it's the first 10.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But during those initial sessions, the key is to make many errors, to let the reward process govern the plasticity, let the errors open the plasticity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

gain some skill level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Learning to harness and focus your attention on particular features of the movement, independent of the rewards and the feedback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So the reward is no longer whether or not you struck the target correctly, but simply the motor movement focusing your, for instance, in a dart throw on the action of your arm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">That is embedding the plasticity and the motor pattern most deeply.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what's been shown by the scientific literature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're breaking the learning process down into its component parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">As we get more and more skilled, meaning as we make fewer and fewer errors per a given session, per unit time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that's when attention can start to migrate from one feature, such as the motor sequence, to another feature, which is perhaps one's stance and another sequence component of the sequence, which would be the result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">That's when getting on a trial to trial basis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of you may be wondering about speed of movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">There are some data, meaning some decent papers out there showing that ultra slow movements, performing a movement essentially in slow motion can be beneficial for enhancing the rate of skill learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">However, at least from my read of the literature, it appears that ultra slow movements should be performed after some degree of proficiency has already been gained in that particular movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that's not the way I would have thought about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1078" target="_blank">00:17:58.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I would have thought, well, you know, if you're learning how to do a proper kick or a punch in martial arts or something that ultra slow movements at first are going to be the way that one can, you know, best learn how to perform a movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you just gradually increase the speed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And it turns out that's not the case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1094" target="_blank">00:18:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I probably should have known that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And you should probably know that because it turns out that when you do ultra slow movements, two things aren't available to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">One is the proprioceptive feedback is not accurate because fast movements of limbs are very different than slow movements of limbs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So you don't get the opportunity to build in the proprioceptive feedback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But the other reason why it doesn't work is that it's too accurate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.020</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't generate errors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the data that I was able to find showed that very slow movements can be beneficial if one is already proficient in a practice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1132" target="_blank">00:18:52.220</a></span> | <span class="t">When should you start to introduce slow learning?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1135" target="_blank">00:18:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it appears that once you're hitting success rates of about 25 or 30%, that's where the super slow movements can start to be beneficial.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're still performing things at a rate of, you know, five or 10% correct and the rest are errors, then the super slow movements are probably not going to benefit you that much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1154" target="_blank">00:19:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, super slow movements are not really applicable to a lot of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1158" target="_blank">00:19:18.540</a></span> | <span class="t">For instance, you could imagine throwing a dart, super slow motion, but if you actually try and throw an actual dart, the dart's just going to fall to the floor, obviously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1167" target="_blank">00:19:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of you already have a fair degree of proficiency, of skill in a given practice or sport or instrument.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you're in this sort of advanced intermediate or advanced levels of proficiency for something, there is a practice that you can find interesting data for in the literature, which involves metronoming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So this you'll realize relates to generating repetitions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1197" target="_blank">00:19:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">You can use a metronome to set the cadence of your repetitions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1201" target="_blank">00:20:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you do that, what athletes find is they can perform more repetitions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">They can generate more output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You can increase speed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1208" target="_blank">00:20:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">A number of really interesting things are being done with auditory metronoming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1212" target="_blank">00:20:12.220</a></span> | <span class="t">There are actually some wild experiments out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there's a world championship of cup stacking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a young lady who I saw could take all these cups spread out on a table and basically just stack them into the perfect pyramid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And the least amount of times all the kids go wild.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1225" target="_blank">00:20:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">This is something I've never thought to pursue and frankly, never will pursue unless my life depends on it for some reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1231" target="_blank">00:20:31.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's really impressive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1233" target="_blank">00:20:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you look at the sequence, because these have been recorded, you can look this up on YouTube, what you'll find is that these expert cup stackers, it's just all about error elimination, but there too, metronoming and auditory cues can actually cue them to pick up the cups faster than they would ordinarily and to learn to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, what's interesting about this and is cool is that your attention is now harnessed to the tone, to the metronome, not necessarily to what you're doing in terms of the motor movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so really you need a bit of proficiency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, this is for people who are intermediate or advanced, intermediate or advanced, but what you're essentially doing is you're creating an outside pressure, a contingency, so that you generate again, more errors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's all about the errors that you get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1279" target="_blank">00:21:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you harness your attention to this outside contingency, this metronome that's firing off and saying, now go, now, go, now, go, not only can you increase the number of repetitions, errors and successes, but for some reason, and we don't know why, the regular cadence of the tone of the metronome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And the fact that you are anchoring your movements to some external force, to some external pressure or cue seems to accelerate the plasticity and the changes and the acquisition of skills beyond what it would be if you just did the same number of repetitions without that outside pressure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1315" target="_blank">00:21:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's talk about visualization and mental rehearsal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been asked about this a lot and I think it relates back to that kind of a matrix Hollywood idea that we can just be embedded with a skill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1329" target="_blank">00:22:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But the question we're going to deal with today is, does it help?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1333" target="_blank">00:22:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Does it let you learn things faster?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1335" target="_blank">00:22:15.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And indeed the answer appears to be, yes, it can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1339" target="_blank">00:22:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">However, despite what you've heard, it is not as good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It is not a total replacement for physical performance itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1350" target="_blank">00:22:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so I'm going to be really concrete about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1352" target="_blank">00:22:32.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I hear all the time that just imagining contracting a muscle can lead to the same gains as actually contracting that muscle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1361" target="_blank">00:22:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Just imagining a skill can lead to the same increases in performance as actually executing that skill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's simply not the case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">However, it can supplement or support physical training and skill learning in ways that are quite powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically, and thinking about a particular sequence of movement and visualizing it in one's quote-unquote mind's eye creates activation of the upper motor neurons that's very similar, if not the same, as the actual movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And that makes sense because the upper motor neurons are all about the command for movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">They are not the ones that actually execute the movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1405" target="_blank">00:23:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember, upper motor neurons are the ones that generate the command for movement, not the actual movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1410" target="_blank">00:23:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The ones that generate the actual movement are the lower motor neurons and the central pattern generators.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So the point is, if you want to use visualization training, great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1419" target="_blank">00:23:39.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But forget the idea that

class="t">And the fact of the matter is that the brain, when it executes movement, is generating proprioceptive feedback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1449" target="_blank">00:24:09.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And that proprioceptive feedback is critically involved in generating our sense of

enough to focus your attention and to perform a lot of repetitions in the training sequence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1496" target="_blank">00:24:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">That's just a prerequisite, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1498" target="_blank">00:24:58.820</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no pill that's going to allow you to do fewer repetitions and extract more learning out of fewer repetitions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's actually more a question of what are the conditions that you can create for yourself such that you can generate more repetitions per unit time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1512" target="_blank">00:25:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's the right way to think about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1513" target="_blank">00:25:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">What are the conditions that you can create for yourself in your mind and in your body that are going to allow you to focus?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1518" target="_blank">00:25:18.840</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a few compounds that I think are worth mentioning because of their ability to improve the actual physical performance, the actual execution of certain types of movements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1531" target="_blank">00:25:31.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And some of these have also been shown to improve cognitive function, especially in older populations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1537" target="_blank">00:25:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'd be remiss if I didn't at least mention them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1539" target="_blank">00:25:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm only going to mention one today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1541" target="_blank">00:25:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, the one that's particularly interesting and for which there really are a lot of data is alpha GPC.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1547" target="_blank">00:25:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm going to attempt to pronounce what alpha GPC actually is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1553" target="_blank">00:25:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's alpha glycerophosphocholine, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1556" target="_blank">00:25:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Alpha GPC, alpha glycerophosphocholine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1559" target="_blank">00:25:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">See, if I keep doing it over and over repetitions, alpha glycerophosphocholine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.500</a></span> | <span class="t">There, I made an error.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1564" target="_blank">00:26:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so the point is that alpha GPC, which is at least in the United States, is sold over the counter, typically is taken in dosages of about 300 to 600 milligrams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a single dose or have been shown to do a number of things that for some of you might be beneficial.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.820</a></span> | <span class="t">One is to enhance power output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1585" target="_blank">00:26:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're engaging in something like resistance training or sprinting or something where you have to generate a lot of power,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1592" target="_blank">00:26:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">well then, in theory, alpha GPC could be beneficial to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1596" target="_blank">00:26:36.460</a></span> | <span class="t">A study noted a 14% increase in power output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1600" target="_blank">00:26:40.380</a></span> | <span class="t">That's pretty substantial, you know, 14% if you think about it, but it wasn't like a doubling or something of that sort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1606" target="_blank">00:26:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So as you can see, things like alpha GPC, in particular, when they are combined with low levels of caffeine, can have these effects of improving power output, can improve growth hormone release, can improve fat oxidation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1620" target="_blank">00:27:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">All these things, in theory, can support skill learning, but what they're really doing is they're adjusting the foundation upon which you are going to execute these many, many repetitions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1630" target="_blank">00:27:10.700</a></span> | <span class="t">The same thing would be said for caffeine itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1633" target="_blank">00:27:13.940</a></span> | <span class="t">If that's something that motivates you and gets you out of a chair to actually do the physical training, then that's something that can perhaps improve or enhance the rate of skill learning and how well you retain those skills.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1646" target="_blank">00:27:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, on a previous episode, I talked about, and this was the episode on epinephrine, on adrenaline, I talked about how for mental, for cognitive learning, it makes sense to spike epinephrine, to bump epinephrine levels up, adrenaline levels up after cognitive learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1666" target="_blank">00:27:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">For physical learning, it appears to be the opposite, that if you are, if caffeine is in your practice, or if you decide to try alpha GPC, that you would want to do that before the training, take it before the training, use it, its effects should extend into the training, presumably throughout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1682" target="_blank">00:28:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of the questions I get are about how different protocols and things that I describe start to collide with one another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1688" target="_blank">00:28:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's say, for instance, you go to bed at 10:30 and you're going to do your skill training at 9:30, well, taking a lot of caffeine then is not going to be a good idea because it's going to compromise your sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1700" target="_blank">00:28:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm not here to design the perfect schedule for you because everyone's situations vary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1706" target="_blank">00:28:26.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So the things to optimize are repetitions, failures, more repetitions, more failures at the offset of training, having some idle time that could be straight into sleep, or it could be simply letting the brain just go idle for five to 10 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1724" target="_blank">00:28:44.260</a></span> | <span class="t">That's me not focusing on anything, not scrolling social media, not emailing, not ideally, not even talking to somebody, just lying down or sitting quietly with your eyes closed, letting those motor sequences replay, use things like metronoming, where you're cueing your attention to some external cue, some stimulus, in this case, an auditory stimulus, most likely, and trying to generate more repetitions per unit time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1745" target="_blank">00:29:05.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So you now are armed with a lot of information about how you generate movement, and I like to think that you're also armed with a lot of information about how to design protocols that are optimized for you, or if you're a coach, for your trainees, in order to optimize their learning of skills of various kinds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1767" target="_blank">00:29:27.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And I should say that for those of you that are short on time or have limited amounts of time, 10 minutes of maximum repetitions, maximum focus skill learning work is going to be very beneficial.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1778" target="_blank">00:29:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really about the density of training inside of a session.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1781" target="_blank">00:29:41.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think you should let the, you know, work toward maximal or near maximal density of repetitions and failures provided their failures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1789" target="_blank">00:29:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You can perform safely in order to accelerate skill learning and don't let some arbitrary, or in this case, the ultradian constraint prevent you from engaging in that practice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1799" target="_blank">00:29:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, get the work in, get as much work done as you can per unit time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1802" target="_blank">00:30:02.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And based on the science, based on things that I've seen, based on things that I'm now involved in with various communities, you will see the skill improve vastly at various stages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1815" target="_blank">00:30:15.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes it's a little bit stutter start.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1816" target="_blank">00:30:16.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not always a linear improvement, but you will see incredible improvement in skill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEy78RL2YY&t=1821"
