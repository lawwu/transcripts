Thank you so much for having me again. Again. I know this is two times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=5" target="_blank">00:00:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">except now you have a book that is new. You've had books before. I'm a little jealous. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=10" target="_blank">00:00:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">working on one book. You've already got how many? Three. Three. Okay. But two are cookbooks and one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=15" target="_blank">00:00:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of the cookbooks is about popsicles. So maybe that's a half a book. It's a little baby book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=19" target="_blank">00:00:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So two and a half books. Two and a half books. All right. Well, this is a great one. I didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=23" target="_blank">00:00:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">have the previous books. I have this one. I got to read this one. And I'm really excited you're here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=28" target="_blank">00:00:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">because I think a lot of what your book's about is a lot of what my audience loves,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">which is finding tactical ways to improve your life across a bunch of verticals that you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">do without spending a fortune. A hundred percent. I feel like I read so many personal growth books</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=43" target="_blank">00:00:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'll read it and I'll kind of just get like a good warm feeling while I'm reading it. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I close the book and immediately I'm like, well, what do I actually do? I feel just like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">what next? What now? And I really wanted to create a book that answered that question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and that gave people the science behind the tools that they need and then the real tactical tips</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that they can apply today to change their lives. Yeah. So there's a hundred. We don't have time to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">get through all of them. I tried, by the way. Liz said, no, we have to limit it. We can't go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">through all hundred. I was just trying to make it a good use of your time and your audience's time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Well, if you want all the hundred, you can get the book. But what I thought is in the book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you break it into health, happiness, success and relationships. I almost got that wrong,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but I'm glad I didn't. And I wanted to run through each and just kind of talk about a few of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">things I pulled out and get you to dive a little deeper, share some of that science behind it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And if people want the rest, obviously there's a book we're not going to get through all hundred.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was trying to think of where to start and I don't really have a formula for where to start.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just pick success. I don't know why. I think I was moving things around in notion and I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like, and then I ended up with success at the beginning. So wait, I'm curious before we start,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">is there one of the four areas that you feel like you'd so the book was really designed to be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">resource that you would pick up at different points in your life. At one point, if your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">friendships need work, you'd pick it up and work on those tips. If one point your gut health needs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">work, you'd pick it up and read through those tips. I'm curious if any of those four areas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">immediately strikes you as one that resonates right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's funny because when I got to gut health, I was like, I don't really know enough about here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">about this whole topic. So I was like, OK, we're going to put that in the middle of this conversation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">because it doesn't strike me because I feel like it's an area I haven't gone deep on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Relationships is interesting because once you have kids, your relationships that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like used to see people all the time, they're kind of gone. So I and then you're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">my best friend is my neighbor because we don't have to go that far. And so I do have some thoughts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and I want to have a conversation about relationships because I think that evolves as you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">get a little older. I think I've spent a lot of time when I went through the success section,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I was like, gosh, I've done a few interviews in this space. So that was one that wasn't like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the biggest, biggest priority. And maybe happiness is somewhat in there, but there was still some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">great things. So I don't want to skip over it, like just because I just because it wasn't the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">one that resonated the most. But I would say strangely, relationships might resonate the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">most, which is maybe why I was like, let's end on that. Yeah, I like that. And it makes sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to is like a parent of two in the place you are in your life. I think that makes all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">sense in the world. OK, so success. Let's start with success. Yeah. So when it comes to goals</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and building habits, there is one part of the conversation that when it comes to goals and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">building habits, I want to talk about the fresh start effect because it maybe feels like a good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">fresh start for the conversation. Yeah. So this is from research from Dr. Katie Milkman. Katie</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Milkman is a podcast guest that I've had on. She's a behavioral scientist from Wharton at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">University of Pennsylvania, and she is probably the most cited guest by other guests. So other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">guests come on and they're like, oh, according to Dr. Katie Milkman's research, I love Katie</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Milkman. Katie Milkman's the best. And so when I finally got to interview Katie Milkman, I was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you have a fan club, like you have such a fan club. And she was incredible. And she's shared</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">so much research that I put into this book because she works on habits and goals and behavior change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And her stuff is so actionable in the moment. So the fresh start effect is really simple. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it's the idea that research shows that we view our life in this really narrative way. So we view</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">ourselves as like books and then different moments in our lives, different periods of our lives are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like chapters in a book. And when we turn the page and we can turn the page, start a new chapter by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">starting a new job, moving to a new house, New Year's Eve would be turning a huge page.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We feel like we're not the same person that we were the chapter before. And thus we're not stuck</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">with the same habits and behaviors that we had the chapter before. So it's really, really helpful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're trying to make behavior change to identify a fresh start in your life so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you can be like, OK, in the last house, I didn't work out. I didn't meditate. I didn't, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">get I was on my phone way too much. But now that I've moved in this new house, I'm not that same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">person anymore. I'm not going to have those same behaviors.

I've made the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">workout more appealing and I'm thus more likely to do it, to not procrastinate on it and to actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">get it done.

So I think self-imposed penalties, that's another bit of Dr. Melkman's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">research. We have an entire podcast with Dr. Melkman about habits and routines. I think it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">called something like how to get more in shape, save more money. It's like all these promises,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but the thing is that Dr. Melkman's research comes back to achieving anything you want to achieve in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">any part of your life. So the self-imposed penalties is really fun. That would be something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">as easy as like you signing up for a workout class that you have to pay for in advance that if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">cancel, you don't get your money back, you're significantly more likely, research shows,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to actually attend that workout class.

So knowing the way that our brain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">works can help us actually keep to stick to the things that we want to stick to in that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There's an awesome book called Happy Money. It's basically like five or six tips to use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">your money to be happier.

Both you commit to going, but at the end, you don't have to pay the bill. So you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">paid the bill in advance. When you're done, you're not like, "Oh, that was so... And I have to spend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this thing."

And there is... Do you know what girl math is? I don't. I didn't know math had a gender.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like a TikTok trend right now.

There are so many areas in our lives that we are limiting ourselves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that if we just went out and we looked for a no, we would likely get a yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you think you combat that with just being irrationally optimistic and convincing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">yourself that you can do anything when in reality some things maybe you can't?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that most of the most successful people that I know are irrationally optimistic.

If you're trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">write a book and you go out and you get 25 no's from agents, that's probably good information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You can ask them why the no.

So what about areas of life where there isn't a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">no to go get? For example, if you want to go start a podcast or start a blog, there's no no. You can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">just do it and you can keep doing it for years. How do you find out when to stop on something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that and say no to yourself? So the thing that I run into the most with my audience and with people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I talk to is not, "I've started a podcast.

So I would say I meet far less people who have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">honed their craft over years and years and years and not gotten to a place where the quality is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">good enough or better.

It was purely like, "I did this thing." Five seconds ago. Yeah. This is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=2089" target="_blank">00:34:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">strange example, but I was setting up auto insurance with USAA.

And then once I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=2099" target="_blank">00:34:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">did it all, I was like, "Hey, I didn't see the discounts." And they're like, "Yeah, they're just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=2102" target="_blank">00:35:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">going to come in three weeks."

And she's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=2105" target="_blank">00:35:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "Well, you just have to wait and see." I was like, "No, no, no.

So this is one of my favorite tips in the book. And I feel like it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3077" target="_blank">00:51:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit underappreciated as a tip. So I want to spotlight it for a second. But it's to let the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3082" target="_blank">00:51:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">people that you love change in front of you all of the time. To go into them, to go to the people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3089" target="_blank">00:51:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that you love with a fresh perspective as often as possible. So this could look like, "Oh, I know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3096" target="_blank">00:51:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you didn't like reading this type of book when we were first dating. Is that still true? Do you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3101" target="_blank">00:51:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">still not like reading this type of book?" I think we don't allow the people in our lives to change</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3108" target="_blank">00:51:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">while we're on this path towards change. And it doesn't make any sense. And so I think that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3115" target="_blank">00:51:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes we can turn those old relationships into really satisfying relationships in the present by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3121" target="_blank">00:52:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">allowing for that evolution in each other. Can the opposite happen? Can you realize that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3125" target="_blank">00:52:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this person that in high school I was best friends with and we said we were going to be friends</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3131" target="_blank">00:52:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">forever, it's not the right thing. Are you saying let it evolve and bring it back to that awesome?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3138" target="_blank">00:52:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Or is there also a place for... Or maybe it's just not... I think there's both. I think there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3143" target="_blank">00:52:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">both. So first of all, I'm a huge fan of at the point that you think a relationship might be over,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3149" target="_blank">00:52:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">have a conversation about what you would need from that relationship to have it not be over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3153" target="_blank">00:52:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">because at that point you have nothing to lose. Like if you're about to cut somebody out of your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3156" target="_blank">00:52:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">life or just stop hanging out with them or ghost them or whatever, like scale back entirely,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3161" target="_blank">00:52:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you have nothing to lose by saying, "Hey, Paul. I don't really want to talk about high school</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3165" target="_blank">00:52:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">whenever we hang out." Or, "Hey, Paul. I'm not really in a hanging out at the bar and drinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3170" target="_blank">00:52:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">beer phase of my life. I would really love if you would come over and play with my kids and we could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3175" target="_blank">00:52:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">sing Disney songs." And then even if Paul is like, "That sounds awful. Like I'm not interested in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3180" target="_blank">00:53:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that." You've lost nothing and there's a chance that Paul would be like, "Oh my gosh. I know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3185" target="_blank">00:53:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">every single word to the Beauty and the Beast soundtrack and nobody has asked me to sing it."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3189" target="_blank">00:53:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So I do think that having that conversation can have some really powerful results that we would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3196" target="_blank">00:53:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">not expect. And if you have nothing to lose, you have everything to gain by having that conversation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3200" target="_blank">00:53:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then two, I'm not a fan of cutting people out, but I am a fan of changing their position</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3205" target="_blank">00:53:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in my life. And I think that this can be really important especially when you're somebody with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3209" target="_blank">00:53:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">limited time. Instead of Paul being somebody you're really prioritizing, maybe Paul becomes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3214" target="_blank">00:53:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">"I see them at the Christmas gathering," friend. Maybe somebody goes from being middle of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3219" target="_blank">00:53:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">night secret friend to, "I go to yoga with them," friend. And I think being clear with ourselves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3225" target="_blank">00:53:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">about our expectations and what we're getting out of each friendship can be really helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3229" target="_blank">00:53:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so sometimes moving people along in those places can be a way to not cut them out entirely,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3234" target="_blank">00:53:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but to have them have a more right-sized presence in our life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3238" target="_blank">00:53:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. I feel like this has been awesome. We've knocked through enough things that I'm feeling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3243" target="_blank">00:54:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">really excited. One of the things I loved is the way you described the book wasn't,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3246" target="_blank">00:54:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">"You need to read all 100. You need to do all these right away." So I already feel like I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3251" target="_blank">00:54:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">a slate of things to work on and I feel like I've got some next steps and it's not the book that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3256" target="_blank">00:54:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you've read millions of times that leaves you unaware of what's next and feeling stuck. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3261" target="_blank">00:54:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">thank you.

Where can people go?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3264" target="_blank">00:54:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The book is called 100 Ways to Change Your Life.

One of the first tips in the book is about figuring out your needs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3294" target="_blank">00:54:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">your goals, and how you're going to measure success in terms of those needs and goals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3298" target="_blank">00:54:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's hugely important so that we don't end up with a ton of habits filling our day that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3303" target="_blank">00:55:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">we don't even know why they're there.

And then I have a podcast called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlAXLjyLJI&t=3307" target="_blank">00:55:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the Liz Moody Podcast, which you have been a guest on, a great, great episode.
