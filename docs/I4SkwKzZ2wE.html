So, you think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what if we just broke them in and they're not overlapping at all?

Now, it may seem obvious that a five-year bond would have a yield that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the starting yield matches its five-year return, but this works for other maturities, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I've done this for five-year, seven-year, ten-year.

So, duration risk is probably the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">next thing.

It's a number that's expressed in years because it basically tells you how long it'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">take to get your whole money back, right?

The good rule of thumb here is, the longer your maturity, the higher</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">your duration, and thus the more volatility you experience to changes in rates. So, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">other rule of thumb is, the decent approximation is, your duration will tell you how much your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.860</a></span> | <span class="t">bond will move relative to a 1% moving interest rate.

It's not worth it. Credit risk is the other one. So, if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">have corporate bonds or mortgage bonds or asset-backed bonds, you could have a downgrade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Why do bonds drop on a credit downgrade?

So, if you had a corporate bond that went from a high credit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">rating that was quality credit to high yield, a lot of ETFs and institutional investors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">probably can't hold those anymore if they have a mandate that they can't hold high-yield</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">bonds. So, default risk is the next one. The long-term default risk for a high-yield junk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">bond is 3-4%. You can't really take your yield and high yield and say, "I'm going to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that going forward." You have to kind of lop off some for default. Obviously, that number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">is different depending on the economic environment that we're in, but you should take that number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">into account when having those expectations. Finally, the last one is inflation risk. This</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is the biggie.

This is just to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">illustrate a point here. From 1946 to 1980, long-term government bonds in the U.S. returned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">about 2% per year nominally.

So, that means you lagged bigly on a real</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">basis.

On an inflation-adjusted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">basis, long-term bonds were down 60% from 1946 to 1980.

Rising rates, eventually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4SkwKzZ2wE&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you pick up those higher yields, and that'll kind of help you a little bit.
