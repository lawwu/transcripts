No? Okay, well, let's get right into the docket. First around the docket, Ron DeSantis,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=224">00:03:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Governor Ron DeSantis announced his bid on the internet on something called Twitter Spaces. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=230">00:03:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it looks like almost 10 million viewers have seen it so far across all the different spaces. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=237">00:03:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Donald Trump wasn't too pleased.

Truth. Because when Elon fired up the Twitter Spaces, it went to 650,000 viewers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=252">00:04:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in under five minutes, and then blew up everybody's phones. My phone was melting, I could have cooked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=257">00:04:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">an egg on the back of it. The Twitter app crashed so many times. But then Sachs, with his meager</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=262">00:04:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">following of a half million people or something, then restarted the stream. And so 15 minutes of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=269">00:04:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">technical snafus were relieved. And then there was a announcement. And I'll let you take it from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=276">00:04:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">there, Sachs.

How did it come together, Sachs? Oh, yeah, even better. Yeah, the way it came together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=287">00:04:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is I think the DeSantis team were interested in potentially, you know, doing something different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=292">00:04:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">for their announcement. He also did an appearance on Fox News afterwards. And I think he did a town</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=297">00:04:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">hall. But I think they saw an opportunity to break new ground here in terms of presidential</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=302">00:05:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">announcements by doing it on Twitter Spaces. And so the DeSantis campaign connected with Twitter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=309">00:05:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And Elon and I agreed to kind of co-host the space with him. And he did his announcement. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=316">00:05:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you're right, we had about 15 minutes of technical difficulties, because the interest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=320">00:05:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">was so intense. At the time, the room crashed, it had over 700,000 people in it. And there were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=326">00:05:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it crashed because so many people were trying to get in it. I think there was well over a million</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=329">00:05:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">people trying to get in it. So you normally don't have this kind of interest. I think this is by far</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=335">00:05:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the biggest Twitter space.

And then you combine that with the fact that Elon's account</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=345">00:05:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">has over 100 million followers.

So in any event, the engineers were there trying to figure out how do we solve this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=361">00:06:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And we realized the simplest thing to do would just be to restart the room on my account instead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=365">00:06:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of Elon's. And then Elon joins a co-host and we brought DeSantis in. And it all worked perfectly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=370">00:06:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">at that point. The audio was brisk. We had over 300,000 people in the room. There was also another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=377">00:06:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">room that had been set up by Mario Nawal, who's like a big Twitter spaces host. And he had hundreds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=384">00:06:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of thousands of people in there. And then he had live commentary from people he invited. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=389">00:06:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this ability to fork Twitter spaces into many different rooms, and each room gets to decide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=394">00:06:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">who they want to be their host and their speakers, allows you to do live commentary and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=399">00:06:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in a way that you could never have done before. So it was really innovative, I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=403">00:06:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Super innovative.

So I think it was really, really an important moment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=529">00:08:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">for citizen journalism, and podcasting and audio formats and all of the things that I think we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=537">00:08:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">been a small part of.

And you can see that in Biden's tweet. Yeah, going direct. Yeah. So that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=549">00:09:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">was the first thing. Second thing. I think DeSantis did a really decent job in rolling with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=554">00:09:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the whole thing and being super cool and just being committed to the process. And I think that says a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=560">00:09:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">lot about him as well, which was again, it's a question mark. And I've said this before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=564">00:09:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the big money guys got close and then took a step back. So this could be a very good moment for them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=571">00:09:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to reevaluate because I thought he did a very good job. So I agree. So you know, I was there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=575">00:09:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I was live, I was seeing what was happening behind the scenes. When DeSantis came on after we,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=579">00:09:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, had 15 minutes of technical difficulties. There wasn't a hint of anger,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=584">00:09:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">there wasn't a trace of irritation, there wasn't any freaking out that we were potentially ruining</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=590">00:09:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">his presidential announcement, the guy was completely calm. And more than that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=594">00:09:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">he was in good spirits. I mean, if you listen to the recording, you know, he's happy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=600">00:10:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">His tone was great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=601">00:10:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">His tone was really good. I mean, and then of course, it was very substantive. He spoke</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=605">00:10:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">in a very articulate way about all the issues. When Congressman Thomas Massie came on to make a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=611">00:10:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">comment or question, he was telling a kind of amusing anecdote about when they were in Congress</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=615">00:10:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">together. And Massie was one of the only members of Congress who had a Tesla, but he comes from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=622">00:10:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Kentucky. So I think his license plate said Kentucky coal on it. KY coal. So anyway, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=628">00:10:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the guy was in good spirits. And so I think it does say a lot about what he would be like as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=633">00:10:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">president, cool under fire, doesn't get thrown off his game. You know, again, not an angry guy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=638">00:10:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, which I think will be a real contrast with let's say some of the other people in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=642">00:10:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">race. You know, Trump was sort of angrily truthing during the whole thing, you know, so I think it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=648">00:10:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">was a pretty strong contrast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=650">00:10:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Truthing the act of posting to Truth Social.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=652">00:10:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly. So the contrast between the personalities could not have been stronger.

It's not, it's not even on the radar. freeberg, we heard all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=819">00:13:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">positive here. Any constructive feedback on it or thoughts on it generally? No, I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=826">00:13:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I would love to see all the political candidates engage in long form discussion like this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=832">00:13:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">so that an audience can really get a sense of who they are and what they think in a direct way and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=838">00:13:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">an uninterrupted way. And in a deeper way, sort of like the conversation we all had with RFK last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=844">00:14:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">week and sacked it with DeSantis yesterday.

I think one of the saddest commentaries on modern democracy is that you can spend $1 to buy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=864">00:14:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a vote, that all of these campaigns functionally try and raise capital to go and do advertising</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=871">00:14:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and that the advertising creates these little 30 second soundbites that actually change people's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=876">00:14:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">opinions.

So yeah, look, I mean, I think that's generally the positive trend that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=962">00:16:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that I took away from it. Jake, what do you think?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=964">00:16:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I have some notes for Saks.

But I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=978">00:16:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">everything said so far, this tweak the media, a great start. The thing that I think was there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=985">00:16:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">were probably one or two misses here that I think you can build on Saks since you're very involved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=990">00:16:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in the campaign with DeSantis. I think it wasn't the free for all that Elon had said it would have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=998">00:16:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">been right. So he pitched it as like, hey, this is going to be uncensored. And everybody's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1003">00:16:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to get to ask hard questions. And that didn't happen. And you know, I think that is in stark</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1008">00:16:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">contrast to what Trump did, because I was doing the media analysis of this. And so I think the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1013">00:16:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">follow up needs to be where he actually takes questions, not from fans, not from people who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1018">00:16:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">are already voting for him, but really, you know, a little bit more of the cantankerous people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1023">00:17:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the people who maybe are voting for Trump, the people who are maybe in the biting camp. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1028">00:17:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that's what was the masterstroke Trump's CNN town hall, he went into the, you know, the lions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1035">00:17:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">then or what most people perceive was going to be the lions then. And he took on all comers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1040">00:17:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">he fought hard. And that one was, I think, a bigger win. I don't think DeSantis</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1045">00:17:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">was not a presidential announcement. So just to be clear, yes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1048">00:17:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this was a launch event declaring that he's running. So in that context,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1052">00:17:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, so you want to compare it to what these things usually are, which is a guy standing at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1056">00:17:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">a podium. Yes, in front of his supporters. Compared to that, this was much more interesting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1062">00:17:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">dynamic and engaging. I agree with you that at some point, he's going to step into the lions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1066">00:17:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">den do a town hall on a place like CNN. And I think he probably will. In fact, I think he did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1070">00:17:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think he did a town hall or here. I think he actually did a town hall in Florida</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1074">00:17:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">later that night. So yeah, I agree with you. It just wasn't that kind of event. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1079">00:17:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to the point about involving more people, you know, one of the things I learned hosting this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1084">00:18:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">thing is there were literally 1000s of people raising their hands. Yes, you can't start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1088">00:18:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">scrolling through this in real time in the app. I wanted to call them more people. But it was just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1094">00:18:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">there was no way to do it. This is something at scale, they need to add to the interface, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1099">00:18:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe pre populating a list, sorting it by the number of followers, whatever. And this is my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1103">00:18:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">second point about this. So I agree with you. As an announcement, this was light speed ahead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1107">00:18:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">as like a full court, you know, like sharp elbow thing. It didn't hit that note, but it can. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1112">00:18:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that's what I think the follow up, you know, having if to Santa's wants to come here and have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1115">00:18:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">like a two hour discussion, we kind of get into it a little more, that would be I think, really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1119">00:18:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">good for him. Because I think he's got the potential to win over moderates. And I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1123">00:18:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">think this one over moderates didn't win over anybody who was in, you know, the left or in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1129">00:18:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">moderate left. And that was one of the things I noticed is my second point about it is what a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1133">00:18:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">great group of listeners, if you look at who showed up to listen, Bill Ackman, Michael Dell,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1142">00:19:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">because you know, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1142">00:19:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">already see you know, you want you sourced by your followers. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1145">00:19:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">but I think it's sorted by the number of followers they have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1148">00:19:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it's sorted by your followers who then have the most followers. So you're gonna see it's a bit of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1152">00:19:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">a echo chamber that way. Okay, feature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1155">00:19:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, sure. But they were still very prominent people in the room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1160">00:19:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Prominent people follow you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1161">00:19:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, but they weren't coming to follow me. They were coming to listen to this. My point is still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1166">00:19:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the same. Michael Dell, Bill Ackman were coming. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1168">00:19:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but that's why you saw them because they're your followers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1170">00:19:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I we all understand that. They still showed up for this in the middle of the day. I think that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1174">00:19:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is really interesting. And that Yeah, yeah, that's, yeah, that's all my point is, it's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1179">00:19:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting that powerful people showed up for it. Full stop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1181">00:19:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Saks. I have a question for you.

And then I just had a couple of other ones. Elon was a bit underutilized in this format.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1188">00:19:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's, you know, a challenge when you have Elon in the room, because people want to ask</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1193">00:19:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Elon questions.

I heard a lot of back channel from important people, like I wanted to Elon ask a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1212">00:20:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">question, or maybe the two of them get into it. So for a follow up one, getting some people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1216">00:20:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, who maybe don't traditionally get to ask questions, because let's face it in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1221">00:20:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">traditional media, the only people get to ask questions are these anchors on news channels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1225">00:20:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to hear Michael Dow or Bill Ackman ask a question.

I just couldn't manage it. There was just so many people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1238">00:20:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in the room.

But I didn't see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1241">00:20:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the only criticism people had of you, Saks is you're a major donor and you stack the deck was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1245">00:20:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the most cynical version of it with like, five people who were just super effusive. But this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1250">00:20:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">his launch party. So I think in that context, I would have called on Bill Ackman if I known he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1256">00:20:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">wanted to speak, but I can't see whether he raised his hand or not. No, I didn't see him in the room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1259">00:20:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I was just do call on Bill Ackman.

When I put it in our group chat,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1293">00:21:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Saks was like he is.

They also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1307">00:21:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">reached out to me about it.

Can I ask a follow up question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1315">00:21:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">just on the dissent is thing himself because you've seen him up close.

Yeah, yeah, I don't I don't know him. But I did see a press</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1339">00:22:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">article and he was referencing book bannings. So that to me just showed that he was buying into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1346">00:22:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">some, you know, crazy left wing. I think that was the best part of the discussion. I asked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1351">00:22:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">us about that. So by the way, for people, one thing that was new news for a lot of people was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1357">00:22:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the book banning. Can you explain the issue and the spin and the clarification on book banning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1363">00:22:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in Florida? It's very simple. They haven't banned any books in Florida. But the question is what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1368">00:22:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">books are taught in the curriculum, and what's in the school library. And some of these books were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1374">00:22:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">positively pornographic. I mean, they had someone to Santa's had an event where somebody was actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1379">00:22:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">reading what was in these books. And the mere reading of what was in the books actually got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1385">00:23:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">labeled on social media by the algorithms. So there was a lot of stuff that's just not appropriate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1391">00:23:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">for kids. No one is restricting your ability to buy or read whatever books you want in the state</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1395">00:23:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of Florida is ridiculous. There's a legitimate question about what's in the curriculum. By the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1401">00:23:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">way, I remember when we had debates on campus about this is back a long time ago, like late 80s,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1407">00:23:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">early 90s, when they were throwing dead white males out of the curriculum, you know, Plato,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1411">00:23:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Aristotle, Shakespeare, people like that. The people on the right who were opposing that never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1417">00:23:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">made the argument that this was censorship. Everybody understands that when you're dealing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1421">00:23:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">with a curriculum, you have to make choices, you can't teach everything. So the question is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1426">00:23:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">what are you going to limit it to? And I think that when people actually dug into some of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1430">00:23:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">books, they realize that they're not appropriate. So in any event, his answer was along those lines</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1436">00:23:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that, you know, you should go listen to it for yourself. But I think that he did address</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1441">00:24:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that issue. I think he's kind of exposed it as a, you know, left wing media narrative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1447">00:24:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think he deconstructed it. And I think that was helpful, because I think there are a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1451">00:24:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">centrists who all they've heard about DeSantis is that he's banning books or, you know, or the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1457">00:24:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Disney issue, which we also asked him about. And we covered that, I think. So yeah, the Yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1463">00:24:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we talked about some of these controversies. The issue here, just to summarize, it is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1468">00:24:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the left is framing the banning, quote, unquote, but just the not inclusion of certain books,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1476">00:24:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">which are graphic that have sex in them, from certain age groups, in schools as part of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1481">00:24:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">curriculum. So they're saying these books are banned in Florida, the more accurate way to say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1486">00:24:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it is, these books are not being used in curriculum. You know, for these age groups,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1492">00:24:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">parents, if they want to buy them, can buy them, and then can read them. So this is where this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1496">00:24:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">conversation is kind of breaking down. And I think is a complete waste of time. All parents want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1501">00:25:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">control over at what age or what stuff their kids are exposed to. And so there is a thoughtful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1507">00:25:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">discussion to be had there. And maybe the discussion is, this is something parents should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1510">00:25:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">decide, right? Yeah, of course, but it's not a conversation. It's a hoax. It's a it's a fake</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1515">00:25:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">media narrative. They're trying to pin on him. And DeSantis has been the subject and victim</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1520">00:25:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of these types of fake media narratives, which are deliberate, the media is not trying to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1524">00:25:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a conversation. They're trying to disqualify the guy.

So what Biden could do is he could say the 14th amendment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1881">00:31:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">gives me the right, I'm going to pass a budget via executive order.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1885">00:31:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">From a game theory perspective, what that does is it forces Republicans to sue Biden,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1891">00:31:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">take him to the Supreme Court and say this is unconstitutional.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1895">00:31:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">The problem with that is that that probably really does tank the economy in the way that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1901">00:31:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it creates enough uncertainty where capital markets freeze up and liquidity just absolutely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1906">00:31:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">goes away.

Now, if the 14th amendment turns out to be a reasonable way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1926">00:32:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in order to pass a budget, the good news is not just for Biden, but for any future president,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1931">00:32:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">including Republican presidents will not have to be held hostage by Congress.

I mean, it's true that the 14th amendment has some language about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1968">00:32:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">full faith and credit of the US shall not be compromised.

First of all, one of the points I'd make is, I think you're probably right in your assessment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3158">00:52:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that 50 cents, that's what you're calling wasted that money does end up somewhere, it ends up in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3163">00:52:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">someone's pockets, probably the pockets of the shareholders of some contractor, or the donors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3168">00:52:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of individuals or employees. Well, there's also there's also individuals that benefit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3173">00:52:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but functionally, what's going on is it's a system of wealth transfer. And that's not necessarily bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3178">00:52:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">The question is, is the transfer of wealth happening to the right groups that we intend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3183">00:53:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to support with these social programs?

And I think that's probably a set of standards for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3193">00:53:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">accountability that we should probably try and create. But where does that where does that money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3198">00:53:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">end up?

Well, I guess what I'm asking is where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3207">00:53:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">even that leakage of 50% doesn't that just end up in the normal economy?

But that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3217">00:53:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">what I'm saying. It is a wealth transfer. It is a system of wealth where it ends up in people's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3220">00:53:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">pockets.
