If I had a boss who was like, no, you can't travel, you got to come to the office, but entrepreneurship gives me that affordability.</p><p>And with business, the greatest part about it, which people don't recognize is that, yes, it does take some effort to get started. Yes, you have to find something people are excited to give you money for, but you can ultimately spend most of your time, if not all of it, in just the areas you like.</p><p>And guess what? There's people that like doing customer support, like Amy, which I don't know how she does it. Shout out, Amy, I love you. And they're happy there, and they get to live their dream lives, and that is available. It's not such this, like, oh, I've got to spend all night and don't have any free time around it.</p><p>That's what this stuff enables you to have that option available.</p></div></div></body></html>
