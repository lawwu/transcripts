So it didn't matter where I looked. For four days, it was going to be somewhere between $100 and $200. As I always do, I looked on AutoSlash first because it's just a great comparison site.</p><p>And then I went to the individual rental car company websites because sometimes AutoSlash won't search any special kind of discounts you have. And so with Hertz and National, there is a discount associated with having an Amex Platinum card. First, I had a discount from Founder's Card. Surprisingly, those discounts were all much better than the AutoSlash rates.</p><p>And I'd heard some horror stories when I was looking online for renting cars in Mallorca that during the summer it can be crazy and you show up and your car's not there or you have to wait a few hours. And all these reservations were pay at the counter. You didn't have to prepay anything.</p><p>So I booked a car at Hertz, and then I booked a backup car at Sixt half an hour later. They're both around $150 for four days.</p></div></div></body></html>
