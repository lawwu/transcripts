And now, my conversation with Dr. Matthew Johnson. Well, Matthew,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=21" target="_blank">00:00:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been looking forward to this for a long time. I'm a huge fan of your scientific work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm eager to learn from you. Likewise. Big fan and happy to do this with you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=31" target="_blank">00:00:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Well, thank you. My first question is a very basic one, which is what qualifies a substance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=37" target="_blank">00:00:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">as a psychedelic? Nomenclature is a real challenge in this area of psychedelics. So, starting with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">word psychedelic, it just, if you're a pharmacologist, it's not very satisfying because that term really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">spans different pharmacological classes. In other words, if you're really concerned about receptor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">effects and the basic effects of a compound, it spans several classes of compounds. But overall,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">so it's really more of a cultural term or it does have a relationship to drug effects, but it's at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">at a very high level. So, all of the so-called psychedelics across these distinct classes that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.260</a></span> | <span class="t">can talk more about, the way I put it is they all have the ability to profoundly alter one's sense of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.260</a></span> | <span class="t">reality. And that can mean many things. Part of that is profoundly altering the sense of self</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">acutely. So, when someone's on the psychedelic. So, the different classes that can be the specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">pharmacological classes that can be called a psychedelic are one that what are called the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">classic psychedelics. So, in the literature, you'll see that term. And hallucinogen and psychedelic are all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.020</a></span> | <span class="t">have traditionally been used synonymously. I think there was a little of a tendency to stay away from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.940</a></span> | <span class="t">psychedelics of the baggage, but there's been a return to that in the last several years. But the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.900</a></span> | <span class="t">classic psychedelics or classic hallucinogens are things like LSD, psilocybin, which is in so-called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">magic mushrooms. It's in over 200 species that we know of so far of mushrooms. Dimethyltryptamine or DMT,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">which is in dozens and dozens of plants. Mescaline, which is in the peyote cacti and some other cacti like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.940</a></span> | <span class="t">San Pedro. And even amongst these classic psychedelics, there are two structural classes. So, that's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.060</a></span> | <span class="t">chemistry. There's the tryptamine based compounds like psilocybin and DMT. And then there's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.980</a></span> | <span class="t">phenethylamine based compounds. So, these are the basic two basically building blocks that you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.380</a></span> | <span class="t">starting from, either a tryptamine structure or a phenethylamine structure. But that's just the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">chemistry. All of the, what's more important, or at least to someone like me, are the receptor effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And then ultimately, that's going to have a relationship to the behavioral and subjective</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">effects. So, all of these classic psychedelics serve as agonists or partial agonists at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">serotonin-2A receptor. So, subtype of serotonin receptor. Then you have these other classes of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that you, compounds that you could call psychedelic. Another big one would be the NMDA antagonists. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.060</a></span> | <span class="t">this would include ketamine, PCP, and dextromethorphan, something I've done some research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.340</a></span> | <span class="t">with which folks might recognize from like robo-tripping, guzzling like, you know, call syrup.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.900</a></span> | <span class="t">A large overlap in the types of subjective effects that you get from those compounds compared to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">2A agonist classic psychedelics. But then you have another big one of MDMA, which really stands in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.620</a></span> | <span class="t">class by itself. So, it's been called an intactogen. What does that mean? It means like touching within.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.460</a></span> | <span class="t">It sort of eludes to the idea that it can really put someone in touch with their emotions. It's also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.020</a></span> | <span class="t">been called an empathogen, meaning it can afford empathy. So, I get the impression that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the psychedelic space is an enormous cloud of partially overlapping compounds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Meaning, some are impacting the serotonin system more than the dopamine system. Others are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">impacting the dopamine system more than the serotonin system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Given that the definition of a psychedelic is that it profoundly alters sense of self,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">at least that's included as a partial definition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Mm-hmm. I think of psychedelics as profoundly altering models. You know, we're prediction machines,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and so much of that is top-down. And psychedelics have a good way of, loosely speaking, dissolving those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.860</a></span> | <span class="t">models. And one of the reality…</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you give us an example of a model? Like, I know that when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I throw a ball in the air, it falls down, not up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">This might sound extreme, but there are these cases. It was overblown in sort of the propaganda</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">of the late '60s, early '70s, but there are credible cases of people, and it's very atypical, of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">sounds like they really thought they could fly and, you know, jump out of a window. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.060</a></span> | <span class="t">far more people every year fall, I mean, who knows, you know, they fall and die out of, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.140</a></span> | <span class="t">from height because they're drunk, you know.

But, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.340</a></span> | <span class="t">there are some, like, pretty convincing cases. There was one research volunteer in our studies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">that she looked like she was, in one of our studies, like, she was trying to dive through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.780</a></span> | <span class="t">a painting on the wall. She was fine, but she, reviewing the video, it looked like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">she really thought that she was going to go through that painting, and who knows?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.580</a></span> | <span class="t">- So, she was- - In the other dimension.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.900</a></span> | <span class="t">- Yeah. So, they're violating these predictions. The reason I ask it, the question the way I did,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">is because given the enormous cloud of different substances, and given the range of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">previous experiences that people show up to a psychedelic experience with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like the ability to extract some universal themes is useful, especially for people who haven't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">done them before, right? - Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHbhzArbfE&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.540</a></span> | <span class="t">- Who might not have an understanding of what their effects are like.
