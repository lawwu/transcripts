He was born into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTdsUwHofLM&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">considerable wealth.

So there was a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTdsUwHofLM&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">wealth. I think his income, if I remember and if I'm right in this, when he was during the war years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTdsUwHofLM&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and before, was somewhere around $100,000 a month. And that's a lot of money in the 1930s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTdsUwHofLM&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So he just lived in his head for most of his early, early years until he got to Berkeley</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTdsUwHofLM&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and discovered that prime students of his were living on cat food. I mean, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTdsUwHofLM&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">cans of god-awful cat food because they couldn't afford anything else. And once he understood that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTdsUwHofLM&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">there was great suffering in the world, he jumped in on it as he always did when he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTdsUwHofLM&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">became interested in something. So all of those things come together. I do think his brother,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTdsUwHofLM&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">well, there's no question that his brother, Frank, was a member of the party, as was Frank's wife.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTdsUwHofLM&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the whole question of Oppenheimers lying to the security people during the Second World War,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTdsUwHofLM&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">which he did, about who approached him and who was maybe trying to get him to sign on to some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTdsUwHofLM&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">espionage, I think was primarily an effort to cover up his brother's involvement.

I don't think he did.

And Oppenheimer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTdsUwHofLM&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">quite correctly, wanted Frank around.
