href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And GPT-40 was, you know, world-class not that long ago.</span></div><div

want to dig into this model development in particular, you know, a year ago, we were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.440</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about these models being these, you know, stochastic parrots, you know, and we really had to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">compress the entire internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So you go back to GPT-4, you know, and you're compressing, you know, the entire internet, but now we really don't need to do it because we've trained them to use tools like the internet, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.580</a></span> | <span class="t">They're true reasoning engines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">When I ask a question today, you know, it doesn't just spit out an answer immediately, it goes and uses the tool and it searches the internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you don't have to compress all this Wikipedia information, I don't know, take a subject like World War II, you just need to know how to go out and use the internet to find the information, to summarize it in real time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.140</a></span> | <span class="t">How has that changed the pace of progress and the balance between open and closed?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and so it's spot on, right, Brad, what we see now, and you see it when you use these reasoning models, and what I suggest everyone do is when you're using a reasoning model, you can usually expand out its thought process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you ask a question, it'll say, oh, the person is asking a question about this, what should I do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me go and maybe search the internet, let me go do a few different things, it can have a lot of different tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the push has been towards, you know, really, really strong reasoning models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, we have to give credit there, OpenAI really started that with O1, that was really the first reasoning model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that was put out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think on the back of the research and the back of it, you know, everyone talked about, and, you know, the pod's good friend, Noam Brown was the leader on that program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Everyone's been able to look at that and say, let's reframe the problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And this allows us to build stronger reasoning models that don't have to compress, like you said, all the internet's information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And once they're coupled with strong tools, you start getting these really, really incredible results that don't even just show up in benchmarks, because none of the benchmarks really allow you to use a tool to answer the results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right, exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And if they did, we're going to see a whole bunch of new set of results that happen there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=577"

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">there's new ones popping up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, I almost feel like an idiot when Kimmy comes out and moonshot and then this week, I guess, I don't even know how to pronounce it, Zipu, you know, releases a model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I go on PitchBook and I look it up and they've already raised $1.4 billion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So it shouldn't have been a secret, but I didn't know about it, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of a sudden they're in the leader tables on open router and like, oh, my God, you know, they're coming out of everywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And what it shows you is just that when you have a competitive dynamic where every single player,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.940</a></span> | <span class="t">and I think there may be seven or eight dig pocketed players with open models in China, they all learn from each other extremely fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And in this case, unlike software, you can use one model to distill the other and make it better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's almost like an accelerated, you know, form of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And you just get massive, quick co-evolution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And I came up with a little analogy for people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll try and do it quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But imagine you had two communities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">They're both farming communities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And let's say there's 10 to 20 farms in each.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And in one community, they come into the farmer's market once a week, and they just compete by selling their products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But then they go back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">In the other community, when they come into farmer's market, they also, in addition to competing and selling, they're forced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know who would force them, but they're forced to share all their best practices from that week with everybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And everyone does it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And everyone shares their best practices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if you ran that exercise over two years or whatever, obviously, the community where the best practices are shared across all farms is going to have a higher global output for the community than the one where you've just got proprietary ideas driving, you know, the individual and just competition without the ideas sharing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And that may, like, even me saying that may cause some people to scream, that's socialism or, like, you know, they may not understand open source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Or how it works or how it works or why.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But I do think you end up with a higher fitness level for a community that's behaving that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Overall, you may end up with a lot less chance of a breakout monopolist like we've had in many of the sectors in American technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I mean, let's just assume the Chinese government is, in fact, encouraging this in whatever ways, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, if you look at the release of the AI action plan last week, the Trump administration, you know, had a section.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.380</a></span> | <span class="t">They did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is about encouraging open source and open weight models in the US saying that these could become standards in some businesses and academic workloads.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's important they're built on the American AI stack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, as an aside, the Chinese quickly followed, you know, the American AI plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they released theirs a couple of days later where they called for the establishment of a global AI cooperation organization, which I thought, again, is interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, Bill, how do you feel about, you know, like we haven't seen that much traction in the US labs on open source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, Lama has been probably the market leader there, but this is for both of you, you know, handicap for me, if you will, how you think this plays out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">First, Sonny, maybe you start.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you see at Grok?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you see a lot of demand for these Chinese open source models?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And if so, what would it take for an American open source model to catch up?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, one of the things that we should pull up is the chart of intelligence to price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things that you see with the leading open source models now, which are the Chinese, is 90% of the quality in terms of intelligence, but at a 90% price discount.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think whenever you offer that to anybody, you're going to see people want to use that, whether it's individual developers or enterprises.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we're seeing that around the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=918" target="_blank">00:15:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me interrupt there real quick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're looking at this chart, right, in the top right of that chart, you'll see a cluster of these Chinese open source companies, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And the vertical axes here being really intelligence, the horizontal axes from left to right being the cost per million tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you really want to be in the top right of that model, high intelligence, low cost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And what this chart shows is that, to Sonny's point, you can get 90% of the intelligence, right, for 10% or 20% of the cost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And the result, I assume, Sonny, is that you're seeing huge demand at Grok and in Saudi Arabia, where you are right now, for these Chinese open source models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.020</a></span> | <span class="t">We are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then now, just taking that forward, what do people want?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">They want some accountability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what you'll get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.360</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what you sort of got out of Linux and, say, Red Hat, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.900</a></span> | <span class="t">As great as Linux was, and Bill was touching on it, the majority of the enterprise was using a distribution, which they could go and point to someone if they needed something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think the world wants models that they can get from companies that they can go to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And so to answer your question on what happens, I think if we look at Q4 this year or Q1 next year, I'd be willing to say, you know, a top three worldwide model will be a U.S.-based open source model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1005" target="_blank">00:16:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, we've got two big efforts happening there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.980</a></span> | <span class="t">We know we have the open AI, open source, which, you know, a lot of people have been working on, and open AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And even, you know, Sam himself has commented on that, and it's released later this summer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we have all the efforts by Meta.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you take – you combine both of those things together, I don't think you end up with something that ends up further down the list in terms of intelligence and or price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1029" target="_blank">00:17:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing I wanted to highlight about the China situation that I think might inform the U.S. situation, I was having a conversation with this extremely young AI entrepreneur that I know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And he was pouring over the Zipu – I hope I'm pronouncing that right – paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And he asked me some information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I went on PitchBook and sent it to him who had funded it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And he asked me, he says, why is Alibaba funding all these things when they've got their own model?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And because they're in several of the other competitive plays.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And it reminded me of, you know, a lot of the points that I've made about open source is, like, if you're not –</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're not confident you're going to win on offense, you want to play defense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1078" target="_blank">00:17:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, for any large tech company, commoditizing a potential threat is actually quite valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you look at what Facebook did with the Open Compute Initiative inside of their data centers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, it may just be – very well be that Alibaba just wants to make sure there's no ByteDance, you know, that equivalent in the AI space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And that would be pretty rational.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason I think that's an interesting data point when you think about the U.S.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, there are several big tech companies that seem to be not on the bleeding edge of AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1119"

target="_blank">00:18:41.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, they have access to OpenAI right now, but they might lose that or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You've got Amazon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:20:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">if they're able to deliver something at the intelligence of, let's call it Quinn, and they're also able to deliver it to market at, you know, 20% of the cost,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1250" target="_blank">00:20:50.140</a></span> | <span class="t">it would seem to me that actors around the world, certainly actor, it would be, you know, part of the American AI action plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1257" target="_blank">00:20:57.820</a></span> | <span class="t">We had won everybody in the world to use that model.</span></div><div

being the upper right, you know, by the end of the year?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.800</a></span>

target="_blank">00:21:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Like these companies that are using Quinn on Grok, do you think they would prefer to use OpenAI so long as it was equally capable and equally priced performance?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1279" target="_blank">00:21:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So two things that we see is brand and, you know, the U.S. domiciled or, you know, someone that they can kind of point at, that wins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if that shows up, it will win.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1292" target="_blank">00:21:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if you're a company and, you know, at some point you have to, you know, get your teams to sign off on what is it that you're using?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1299" target="_blank">00:21:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">What are the risks associated with it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1301" target="_blank">00:21:41.240</a></span>

target="_blank">00:21:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I sort of feel like with OpenAI's release and, you know, Meta charges back or even if some of these startups emerge that, you know, we can point at, I think we'll see a huge shift back towards those models versus the Chinese ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And we really don't know at this point, unless you guys have some inside knowledge, like when Meta makes their second push with all these hires that they've made, are they going to remain committed to open source or even be more open?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1336" target="_blank">00:22:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't, we really don't know yet at this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1339" target="_blank">00:22:19.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. You certainly seen some of those rumors out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1341" target="_blank">00:22:21.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I've seen rumors that on Twitter that they were debating whether or not they should back away from open source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My hunch is that that's a misread.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1352" target="_blank">00:22:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">My hunch is that they're going to stay very committed to open source, but they may complement it with a proprietary model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1360" target="_blank">00:22:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">That would be my guess, as opposed to scrapping open source altogether.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1364" target="_blank">00:22:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And Brad, can I throw one thing out there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1366" target="_blank">00:22:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I think part of the pitch to get everyone there is that it's open because everyone that they're pulling over are coming from closed places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you're really passionate about the work you're doing and you're passionate about where this is going to go and there's only, there's only one company that can fund that to that scale and do it open is, is those guys.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1384" target="_blank">00:23:04.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think it's part of the pitch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1386" target="_blank">00:23:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Some of the researchers like have a religious belief in it, which was evident in the, in the interview with the Deep Seek founder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Like it's, it's, it's oddly like higher on their Maslow, you know, hierarchy than the money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1401" target="_blank">00:23:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course they're getting the money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course, yeah, this one is both.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">This is, I think a really important point I want to come back to Sonny is that you're seeing massive demand for these Chinese open source models today, precisely because enterprises around the world can utilize them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1425" target="_blank">00:23:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">They have 90% of their capabilities at 20% of the cost, 10 or 20% of the cost, you know, so it turns out if you deliver something really powerful and really cheap, that's more important to these players than American values aligned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1440" target="_blank">00:24:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. But if you gave them something that was super powerful and super cheap and aligned with Western values, right? That you think that would be the winning formula for an American open AI model to top the, the distribution leaderboards around the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1458" target="_blank">00:24:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, yeah, on a place like Open Router, you know, where you can see where this is happening, I see, we would see it rise to the top in a few days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">That's music to David Sachs' ears because, you know, clearly in the strategic plan, they're worried about Chinese open source models dominating globally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1478" target="_blank">00:24:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you just watch the pace of releases, the quality of the releases out of China, the cycle time on the innovation in the open source community out of China, it's faster and better at the moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1492" target="_blank">00:24:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So, and the only real big development, you know, we may see some of these new startups, Bill, we may see a reboot out of Meta, but the one that has, I think, everybody really holding their breath and hoping that we see something really capable and powerful is this open source model that's been promised out of OpenAI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1513" target="_blank">00:25:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, of course, Elon says he's committed to open source as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1520" target="_blank">00:25:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Grok 4 is a great model, is impressive what they put out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1523" target="_blank">00:25:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Any idea, Sonny, about the open source plans out of X?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1527" target="_blank">00:25:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think like Elon has been, you know, pretty said it on Twitter that they'll always open source one generation back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1535" target="_blank">00:25:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so while they were on three, you know, they should have gotten to two and now they're on four.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1539" target="_blank">00:25:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think the thinking is that they will get there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1542" target="_blank">00:25:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, my only guess would be is that, you know, right now if they were to open source two or even three, it's so far behind that, you know, what's the purpose in doing it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1555" target="_blank">00:25:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It may not even be utilized and you'll maybe end up having to deal with just, you know, a bunch of internet or Twitter FUD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1560" target="_blank">00:26:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Just coming back to OpenAI, I will tell you, it's like one of those things that really you rarely see in the enterprise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's almost like the demand for like a, you know, like a Tesla Roadster or something or Model Y before it came out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1575" target="_blank">00:26:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Everybody asked for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, that's the model that everybody wants to use right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1579" target="_blank">00:26:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, we can't wait till it comes live and, you know, when it's on Grok, when it's all over the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1586" target="_blank">00:26:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's going to be a real big one for everyone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=1588" target="_blank">00:26:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And while we have you,

which is because of the amount of venture capital out there, companies are not pricing the cost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2088" target="_blank">00:34:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Like no one, none of the model companies, I don't think anyone, even in the verticals, like no one's pricing the cost because they're pricing to take market share.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2098" target="_blank">00:34:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know,

target="_blank">00:36:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, almost since we started the pod, you know, I've routinely highlighted that the steepness of that price curve on, you know, as it kind of becomes, you know, less cutting edge is something I've never seen before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2189"

target="_blank">00:36:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm sure that a lot of people sit around and say, well, it's okay if I'm losing money here because, you know, six months from now, I'll just use the older model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2202" target="_blank">00:36:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And we also talked in the past about how in the internet age, all the startups began with Oracle and Sun, and eventually they all moved to Linux and MySQL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2214" target="_blank">00:36:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there was a, there was a, we got to win at all costs phase.</span></div><div

about cost and optimization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2223" target="_blank">00:37:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so one day, one day we'll likely, you know, make that, make that move.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2228" target="_blank">00:37:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and, and I, a few of the companies I've talked to that are running inference at scale, they are already starting to think that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2235" target="_blank">00:37:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Like they're looking, they're looking at it, you know, from that, from that lens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2240" target="_blank">00:37:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But, but it was, and, and I think that's why Grock and Cerebris are doing so well, but Sonny, give us, give us an, you know, an example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2248" target="_blank">00:37:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I would imagine that the windsurf of the world and the cursors of the world and all these folks who are building these, you know, these coding agents, they've got massive, you know, demand for their applications, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2261" target="_blank">00:37:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But they're paying through the nose to Anthropic or to these underlying proprietary model providers to be able to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2268" target="_blank">00:37:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So what's the dynamic that you see there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2270" target="_blank">00:37:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you see them running to implement CLEN or some of these cheaper models?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2275" target="_blank">00:37:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2276" target="_blank">00:37:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Without kind of getting into specific, any one of them, but like, you know, multiple folks are building their own models based off open source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2286" target="_blank">00:38:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div

models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2290" target="_blank">00:38:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Correct.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2292" target="_blank">00:38:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, given that they're these very lenient Apache licenses and eliminate the entire cost of Sonnet that sits under it for 70% of use cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2303" target="_blank">00:38:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2304" target="_blank">00:38:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And like Bill said, turn that into a premium offering, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2307" target="_blank">00:38:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And say that's the, you know, the gold and, you know, the silver and the bronze are built off, you know, something that's, like I said, one tenths the price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2315" target="_blank">00:38:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">That seems to me, Bill, you know, if I had to forecast, you know, if I'm open AI, I'm running a consumer business with really high gross margins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2328" target="_blank">00:38:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2329" target="_blank">00:38:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Because consumers are less sensitive to what they're paying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2335" target="_blank">00:38:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Their intensity of use is lower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2338" target="_blank">00:38:58.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas if somebody's writing code, you know, there's the variable intensity is high.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2345" target="_blank">00:39:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, for them, it would make sense to launch an open source model back to where we started the pod and price it really low to, you know, drive share knowing, you know, reminds me a little bit of Amazon back in the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2360" target="_blank">00:39:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Amazon had this monopoly retail business they could use to subsidize AWS, gain share for a decade, and then begin to take price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2369" target="_blank">00:39:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">That would be a rational strategy for open AI to follow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2373" target="_blank">00:39:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So you take the profitable consumer business, you use it to subsidize, you know, the market sharing other applications that you hope to build.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2382" target="_blank">00:39:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It's certainly a reasonable strategy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2385" target="_blank">00:39:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not inside that company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2388" target="_blank">00:39:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You have way more knowledge than I do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2390" target="_blank">00:39:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, I pay the $200 a month and I do every one of my searches on 4.5, and I'm probably negative, I would think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2399" target="_blank">00:39:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I do think there'll be some rationalization where these models kind of self-pick which one they're running based on what you need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2408" target="_blank">00:40:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I probably don't need to be using 4.5.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2410" target="_blank">00:40:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And move to more of a consumption logic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2412" target="_blank">00:40:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2413" target="_blank">00:40:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Move more to more of a consumption logic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2415" target="_blank">00:40:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">They're already doing that in parts of their enterprise business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2420" target="_blank">00:40:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, as they've transitioned to more of this consumption logic, I think it's led to some real unlocks, you know, for the business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2430" target="_blank">00:40:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that makes it harder if you're in the lab game and you don't have a consumer product and you don't own an application that you can drive high gross margins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2442" target="_blank">00:40:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think then gets back to this question, how long can you run your business for share, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTqINzeudJ4&t=2449" target="_blank">00:40:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Hoping that someday, because, you know, they all exist at the beneficence of the capital markets and the capital markets are willing to provide an incredible amount of capital to these businesses today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

guess there's some privacy things now you need to be worried about, but I've been quite open with OpenAI about the book and doing research, you know, along the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span
