So there's, you know, there's all this incredible work on physical health benefits of nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, of course, mind and body are united.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, that's one thing that we talk about in the book, that it's mind, body are united.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we have to deal with the environment, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's interesting that there have been these studies about these incredible physical health benefits</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that people get from interacting with nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the most incredible ones, I don't know if you're familiar with this, Andrew,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">was a study done by Roger Ulrich in the 1980s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And what Roger Ulrich was looking at was a hospital corridor in this hospital in Philadelphia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And he looked at, in these hospital rooms, what view did they have out of the window of these hospital rooms?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And some of the hospital rooms had views of modest nature, like a tree and some shrubs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Others were just looking out to a brick wall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was interesting that patients who were recovering from gallbladder surgery, when they had the view of nature out of their window,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">this modest view of nature, they recovered from gallbladder surgery a day earlier and they used less pain medication compared to the people that had the view of the brick wall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's cool about this study is that it wasn't, you know, Ulrich didn't have the power to randomly put people in different rooms,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but essentially patients were just randomly put into these different hospital rooms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not like healthier people got the views of nature or wealthier people got the views of nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">These patients were just randomly placed into these different hospital rooms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And the ones that have the modest view of nature recovered faster from gallbladder surgery and used less pain medication.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And you've got to be thinking, what's up with that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what's the mechanism there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think it's air quality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think the people with the views of nature somehow exercised more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There's something about the aesthetic of nature that can also be physically healing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, that's pretty wild.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.340</a></span> | <span class="t">We kind of followed up on that in a study that we did in Toronto, which was kind of cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">We had health data from about 30,000 people in Toronto.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we had two incredible data sets to quantify green space in people's neighborhoods that we then could relate to health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So the University of Toronto Forestry Department had a data set where they cataloged every single tree on public land in the city of Toronto.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So we had data for 580,000 trees in the city of Toronto.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">We knew the species of the tree and the diameter of the tree at breast height, basically saying how old the tree was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then my student, Omid Cardan, calculated basically how much tree canopy each individual tree provided.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we had this other data set that was satellite imagery of the whole city of Toronto, where we could quantify all the other trees that were like in people's backyards or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And from those data, we basically related health, the health data to the tree data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And we found, so for one variable is subjective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So how healthy do people think they are?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">How healthy do they feel?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And we found that if you just added one tree on their city block, that was related to a 1% increase in people's health perception.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that sounds pretty modest, but to get that equivalent benefit monetarily, you'd have to give everybody in that neighborhood $10,000 and have them move to a neighborhood that had a median income that was $10,000 wealthier, or it was also related with being seven years younger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, the tree effect was controlling for age, education, and income, so that was pretty interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">We also had data on more objective health measures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Does somebody have a stroke?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Do they have diabetes or heart disease?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And there we found if you increased the amount of trees on the street by one tree per neighborhood, that was related to a 1% reduction in stroke, diabetes, and heart disease.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, sounds pretty modest, but to get that equivalent benefit monetarily, you'd have to give every household in that neighborhood $20,000, have them all move to a neighborhood that's $20,000 wealthier, or it was also related to being one and a half years younger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So pretty incredible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, I can't say causality because it's correlational, but I'm fairly confident in the direction because the worst case scenario is just healthier people choose to live in neighborhoods that have more trees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But they can't be younger, they can't be wealthier, they can't be more educated because we controlled for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, for that study, maybe the mechanism could be air quality, or maybe the mechanism could be, you know, maybe people are more willing to exercise if there's more trees on the street.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But pretty incredible stuff that just increasing the tree canopy a little bit, you could get these physical health benefits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">That is impressive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">For people that don't have the opportunity to plant more trees in their neighborhood, would getting and tending to an indoor plant have any positive effects?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So people have found some effects of having indoor plants, not necessarily to these physical health benefits, but there's some attention benefits of having indoor greenery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">There's also been some benefits, like hospitals now are starting to take this seriously, that patients subjectively feel better when there's this greenery around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I've seen other work too, that people that are having some procedures that are very painful, that actually bringing greenery into the hospital rooms can be helpful for reducing feelings of pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I'm about to embark on putting a bunch of plants in my place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm also a big fan of fish tanks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.420</a></span> | <span class="t">As long as you take good care of them, underwater scapes are really cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And I like to think, I don't have any data on this, but I like to think that they are passive and restorative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Staring at a fish tank is a lot like being in a dream.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, there's a, in Toronto, there's a Ripley's Aquarium and they have this tank that's got kelp and you can see the kelp kind of moving in the water.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It definitely feels very restorative and watching the fish swim around also feels very, very restorative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, the feeling that might be familiar to people that visited, for instance, the Monterey Bay Aquarium or this aquarium that you're describing is when the tanks are at eye level or higher, it puts you into this other world, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.280</a></span> | <span

bottom of the ocean or you're in the ocean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.280</a></span> | <span

always striking to me is when you leave an aquarium and you're out into the real world again, it feels so different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

you walk out of a really great movie, the world feels different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=468"

is so much of what we're talking about today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k13zO9Xj9YA&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.080</a></span> | <span
