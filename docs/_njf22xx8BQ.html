it did it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=150">00:02:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Here are the quotes.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=152">00:02:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It didn't even need the document.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=154">00:02:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But that was until I actually checked out whether the quotes were legitimate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=158">00:02:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And lo and behold, it had made up the quotes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=161">00:02:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I searched far and wide for these quotes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=164">00:02:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And unless I'm going completely crazy, they are completely made up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=167">00:02:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So when it found those quotes earlier, it wasn't drawing upon its own knowledge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=171">00:02:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It was finding them

hallucinations that the model can do if it doesn't have enough data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=180">00:03:00.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to get back to reliability and factuality in a moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=185">00:03:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I got it to write an epilogue to the death of Ivan Ilyich, an incredible short story by Leo

output that to a PDF, which is convenient for many people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=197">00:03:17.820</a></span> | <span

for these findings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=651">00:10:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it also gave a full summary of some of the findings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=654">00:10:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, the higher sales in the East region could be due to a higher population density, better distribution networks, or higher demand for the company's products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=661">00:11:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And at this point, you could either use the web browser plugin to do more research on your own, or you could upload more files.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=668">00:11:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually asked, and I think this is a great question:</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=670">00:11:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Suggest six other company datasets you would find helpful to access to test these suppositions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=676">00:11:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, obviously, a lot is going to come down to privacy and data protection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=679">00:11:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But GPT-4 Code Interpreter can solve this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=681">00:11:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It can suggest further files that would help it with its analytics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=685">00:11:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it gives those below.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=686">00:11:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, the lazy CEO could just upload those files and get GPT-4 Code Interpreter to do further analysis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=693">00:11:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't have to think about what to upload.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=695">00:11:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">GPT-4 will suggest it for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=697">00:11:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Whether that's advisable or not, I'll leave you to decide.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=700">00:11:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The next one is slightly less serious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=702">00:11:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's that Code Interpreter can output PowerPoint slides directly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=706">00:11:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I know when Microsoft 365 Copilot rolls out, this might be a little bit redundant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=711">00:11:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's cool to know you can output directly into PowerPoint the visualizations and analysis from Code Interpreter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=717">00:11:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, on to mathematics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=719">00:11:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And many people pointed out that I didn't fully test out Wolfram to give it a fair shot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=723">00:12:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So I tested both Code Interpreter and Wolfram on differential equations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=727">00:12:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And they both got it right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=729">00:12:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Interestingly, though, they gave you a link for the step-by-step solutions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=733">00:12:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Because this is a paid option on the Wolfram website.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=736">00:12:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But I did find some other differences between them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=739">00:12:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And honestly, it favored Code Interpreter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=741">00:12:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So here is a really challenging mathematics question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=744">00:12:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And Wolfram can't get it right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=746">00:12:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It says that the answer is 40%, even though that's not one of the options.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=750">00:12:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And yes, it used Wolfram, I think, about five times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=753">00:12:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Here was the exact same prompt, except instead of saying "use Wolfram", I said "use Code Interpreter".</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=759">00:12:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was not a one-off example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=761">00:12:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It fairly consistently got it right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=763">00:12:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So Code Interpreter does indeed have some serious oomph behind it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf22xx8BQ&t=767">00:12:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Just quickly again on the silly stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
