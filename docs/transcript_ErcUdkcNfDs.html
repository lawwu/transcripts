Time is your most precious asset. And like in your prior episode, where you were talking about making more time, we talked about a lot today is not making more of it, but making the best use of it using it more intentionally.</p><p>When you use your time more intentionally, you get better outcomes, you're investing that time in something that has a higher ROI. And so everything that we're talking about that doesn't mean you're making more money with your time, but it means you're using it more intentionally, where you're going to experience higher benefits than you would have otherwise.</p><p>And that applies to all of these areas, it might be productive time where you're pushing and working on things, it might be solitude, where you're just creating space, where you're slowing down, where you're going for walks, it might be intentional listening, where you're with people, and you're really thinking about what's the best way to create these feelings of connection and to develop these relationships of love and support, all of those things, create better outcomes on on the same one unit of time.</p></div></div></body></html>
