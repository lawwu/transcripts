So they've got a crisp clean shirt. They've got a nice wash. How old are they? 20. They're too conformist. Again, some jobs conformity is great, but I get a little suspicious at least for what I'm looking for. Interesting. But I wouldn't rule them out for a lot of things.</p><p>It's a plus, right? Is there a point though where you're in some way being conformist by dressing up in a polo shirt? Like if you're in San Francisco, right now, it seems like the conformist thing is not to wear a suit to an interview. If you're like trying to be a software engineer.</p><p>Yeah. There might be situations where it's so weird. So over the top, so conformist that it's actually total non-conformism. Like I don't know anyone who's a conformist like you are. Maybe they're not being a conformist, right? They're just some kind of nut and then you're interested again.</p></div></div></body></html>
