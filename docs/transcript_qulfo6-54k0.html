So if I think about something like AlphaGo and the move 37, the famous move 37, where did that come from? Did that come from all its data that it's seen of human games or something like that?</p><p>No, it didn't. It came from it identifying a move as being quite unlikely, but possible. And then via a process of search, coming to understand that was actually a very, very good move. So to get real creativity, you need to search through spaces of possibilities and find these hidden gems.</p><p>That's what creativity is. I think current language models, they don't really do that kind of a thing. They really are mimicking the data. They are mimicking all the human ingenuity and everything, which they have seen from all this data that's coming from the internet, that's originally derived from humans.</p><p>If you want a system that can go truly beyond that and not just generalize in novel ways, so these models can blend things. They can do Harry Potter in the style of a Kanye West rap or something, even though it's never happened. They can blend things together, but to do something that's truly creative, that is not just a blending of existing things, that requires searching through a space of possibilities and finding these hidden gems that are sort of hidden away in there somewhere, and that requires search.</p><p>So I don't think we'll see systems that truly step beyond their training data until we have powerful search in the process.</p></div></div></body></html>
