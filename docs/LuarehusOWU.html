Now, this is the second video on multi-agent systems in Agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=13" target="_blank">00:00:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">SDK. The first one, we were looking at more of a orchestrate sub-agent pattern and how we achieve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=20" target="_blank">00:00:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that with the Agents as Tools method, but we didn't cover the handoffs and the handoffs are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">well, they're different to the as Tools method. And the best way of thinking about these two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">different methods and understanding them is the as Tools method or the orchestrate sub-agent pattern.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.580</a></span> | <span class="t">When you use that, you always have one of your agents as the orchestrator, as the controller of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the entire workflow. It's that orchestrator that is receiving and sending messages to your user.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's that orchestrator that is deciding which sub-agent to go ahead and use. And those sub-agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">are always going to respond back to that orchestrator. So, the orchestrator is always in control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas, with handoffs, it is slightly different. I mean, you kind of have it in the name. It's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">handoff. So, let's say we still had an orchestrator, although that wouldn't be a very good name in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.340</a></span> | <span class="t">scenario. So, let's just call our main agent the orchestrator. In the handoff setup, if we maintain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.220</a></span> | <span class="t">three sub-agents, the orchestrator would be handing off full control to the sub-agent. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">the sub-agent may be able to go back to the orchestrator if it likes. It depends on how you set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.340</a></span> | <span class="t">things up. But in many cases, it will probably go directly back to the user. So, the sub-agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.340</a></span> | <span class="t">in this scenario can actually respond directly to the user. Now, both of these approaches have their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">pros and cons. The orchestrator pattern, you can use this orchestrator agent to have very fine-grained</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.780</a></span> | <span class="t">control over what is happening within the workflow. You can call various agents, also in parallel if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">need, and prompt each one of those agents to specialize in whatever it is they are doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.820</a></span> | <span class="t">With the handoff, you can still do that. You can still specialize each of these agents to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.820</a></span> | <span class="t">good at specific tasks. But they also need to be capable of answering correctly to a user. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">generally, because of that, they need to have a better understanding of the overall context of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">system. And one of the biggest differences, one of the biggest pros or cons, depending on which way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you're looking at it, the orchestrator system is generally going to use more tokens, and it's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to be slower, because everything is going through our orchestrator. So, when a user asks for some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">information from the web, the orchestrator is going to be receiving those tokens. The orchestrator is then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be generating tokens to say, "Okay, use the web search sub-agent." The web sub-agent is going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">generating tokens to use its internal web search tool, then it's going to be generating tokens to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">return the answer back to the orchestrator. And the orchestrator is going to be generating tokens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to respond to the user. This is a pretty inefficient approach. There are just a lot of tokens being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">created. It's expensive. And that can benefit you where you really need an accurate system that can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">many things. But if it is, like I just explained with the web search sample, you just need to use the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">web search, it's super inefficient. The handoff approach, because you're handing off to that web</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">search agent, the web search agent can generate a response early to the user. So, you are using one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">less generation step with that, which it makes a big difference. So, which of these approaches</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to go for? It's kind of up to you. Handoffs are very useful though. So, to get started,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we are going through this article here, which is multi-agent systems and agents SDK. And in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">article we covered the orchestrator sub-agent pattern to begin with. That's the video from before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And the handoff part of this article actually comes a little bit later. So, click over here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and we get to the handoff part. So, this handoff section is what we're going to be walking through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">in this video. Now, this all comes with code. So, the code we will find over here. So, this Aurelio</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">CoLab's Agents SDK course. This is part of a broader course on the Agents SDK. And we want to go to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">multi-agent notebook. This is what we're going to be running through. You can open it in CoLab. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the way that I recommend running this. You can also run this locally, which is actually what I am doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, I would recommend running CoLab. It's just easier and simpler. So, if you are running in CoLab,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you will want to run this cell here. This will install everything you need to run through the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">code. If you are running it locally, we have setup instructions over in the README, which will explain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">how you get everything set up. We use the UMV package manager. And it's pretty simple. But again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">not as simple as just using CoLab. So, it's up to you. Now, let's get started. The first thing we do want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to do here is set up our OpenAI API key. I will note that there are many features in OpenAI's Agents SDK that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you can use with other LLM providers. But handoffs are not one of those. So, handoffs, from what I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">seen so far, do only work with OpenAI LLMs. So, we will need an OpenAI API key. So, we'll run this. And you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">get this from the OpenAI platform, which is platform.openai.com. Now, we will be going through some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of the orchestrator sub-agent code just to sell our agents in particular because we're using those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">both in the orchestrator sub-agent part of this and also in the handoffs section as well. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll go and initialize those. But the actual agents themselves are basically the same. We're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">going to prompt the orchestrator a little bit differently. But otherwise, they are the same. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">let's go ahead and just initialize all those. I have spoken more about them in the orchestrator</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">sub-agent video. So, if you really do want to cover multi-agent systems in Agents SDK, I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">recommend watching that as well. Whether that's before or after this, that's completely up to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I will explain the bare minimum to understand everything here. So, we are first going to initialize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this web search sub-agent, okay? Just to be clear, this is not the architecture.webbuilding. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">architecture.webbuilding is shown in this later graph here, which is the main agent. It's basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the same book using handoffs, okay? So, we're going to go ahead and initialize those. So, the web search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">sub-agent is using this LinkUp API. LinkUp is a search provider like Perplexity, like EXA. So, if you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">used either of those services, it's a similar sort of thing. But in general, they provide really good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">search results. So, I do really like using these guys. So, we will need to set up our LinkUp API key.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, to do that, you need to click over here. We have this LinkUp reference and we just need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously sign up if you don't already have an account. If you're following the last video,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you will already have one. So, you will sign in and you should find that you'll have some free credits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it will probably last you a while, I think. So, you need to copy your API key and we'll come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">back over to here and I just want to run this, okay? And then to my API. Great. So, we have that. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">once we have that, we'll want to perform a search. I do generally say, you know, you should always use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">async because if you're building AI agents into an application, like AI is using a lot of API calls</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in general. If you're going fully local, then it's different, of course. But a lot of the time, you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">using a lot of API calls. And API calls, if you're writing synchronous code, your Python instance is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">just going to be waiting for a response. So, your code is sending the API request and it's just doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">nothing whilst it waits for it to return. And that's super inefficient because that's a lot of time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">especially when you think about how much code could be executed in the time it takes for an LLM to respond</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to you, which is, you know, it's like two or so seconds. You could be doing a lot in that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, write everything asynchronously and whilst you're waiting for that response from an API,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">your Python code can go and it can be doing other things within that time. So, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">AI especially is one of those fields where writing async code is generally very, very useful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, we use the async search because of that. Great. We get our search results there. We pass</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">those out and you can kind of see here like this, you know, this is telling me, did I search for world</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">news, right? Search for latest world news. And this is everything I'm getting there. Then I create this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">search web tool. This is what my search web agent is going to be using. Okay. You see here, this is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">prompting and everything for that web search agent. And yeah, we have that. So, we can also confirm,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">does that work? I'm going to ask you, how's the weather in Tokyo? It will tell us. So, let's see that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Very nice weather. And that is, yeah, all seems to work. That's great. Now, we move on to the next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">sub-agent, which is like a dummy rag agent. So, we're pretending to have these internal docs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of which you can read those docs here. Basically, we have our AI robotics startup, which is Skynet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about, I think it's like a T1000 or something robots. I can't quite remember. It was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">while ago when I last read it. But it's talking about how Skynet is doing. And you can see here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So, it's basically all this information here, right? And we are essentially creating this dummy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">rag search here. So, this query that the LLM is passing to our dummy search tool doesn't actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">get used. But that's fine because we're not, you know, we're focusing really on that agentic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">architecture here, not necessarily on a specific rag tool, which takes a little bit of setup.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, we have that. Then we have our code execution sub-agent. Code execution sub-agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is just going to execute some code that our LLM generates. Again, yeah, it's the same sort of thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So, we have our code execution tool, code execution agent. Then we provide that agent with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">specific prompting based on what we need it to do. And yeah, we can see everything it's doing here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and what that comes out to. Cool. Then we have the orchestrator. I don't think we necessarily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">need to define everything here, but we'll just run through just in case. I think we might need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">this get current date tool. This is a tool of itself. This is not a sub-agent or anything like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that. We just also define this get current date tool just to see, okay, our architecture here can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">use both agents as tools and just tools. And then when we move on in a moment to the handoffs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll see that we have both agents that can hand off to other agents and our agent that can just use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">a tool or do both, right? So, the agent can use a tool then hand off to another agent, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So, we have that. I'm not going to go and run the orchestrator stuff. That's what we're building here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead, we're going to move on to the handoff parts. We have all of these components basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">ready. We're going to redefine the main agent here, but the website, sub-agent, term.sub-agent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and codecluson.sub-agent, they are all ready. The main difference, as I mentioned near the start of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">video, is that each of these sub-agents, as you can see here, each of these sub-agents can go ahead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and respond to the human user directly. Okay. That's one of the main differences here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So, as I mentioned, one of the biggest positives there is latency, right? Latency and cost as well. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we are removing that additional step to go back to the orchestrator or main agent to get back to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">user, right? Which is not as direct as it could be. So, let's go ahead and implement that handoff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, with the handoffs, OpenAI within the SDK, they have provided this default prompt that you can add to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">your orchestrator or main agent prompt or instructions that essentially just describes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">what handoffs are and that sort of broader system context for the LLM. And I find this quite useful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's your LLM, it has no idea where it is. Okay. And what that means is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">if it doesn't know where it is, it doesn't know the context of, you know, within what system it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">being used, it might do things that we wouldn't necessarily want it to do, right? It might misuse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that system and just understand how to use the system. And of course, we don't want that. We want it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">If we explain to the LLM what the multi-agent architecture around it looks like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">generally speaking, the LLM is going to know, is going to be able to better use its tools, its other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">agents, and understand its own place within that system. And we'll generally get better results from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that. So, this is really useful. They have this recommended prompt prefix here for handoffs, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">handoff prompt, recommended prompt prefix. And we can read it here. Okay. So "handoffs are achieved by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">calling a handoff function, generally named transfer to agent name". Okay. So, internally, what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">happening here is when we have these handoffs here, each one of these is going to be renamed internally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to something like transfer to, and then I believe it would be web search agent or internal docs agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And all those are going to be presented to this main agent as a thing, like essentially almost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">tools that it can call. So, transfers between agents are handled seamlessly in the background. Do not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">mention or draw attention to these transfers in your conversation with the user. I think that bit is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">important because it's very easy for a LLM within the multi-agent system, or even, you know, when it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">using tools to talk directly to the user about what it's doing. And in some cases, you might want to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, if it's like a research agent and you might want the LLM to say, "Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just going to refer to this tool to look up these particular bits of information. And hey, look,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this is what I got from this tool, this information here". So, you might want some level of detail in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">there, but most likely you don't want too much. Like, you don't want your LLM to be saying, "Hey, I'm going to use the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the transfer_to_web_agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and the transfer_to_internal_docsagent".</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't want all of that specific information. Instead, you're probably going to want to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe through streaming or some other interface,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">potentially show the user, "Oh, we're using these various tools or we're using a tool".</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're probably going to want to include sources in particular, which we do do. We've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">prompted all of our sub-agents to provide markdown citations. So, all that does get returned to us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but we don't want it to just return too much information. Okay? So, yeah, we have this, we have our recommended prompt prefix.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You, depending on what you're doing here, you might actually want to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">well, use this as a prefix rather than just the prompt. But in this case, we don't necessarily need to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you are going to use it as a prefix, which I think most probably would be doing, you're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to be adding more text like it kind of has on here. So, yeah, it would be something like this in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">scenario, right? Because it's like an internal company agent that we're building. So, you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">use this as a prefix and then add more use case specific information following that prefix.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, then we have our handoffs. So, handoffs are easy, right? So, we've defined our agents already,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">they're standard agents, and then we pass them as a list into the handoffs parameter of our agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">definition. Then we also want to provide handoff description. So, this is just, okay, in general,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">how should I use these handoffs? You can get more specific in this as well if you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">depends on how your agent is behaving. If you find that it's not using the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">tools correctly in various cases, you might want to say, oh, you need to use this handoff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1094" target="_blank">00:18:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in this particular scenario, right? You can get more specific. It just depends on what you're going for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And based on your testing of the agents, where is it lacking ability and where is it performing well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">right? You would obviously just iterate on your instructions and your handoff description based</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1117" target="_blank">00:18:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">on that. And the final thing is that we do also include a tool. So, this tool is just for the main</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">agent. Okay. Cool. So, we have that. We run it and we go on and just say, okay, how long ago from today</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1132" target="_blank">00:18:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">was it when we got our last red and report? Okay. So, ideally, what is going to happen here is the main</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">agent is going to go and use the get current date tool. It's going to receive that information and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">all of that then it's going to hand off to the, I would say, the internal docs sub-agent. And the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">internal docs sub-agent will see, okay, the previous tool call for the get current time. It will see the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1157" target="_blank">00:19:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">query from the user and it will be able to go and check its own internal docs tool, get the revenue report,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and return all of that information to the user. So, I think the revenue report in the internal docs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that we have, the date on that is April 2nd, 2025. So, let's see what happens there. When we're comparing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1185" target="_blank">00:19:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the time between the orchestrated sub-agent, I was getting like 7.5 seconds for this query</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1190" target="_blank">00:19:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">with the orchestrated sub-agent pattern. So, that's without handoffs. And then with the handoffs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I was getting there 6.4 seconds. There may also be network latency involved there. And we can try</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">running it again, although we might run into some caching or prompt caching there. So, let's just see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">what we get. So, interestingly, I'm getting very long response time to say, which is not normal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1212" target="_blank">00:20:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">This is, I assume it's my network latency or something wrong with OpenAI. Okay. Well, we see it's still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">running. That was an insanely long time. The answer is correct, right? But that time is a bit crazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1227" target="_blank">00:20:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But we can have a look. So, let's just take a look at the tracing dashboard, because we also get tracing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1234" target="_blank">00:20:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">by default with Agents SDK, which is really very useful. So, let's talk a little bit about this in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of the previous videos. But I'm going to go to the dashboard here. I'm going to go to traces and we'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1247" target="_blank">00:20:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">just see, okay, why did that take so long? And it does seem like it was actually on the OpenAI side,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">which is pretty wild. Wow. So, when we look at this, we can see, well, what took such a long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1264" target="_blank">00:21:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, our main agent step here was just 3.8 seconds. Okay. And that was, you know, it was just, it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1272" target="_blank">00:21:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">normal, right? So, we got the get, we decided, okay, I'm going to use the get current date tool. It did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1278" target="_blank">00:21:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It got that and then it decided, okay, I'm going to use the transfer to internal docs agents. And it did that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1286" target="_blank">00:21:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there was a, it created that handoff. And that's what we see here. Then we came to this internal docs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">agent and took an incredibly long time. The internal docs agent decided first to use the search internal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1299" target="_blank">00:21:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">docs tool. And that was very quick. So, we had this, it took 1.5 seconds to generate that. The docs tool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1307" target="_blank">00:21:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not really doing anything. So, it was really fast to respond. Then, this response here took</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1315" target="_blank">00:21:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a incredibly, incredibly long time. And looking at this, there's nothing in here that, in my opinion,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">there's nothing in here that should have taken a very long time. All it did was generate this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1330" target="_blank">00:22:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it read all this information here, the LM, and we're using GPT 4.1 mini, should be very fast. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this is a response we got. Okay. So, there's nothing crazy in here. Like, I could have assumed if this was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1345" target="_blank">00:22:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like a basically an essay, but it's not. It's 55 tokens output and 615 tokens input, which is not that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">there's nothing significant. So, to me, this time here is a bit of an outlier and very likely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1364" target="_blank">00:22:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">from OpenAI. And if I run it again, it's 11.2 seconds. Not as good as what I was seeing before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1369" target="_blank">00:22:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">but at least a lot more reasonable than what we saw. So, yeah, the correct information has been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1377" target="_blank">00:22:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">returned is going through that. So, okay. That seems to be working other than the outliers in latency there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1385" target="_blank">00:23:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Just to confirm, we can take a look at that last run and just check, okay, what actually happened</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1392" target="_blank">00:23:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">there. And we can see exactly the same thing. Just that final post, that final LM generation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">was not like insanely long, which is what we see there. Great. So, we have that. And now we have our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">next question, which is what is our current revenue and what century of revenue comes from T1000 units?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, what we would typically see here, or what we would need to be aware of is in this question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we're kind of asking for two sub-agents to be used. We have what is our current revenue,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">which is the internal docs sub-agent. And then we also have what percentage of revenue comes from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1427" target="_blank">00:23:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the T1000 units, which is ideally the code execution agent, you know, just to be careful in how we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1434" target="_blank">00:23:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">computing things. Although what we'll find is that it will, the internal docs sub-agent will likely just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1440" target="_blank">00:24:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">calculate it itself, because it's not too difficult of a calculation, but particularly for those more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1445" target="_blank">00:24:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">complicated calculations, we'd ideally want to hand off to the code execution sub-agent. And to be honest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1451" target="_blank">00:24:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">even ideally for simple calculations, because LLMs can fairly easy get calculations wrong,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1458" target="_blank">00:24:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">although they have gotten much better at it recently, it's still something that they're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1464" target="_blank">00:24:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">hallucinate every now and again. And we want to try and avoid that as much as possible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1468" target="_blank">00:24:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which is much easier to do when we have another agent writing and executing code. Because if it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1475" target="_blank">00:24:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">writes that code wrong, it's not going to run. It's going to be told, "Hey, you need to write this code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1482" target="_blank">00:24:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">correctly." And it will usually basically fix itself and realize it's the error and resolve the issue. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1489" target="_blank">00:24:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it generally, it can be much safer to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1496" target="_blank">00:24:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's see how long this one takes. So we've got 7.7 seconds. This is more aligned with what I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1504" target="_blank">00:25:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">seeing before, actually. So we have all of this current revenue, and this is the correct percentage from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1513" target="_blank">00:25:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the T1000 units. So yeah, this is accurate. Although if we have a look at the agent workflow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the most recent one here, we will see that, okay, use the internal docs. It seems to use them, I think it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1534" target="_blank">00:25:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">called parallel. Yeah, it tried parallel tool calls here. It was trying to search your current revenue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1540" target="_blank">00:25:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and revenue percentage from the T1000 units because the internal docs agent thinks that it's using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1546" target="_blank">00:25:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like an actual WAG tool that has access to many documents. It doesn't, it just has access to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">one, but it's going to try and use that as if it has access to many documents. And of course, the response</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">from both of those is the same. So we've got that response and it uses that to generate the answer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1562" target="_blank">00:26:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which is what we have here. So yeah, all of that happened as we would expect it to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1570" target="_blank">00:26:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So nothing surprising that. Great. So that's a handoff, so high level. What I do want to cover</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1578" target="_blank">00:26:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is a few other handoff features. And these are not necessarily things that we're going to be using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1583" target="_blank">00:26:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in production, maybe in some cases, not most of the time. Instead, I think most of these features</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1589" target="_blank">00:26:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">are very useful for development and debugging and just understanding what is going on. So we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1595" target="_blank">00:26:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">three things on take you through. We have on handoff, which is a callback that gets executed whenever we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1602" target="_blank">00:26:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">hand off to a sub agent. And in a production scenario, you probably use this to write, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1611" target="_blank">00:26:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">like the fact that a handoff happened, like some handoff event log to a database or to your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1619" target="_blank">00:26:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">telemetry provider, you know, whatever you're doing, that's probably where you would use this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1624" target="_blank">00:27:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">callback. And in development, this can just be a very good place to put like a print statement or a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1633" target="_blank">00:27:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">log, a debug or whatever else, just to see kind of what is okay when a handoff is happening and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1641" target="_blank">00:27:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever information you need within that handoff as well. So that can be really useful for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1646" target="_blank">00:27:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll take you through that you're using that in a moment. We then also have input type. So input type</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1652" target="_blank">00:27:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">allows us to define a specific structured format to be used by our agent in the handoff. So to pass</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1660" target="_blank">00:27:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">particular information to either the sub agent or actually through the callback. So those can obviously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1668" target="_blank">00:27:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">be used in tandem. So you can, you'll get some structured information that you then print or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1675" target="_blank">00:27:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">saw in your telemetry somewhere based on whatever you put into this input type. So that can be really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1680" target="_blank">00:28:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">useful. And then we also have input filter. I expect OpenAI are going to add more to this feature in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1686" target="_blank">00:28:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">future. The way that OpenAI describe input filter is like you can use it to filter various things that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1693" target="_blank">00:28:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">going into your agent that you're handing off to. So the way that they phrase it makes it seem like you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1699" target="_blank">00:28:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">can filter. Like maybe you just want to filter your user message or assistant message or you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1705" target="_blank">00:28:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">filter the tools that the LM downstream might see. But right now, the only thing that you can filter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1714" target="_blank">00:28:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is all tool messages for in the conversation so far. So that, that is what it does. I will see in a moment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1721" target="_blank">00:28:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">an example of that and it will probably make a bit more sense. Now, all of these are set via this handoff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1728" target="_blank">00:28:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">object. Okay. So if we start with that on handoff function, so this is the callback that gets called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1736" target="_blank">00:28:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">whenever a handoff happens. So in here, we can, we're just going to print handoff called to the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1741" target="_blank">00:29:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to the console. And then what we do is we wrap our agent that we're going to be handing off to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1749" target="_blank">00:29:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">inside this handoff object. And we also pair that with the on handoff function that we defined here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1756" target="_blank">00:29:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then these become the handoff agents that we create. We define those and yeah, let's run that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1766" target="_blank">00:29:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we're just going to run this. Okay. So what we should see is when the handoff occurs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1771" target="_blank">00:29:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we should see that we should see handoff called below our cell that we're running. So let's run that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1776" target="_blank">00:29:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So we can see the print has occurred there and then we get this. Okay. So it's the same as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1785" target="_blank">00:29:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">before. Great. So we have that. Let's add a little more to this. So one thing with this information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1793" target="_blank">00:29:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">here is that we don't actually get much information being passed to the callback handler. So what I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1800" target="_blank">00:30:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">going to do is I'm going to add a little more information. What I'm going to do is say, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1805" target="_blank">00:30:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I know the handoff is happening, but why is it happening? And where is it being handed off to?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1811" target="_blank">00:30:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So I'm defining this pedantic base model. I'm saying, I want the sub-agent name. We set as field</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1818" target="_blank">00:30:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and we say, okay, this is the name of sub-agent that is being called. Then the reason, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1823" target="_blank">00:30:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">why is this sub-agent being called? And the main agent is going to have to generate this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1830" target="_blank">00:30:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">for that handoff. Okay. So we're going to be able to see exactly why things are happening according to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1837" target="_blank">00:30:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the, according to the main agent. Okay. And then we're just going to print it out so we can, we can read</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1842" target="_blank">00:30:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that. So we do that. We use on handoff again, which is the same as before, but we've added this handoff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1850" target="_blank">00:30:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">info via the input data there. Then we also add input type. Okay. So you can see how both of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1859" target="_blank">00:30:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">together, it can be really helpful for debugging things. So I'm going to go ahead and initialize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1865" target="_blank">00:31:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that and just run and let's see what happens. Okay. So we see that we are handing off to the internal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1875" target="_blank">00:31:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">docs agent because to determine the date of the most recent revenue report for the user, which is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1880" target="_blank">00:31:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">okay. That's what we would expect. And then we get the correct answer again. Okay. So that is really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1887" target="_blank">00:31:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">really helpful. Now with the handoffs, all of our chat history is being passed to the sub agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1897" target="_blank">00:31:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And in some cases, we might actually not want that to happen. In many cases, we probably do want that to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1903" target="_blank">00:31:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">be the case. Generally speaking, I think LMs are going to perform at their best with maximal context and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1913" target="_blank">00:31:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">information to a certain level. You probably like, for example, frag, I don't think there's any point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1921" target="_blank">00:32:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">in just sending everything to an agent. It's better to filter that down. But when it comes to chat history,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1928" target="_blank">00:32:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they saw and tool calls that have been made. I think it is generally best to keep all that information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1933" target="_blank">00:32:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">there and available to the LMs, but maybe in some cases, you actually might want to filter that stuff out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1938" target="_blank">00:32:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can do that with the handoff filters. And we, at least for now, the only thing that we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1945" target="_blank">00:32:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">filter is all the tool call messages. Okay. So I'm going to add that. So we do that with input filter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1952" target="_blank">00:32:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and we're adding handoff filters, remove all tools. This is going to remove all the tool messages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1958" target="_blank">00:32:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Now the only tool that can be called here is the get current date tool. And we've been using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1966" target="_blank">00:32:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that to answer all the questions accurately. So we're going to actually see now that this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1970" target="_blank">00:32:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">our workflow won't be able to answer this question because we're going to be filtering out that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1978" target="_blank">00:32:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">information. So that tool is going to be called by the main agent, but then the fact that that tool was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1984" target="_blank">00:33:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">called, that is not going to make it to the sub-agents that we hand off to. So let's run this and we'll see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1991" target="_blank">00:33:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">what happens. So we have the hand off to internal documentation to find the day of the most recent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=1997" target="_blank">00:33:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">revenue report. And yeah, so now it's telling me that today is April 27th, 2025, which it is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=2003" target="_blank">00:33:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not, it's, we're in May. So it's a little while, it's a little bit off. So yeah, it's incorrect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=2010" target="_blank">00:33:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And that's because we're using that filter. Now there may be cases where you do want to filter out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=2016" target="_blank">00:33:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">those things. It just depends on your use case and what you're building. So that is actually it. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=2022" target="_blank">00:33:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">all I wanted to cover. We've, I think, really dived into what handoffs are, where we might want to use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=2027" target="_blank">00:33:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">them and also where we might not want to use them and the various tools and features that I have also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=2035" target="_blank">00:33:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">included for handoffs. I think in general, handoffs are a really good concept for building multi-agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=2044" target="_blank">00:34:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">systems. And I think that's obvious from what we've seen here as well. But of course, there are cases</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=2048" target="_blank">00:34:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">where we might want to go with that, like orchestrate a sub-agent pattern or something else, or maybe a mix of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=2053" target="_blank">00:34:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">both. It really depends on what you're building, but it's very good to just be aware of all these different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=2059" target="_blank">00:34:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">approaches that you can take when building these multi-agent systems. But yeah, that's all I wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=2064" target="_blank">00:34:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to cover. So I hope all this has been useful and interesting. Thank you very much for watching,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuarehusOWU&t=2070" target="_blank">00:34:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and I will see you again in the next one.
