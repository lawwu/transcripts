So we are an R&D-led AI company</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=22" target="_blank">00:00:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">advancing the science and development of agents, and we come from some of the world's top AI labs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a founding team out of IBM Research, and then we attracted talent from places like Google Brain,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Alexa, Dell Institute of AI, Meta, Microsoft, et cetera. But even more importantly, we have built</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and deployed some of the most scaled AI deployments on the planet, from the IBM Watson platform to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Alexa to the backend recommendation engines behind Amazon Prime, Amazon Video, Twitter, Eventbrite,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">etc. So we really think of ourselves as a distributed systems meets AI R&D team. And our goal is to work on AI agents and to enable all of you to build agents to transform the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're all here today because we are excited about what's actually coming out in AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the long promise of AI over the last several decades has always been that AI will perform actions for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.740</a></span> | <span class="t">This is what science fiction authors have told us since the 1940s and 50s. And I think the time's finally here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And in particular, what we're very excited about is AI that will operate things like, you know, web browsers and various other enterprise systems and software. And in the process, drive great productivity benefits for everybody, both in consumer and especially in enterprise, which is our focus. So we're interested in enterprise because the most interesting workflows are actually in enterprise and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And this will really stress and push the limits of what AI can do. And so what we're building to enable that future to come to pass with the help of all of you are two very infrastructural platforms, the first of which will be G8 in August. Early access is already live right now. So you can go sign up for it. This is called an orchestrator agent. So first of all, it's an agent. And in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a sense that it acts, it plans, it basically also verifies. So it finishes that agent loop between planning, acting and verifying. It remembers and improves over time. But what does it do? It actually allows you to orchestrate across multiple agents and stitch them together in complex workflows. A simple version of it is you can simply orchestrate across multiple LLMs, generalist and open source LLMs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But more complex versions of it will basically enable you to solve very complex enterprise workflows like claims processing, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Now an orchestrator is only as good as the agents that will orchestrate too. So one of the exciting things that we're doing here is integrating the orchestrator with a project that is currently being developed in the open source called Agent E.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Agent E. Agent E is a project that my colleague Tamer had a session on earlier this afternoon. It's a web agent. It's basically meant to control the web like a human would. And currently it's the best web agent on the planet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's stopping the web way to benchmark. And it's designed to basically be used to build multiple enterprise workflows and work seamlessly with the orchestrator agent. So I'm going to play a short video that will show you a little bit more about both these agents and then I'll wrap the talk up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, we don't have sound so maybe I'll talk over it. So our first product is the orchestrator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Generalist and task specific LLMs and agents all using appropriate guardrails. The developer dashboard helps analyze prompts, optimize cost and latency, create new models with your data, and enhance existing ones. Build with confidence knowing your solution is future proof and can migrate to the latest LLMs on demand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The orchestrator is an intelligent agent that improves with use, connecting to agents like Agent E, our web automation agent in development in our R&D labs. Agent E is an open source agent designed to learn how to autonomously operate the web and automate complex workflows. For example, get us a reservation for 15 people near the office around 6pm. We like Asian, Mediterranean, and Mexican. Send the details to Levi, please.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">At Emergence, our mission is to advance the science of AI agents by tackling core AI problems like planning and self-improvement to enable the full transformation of AI and benefit the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so just in conclusion, in our R&D labs, our area focuses around self-improvement agents. This is our core focus. And in the process, we will advance things like AI planning and reasoning, and also solve things like, you know, how agents should be stitched together in really interesting ways through something called agent-oriented programming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're doing all of this in the context of enterprise workflows like RPA and document processing access, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's my time. Thank you so much. See us at our booth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhQfRSueFZI&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.620</a></span> | <span class="t">See us at our booth.</span></div></div></body></html>
