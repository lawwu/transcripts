When neurons are born, they are just like individual cells,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but over time, they grow their axons and dendrites and establish connections with other cells or other neurons</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and actually learn how to communicate in order to pursue their own interests, basically, like to get nutrients and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And over time, they learn how to communicate with each other and with other cells to get nutrients and basically thrive, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And this collective behavior, if you zoom out and look at a large number of them, it's something we call intelligence, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like emergent behavior of smaller individual units that pursue their own interest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So how does intelligence emerge in the markets, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">People always talk about markets like, well, market things that, market reacted to this and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And in some way, markets are more intelligent than individual participants of the market, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's their mutual interaction of these individual members of the market, basically, who pursue their own interest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and communicate and establish new interactions with others, where some sort of collective intelligence,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">which is bigger than the sum of different parts, emerges, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So, how does intelligence emerge in companies?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, this one is provocative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Through Slack, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Where people interact and pursue their own interest in the company, and all together, the company, well, sometimes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">becomes more intelligent than the individual employees of the company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this leads to my final question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So how does, or how will, the general intelligence emerge in computing systems, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And there is a lot of talk about AGI and, like, you know, ever larger models exhibiting, like, super intelligent behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But in my opinion, the general intelligence will actually emerge through interaction of multiple entities, you can call them agents, basically like multiple models pursuing their own goals, interacting with each other, and all together exhibiting something which we can call general intelligence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And thanks to MCP, we finally have this missing part that allows the agents to communicate with each other, and really, like, create a fabric or agentic mesh where they can talk together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So, hello, everyone. My name is Jan Czern. I'm the founder of Appify, and I'm going to talk about the race of the agentic economy on the shoulders of MCP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically, basically, economy where agents can, you know, find counterparts to interact with and purchase services from other, from businesses or tools or other agents, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, B2A and B2B, sorry, and A2A.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.760</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So, before I start, let me just introduce quickly Appify.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Appify is a marketplace of 5,000 tools called Actors, and historically, we come from the web scraping industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So, most of these actors are data extraction tools that allow you, you know, to get data from social media, from search engines, data for AI, for building rack pipelines, you know, data from web for lead generation, and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But also, there are other tools, like data processing tools, and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So, all together, there's about 5,000 of them, and some of them are built by Appify, some are built by our community of creators who actually make money on it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's like a marketplace of software creators, if you will, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Actors are self-contained pieces of software based on Docker with well-defined input and output, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically, they represent a new way how to ship software and publish it, you know, and integrate to, you know, other systems, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, Google Maps Craper, it's a quite popular actor from our store.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It can extract data from Google Maps, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">More data than the Google Places API provides, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, there is, like, creator of the actor description, you know, different stats and so on, something you would expect from a normal marketplace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And actually, thanks to the way Actors are built, it's actually super easy to integrate Actors from other systems, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, we have SDKs for TypeScript, for Python, for OpenAPI, for CLI, like we can call it from Terminal, and it's only because they are well-defined units of software with input and output, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, we have integrations with workflow automation tools like Manic, Zapier, you know, Clay, and many others, so to make it really easy to call Actors from these systems, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But obviously, now, we also have MCP integration, which makes it possible to call Actors from AI agents or, you know, AI workflows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way it works, actually, is the agent just needs an API key or, you know, a workflow account on Appify, and then through our MCP server, basically, it can interact or call any of those 5,000 Actors on our Marketplace, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And actually, this only became possible thanks to, I would say, the killer feature of MCP, which is the tool discovery, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, not many clients support this yet, but just yesterday, I saw that VS Code added support for it, and actually, just like two days ago, Cloud for Desktop added support for tool discovery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically, how it works is that the client connects to the MCP server and dynamically discovers tools to use and to interact with based on the workflow, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And let's say we have, like, 5,000 tools on our store, and there is simply no way we could publish all these tools through OpenAPI, because, you know, the context would be just too large, and, like, the more tools you have, the, you know, riskier the result is, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So we really want, like, provide the tools only, like, as needed, and that's only possible through tool discovery, which I think is really the main thing that will actually make MCP really a huge differentiator from OpenAPI, for example, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, MCP actually quickly became a standard for agenting interaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">This is Google Trends data showing that MCP is basically dominating the space compared to OpenAPI or A2A from Google, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And actually, I think MCP already became a standard for agenting interaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And it became so popular that currently there are, like, you know, many different, like, registries of MCP servers that even guys from Master, our friends, created, like, registry of MCP server registries, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Just to make the sense of it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And, obviously, Anthropic is also working on their own registry, and I think Google's A2A, they have, like, a DNS-based protocol with, like, well-known .agents.json way to, you know, publish the services through DNS.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, basically, there is, like, you know, so many different servers you can now use from the agents, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, does it mean, like, so many tools now support MCP, so does it mean, like, the agents can discover and access any of them on their own, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, not really, because to use those services, your agents still need to have, like, API tokens to those services, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, even, let's say, if you use Zapier MCP, that provides access to, like, 5,000 apps they have in their marketplace,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you still need to connect those individual apps to your services, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, like, GitHub or Slack or, you know, whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Zapier, on its own, is not able to provide access to the third-party services.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You still need to, as a user, to facilitate it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that actually means that the agents are not able to, like, find counterparts or, like, other agents or other tools to interact with on their own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">They are still depending on the human developer who actually build the system, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Who kind of, like, give those agents access to different tools, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And if those agents are, you know, to replace all the people and all the jobs, right, they need to be able to find services to interact with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">They can't just, like, you know, do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it's, like, a basic thing that, like, anyone of us can do, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, to find service and purchase it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I argue that, like, unless the agents are able to do that, we will not be able to reach, you know, some higher level of intelligence of these agentic systems and behaviors, basically, if the agents cannot purchase services, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, how can we solve this problem, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, first, like, sort of, like, a naive approach would be let the agents subscribe themselves to target services, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, basically, in a way, like, agents could have, like, email, maybe a credit card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">They could, like, fill, you know, the subscription flow, maybe solve the captcha, you know, create an account and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But you see, it's not very practical, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's, you know, well, they might need to also have to phone number and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And quite often, the services actually need to have, like, a real person behind the account, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, basically, this wouldn't really work, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, second solution is central identity and payments provider.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">There are, like, a couple of companies pursuing now that, like, there would be, like, a central authority where you can charge money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the agents can use that, you know, to buy services and provide them with their identity, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, Vertifier, Coinbase is now pushing their X402 standard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Stripe is working on this and MasterCard and Visa, too, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think this is going to happen eventually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But running or launching a new payment system is extremely complicated, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you are facing, like, this chicken and egg problem of marketplaces, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I think PayPal had to pay, like, $100 million per month just to buy the market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And, like, launching credit cards in the '70s was, like, incredible challenge, basically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Because nobody was accepting those cards, so why would people use them and so on, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think this will happen, but it will be a long process, basically, to establish this, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=633" target="_blank">00:10:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let me offer the third approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's, like, through a centralized marketplace of MCP services, like, if I store, basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">where you just need one API token or one authentication, one account, to get access to all the other services.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And, basically, it works the way that the developers who publish these tools, these actors,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">actually, they provide their credit card and their account to the third-party service,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and, basically, publish it, add monetization to it, like, how much does it cost to call the service?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they are, basically, the owner of the service.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And now they publish it on our marketplace, and suddenly it becomes available to the whole ecosystem of tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And this way, actually, we can scale it rapidly and, actually, even without the target services knowing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, basically, this way, the actor can run the code itself or wrap an external API or just publish an external MCP server,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">because the MCP servers, they can be actually nested.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You can have, like, one parent server that provides actions or tools of the, like, nested MCP servers, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's another, like, cool feature of FMCP.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You can really build this sort of ecosystem, you know, if you can facilitate the payments and monetization, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, actor charges the user, and then its developer gets the money and pays for the external service,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and anyone can publish such an actor even without the target service knowing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, time for demo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not live demo because the internet is super flaky here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what you can see here is a cloud for desktop that has access to API MCP server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">There is, like, 18 tools available now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm asking, like, what is the venue of AI Engineer World's Fair in San Francisco?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It's possible to use API Actors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you can see it searches the actors for a tool that can answer this question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It will find a tool or actor called RagWeb Browser.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, it's like a Google search with, you know, fetch data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, basically, it asks the query, like, what is the venue, and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it parses the resulting page.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we can see it found, like, SF Marriott Marquis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">That seems all correct, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, now, let's use an actor for scraping Twitter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this actor is not available in the context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the agent doesn't know how to use it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it searches actors on our store and finds an actor that can scrape Twitter, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it calls add actor, which is, like, a tool that adds a new tool to the context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, Claude is very verbose, describing a lot of things about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And, actually, there is, like, small bug still in Claude Desktop that you need to, like, disable and enable a tool so that the tool list refreshes and then the tools become available.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm sure it's going to be fixed in the next release.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And, now, let's use that actor to get the last tweet of AI Engineer Conference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">All right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it calls the actor on Appify.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It knows the Twitter handle, probably from the website.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And, now, you can see that it found the result, and the last tweet from it this morning was something about workshops.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">That seems about right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, now what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we have seen how we can use existing tools in our store.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But, like, let's say, one of our competitors, a company called BrowserBase.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, Paul, if you're here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">They certainly haven't published, you know, an actor in our store.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But, we did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we created an account on BrowserBase, added our API token there, and published, like, basically, their MCP server on our store without actually them even knowing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And, now, anybody can actually use BrowserBase MCP through Appify's ecosystem, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Even without them having to do anything or knowing about it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, now, let's use BrowserBase to fill in the email subscription form on the AI engineer website.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Fill email, janetappify.com.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And, now, let's see what happens, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And, actually, we'll see that the agent will actually call BrowserBase MCP through, you know, an actor published, you know, by us on our Appify store, and perform the actions on the web, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And, actually, this way, we can easily, like, bring a lot of existing MCP servers to our store, and, you know, expand the ecosystem rapidly without, you know, having to ask for, you know, cooperation of the third parties, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's actually what we're doing now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to scale this marketplace rapidly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And, now, okay, so, now it's evaluating, you know, the screenshots, looking for the field, and so on, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And, eventually, it will manage to fill the form, and basically succeed in the task, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I can maybe skip this to save time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It takes some time to, basically, for the agent to find the form, and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It succeeded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It completed the email subscription, and this way, you basically see that you can plug our ecosystem of actors into any AI agents that actually support tool discovery, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this means, now, anyone can publish tools or, you know, agents on Appify store, and monetize them, and immediately get access, you know, to all the AI clients that already, like, integrated Appify and all the ecosystem of tools, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And, actually, people can make money on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, just last month, we paid more than a quarter million dollars to our creators.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And, actually, this number is growing rapidly, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Overall, the actors generate more than one and a half million dollars per month now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">We have, like, one million monthly visitors to the whole ecosystem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And, now, we're in the process of, like, scaling this ecosystem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you're looking for ways to monetize your tools or agents, you know, just talk to us and publish or publish or publish a store and get access to this ecosystem of developers and this visibility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And, there are some open questions, obviously, that remain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, will this autonomous tool discovery provide real value?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, like, everybody who builds agentic systems knows that, you know, like, making sure that the system works as expected is tricky, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=1022" target="_blank">00:17:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Even if it's fixed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if we add this, like, you know, variables that, like, well, if the agents can discover new tools, will it actually work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, currently, it might be a bit flaky, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we're still fairly early.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But, as the models get better, I think, even with the discovery, suddenly, the agents will be able to provide, you know, valuable and reliable results, basically, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this remains to be seen, but I'm optimistic that, like, as the elements will get better, we'll actually get there, that the tool discovery will actually provide real value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, there's a big question of, like, how can agents trust tools or other tools?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, sorry, or each other, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">We know it, like, you only interact with people you trust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, how can agents do that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And, can autonomous agent interaction enable AGI?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, we'll see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blW-lSd5CYQ&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you very much for your
