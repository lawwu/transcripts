When you use credit card points directly, like when you go into the bank's portal and book travel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">and use your points to pay for travel that way, you're usually getting one cent per point value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes there's some uplift, you get 1.25 or 1.5 or something, something like that. But what never</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">happens in those cases, you never get incredible value. So you never have a situation where a $10,000,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">$20,000 flight is available for a reasonable number of points if you're using points in that way. However,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.220</a></span> | <span class="t">when you transfer to the right airline partners or hotel partners, there's often opportunities to get just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.280</a></span> | <span class="t">incredible value. Like it's not unusual at all to get two cents value. But, you know, I frequently see 4 cents per</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">point value, 5 cents per point value and more, especially for the most expensive things. So you might see, for example, a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">$10,000 flight might cost a million points if you were just going to pay with points through Amex travel, for example. But you might be able to get that same flight by transferring maybe 100,000 points, one tenth of that number to the right airline program and then booking with miles. The opportunities are incredible what you can do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think we both have countless examples, some of which will probably come up in this conversation about that. But I think one of the things that often scares people with the idea of transferring points to airlines is that most of the partners, not all, but most of the partners you might transfer are not the airlines that they're used to. If you live in the US and you fly American a lot or United or Delta, there's only a couple programs that transfer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">transfer to United, one that transfers to Delta and none that transfer to Americans. So it can be a little intimidating. So what I wanted to do today is try to walk people through what some of the best programs are. Because if you look and say, wow, you could transfer from Amex to something like, I'm looking at my list, 19 different airlines. Where do I even start? How do I think about this? And I'll link to an episode we did in the past together, all about the best tools to search this inventory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But I thought it might also be helpful today to just run through what are some of those airlines that you're going to see a lot, maybe some that you won't that you can get the most value out of that have really good kind of sweet spots or program kind of rules and leave people with a better understanding for that whole landscape.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: I think that's a really great way of framing this. I was just having a conversation about a week or two ago with a guy who was asking me about the best way he can use the points he's accumulated and I started talking about Virgin Atlantic Air France, you know, all these different options. He's nodding, nodding. And finally, he said, I have to admit it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: I'm nervous about the idea of using these foreign programs that I don't know anything about. And so I ended up kind of backing off and saying, look, I know you're a Delta guy. Next time you're flying a short flight like Detroit to Washington, DC, check whether Virgin Atlantic. Just get on Virgin Atlantic.com. Do a search for point award flights and see if there's a Delta flight that you can book with Virgin Atlantic points. It should come up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: As only 7,500 points, which can be an incredible deal because sometimes, you know, those flights are $300, $400. I said, so just start with something really small and easy like that. Then once you've, you know, gotten used to that, then you can expand to all these like bigger opportunities that we see all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: So I would encourage anyone listening to as we're talking about all the different opportunities instead of feeling overwhelmed by all these things, just latch on to one or two that you might be interested in taking advantage of near term and just focus on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: If it scares you, the idea of transferring to these random programs, just pick one and, you know, try it out on your next trip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: And you'll find most likely that it's really not as scary once you've actually done it. It'll unlock all kinds of incredible value for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Scary is probably the wrong word. The only thing that I frustrates me is to really take advantage of this. You end up with 20, 30 frequent flyer a mile accounts, and you've got all these logins to keep track of. And if you have partners, maybe you have different accounts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Fortunately, if you have a good password manager, like it's not that hard to keep track of all of these things. I think it used to be a, I remember my parents had a spreadsheet before we really had password managers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Now it's a little more straightforward. But also the thing to keep in mind is that for the most part, you're not going to be earning points when you use points to book your travel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: So if you're worried, gosh, I'm going to fly through Air France's program and I'm going to earn a few Air France points and then I'm going to earn a few Avianca points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Well, for the most part, what you and I do is not accumulate points in all these programs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: It's transfer our Amex, Capital One, Citi, Chase points to the programs, book the flights, and then at the end, end up with usually a zero balance in all these programs until the next time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Yeah. Yeah. Although you do have to be ready to be, you know, end up with like a 500 point balance because a lot of times awards show up as like 70,500 miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: And with many of these programs, you have to transfer a thousand points at a time. So the way I think about it is like, all right, if I have to transfer 71,000 points to Eddie Had to make up an option and I'm going to leave 500 points there, I just think of it as like that award cost me 71,000 miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: And I don't even worry about those 500 extra miles that are sitting there because they'll probably never get used.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: If I happen to have another Eddie had award to book in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Great. You know, they'll be there, but it's just not worth worrying about those little piddly amounts that are stuck in some programs after you do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Totally agree. And the one thing that I'll set as another kind of ground rule for people to be thinking about before we run through these different airlines is we're not usually, and I won't say usually, but like frequently, you might transfer your points to an Etihad or a Virgin Atlantic, but not because you're flying Virgin Atlantic or Etihad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: They have all these partners, and whether they're partners from the three alliances, One World, Sky Team and Star Alliance, or they're just one off relationships they have, you end up in a place where it might be more advantageous to transfer your points to, let's call it Avianca Life Miles, which is a South American carrier to book the United flight you want, which seems counterintuitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: It seems, oh, if I'm going to book United, I should transfer to United, but in many cases we'll probably reference today, there are better deals to be had on airlines booking through an airline that is in a partner, but not the actual airline flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Totally. That happens so much. Recently, like a really interesting one came up where if you want to fly Emirates first class now, you can't do that with Emirates miles unless you have elite status with Emirates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: But you can do it with Qantas miles without having Emirates elite status.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: So you can transfer your points to Qantas and then book Emirates first class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

So Air Canada has an unbelievable number of partners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: First, they're a Star Alliance airline, which means you could use their miles to book any Star Alliance flight when it's available for award booking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: And the Star Alliance is the biggest airline alliance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: So right there with just the Star Alliance, it's really compelling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: But then add on top of that, Air Canada has made individual partnerships with probably dozens of individual airlines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: So when you add up what they have from the Star Alliance and all their separate partnerships, you have probably the single biggest group of flights that are bookable from one mileage program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: So that's one thing. The other thing is it has some really great features for award booking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: So, for example, you can book multiple different airlines on a single award flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: It will price the same as if it was, you know, just one airline all the way through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Not every program can do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: You can add a stopover for only 5000 extra miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: So, for example, if you're flying to, let's say, Australia or something, and maybe you're going via the Middle East or via Asia, you can stop in one of those places, add 5000 miles to your trip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Stop and enjoy that location before going on. And it has decent award pricing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: So it's not the best award pricing, but it's decent and I'm good with that. I'm good with paying a little bit more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Let me just give you just a made up example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Like with Air Canada, maybe it would cost you 70,000 miles to fly to Europe from wherever you are in business class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: With another program, there are other programs which can do it for less, let's say, 55,000 miles or 60,000 miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Well, that's great. I would always rather use that other program that has fewer miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: But if the awards aren't available because they don't have as many partnerships as Air Canada, I'd rather take the one that is available than the one that's hypothetical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: If you get my meaning there. Yeah. So Air Canada is like just a really good combination of miles that can be used more often, more successfully than others and a good enough award chart to make it a really good first stop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Yeah, I've used Air Canada a lot. I think the only thing that I'll add is sometimes if you're not certain about an award, you can pay extra miles to make it refundable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1081" target="_blank">00:18:01.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: You know, one of the challenges with non US rewards program, so American, United, Delta, Alaska, pretty much for the most part, you can book an award and cancel it and get everything back with no penalty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1094" target="_blank">00:18:14.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Alaska, you don't get back that 1250 partner fee if it's not on an Alaska flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Air Canada, there is a fee, and it's reasonable, like it's not hundreds of dollars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: But sometimes they say, hey, if you want to pay a few extra miles, maybe 5, 10, 15,000 miles, you can make it fully refundable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: And I've found scenarios where the fully refundable Air Canada price is still cheaper than the United price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1119" target="_blank">00:18:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: So paying the extra to make it fully refundable still saves money over using a program that's already refundable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1124" target="_blank">00:18:44.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Right, right. Plus, you can't transfer to United from very many programs, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: You've got Chase and Bilt are the only ones where you get transfer points to United, Air Canada.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1135" target="_blank">00:18:55.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: So you're more likely to have access to Air Canada miles than United miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Therefore, even if the prices are the same to book a refundable ticket, you might prefer to go to Air Canada because it's easier to get those miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Yeah. One other thing, I know you published a ton of data on transfer bonuses on your website.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1151" target="_blank">00:19:11.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: I looked at all that data and I tried to calculate how often there are bonuses. So something to keep in mind is you can usually, and I say usually because there are some exceptions, but transfer one to one, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Like one Amex point will equal one Air Canada Aeroplan point. But sometimes throughout the year, there are these bonuses and it'll be like, oh, well, right now for the rest of the month, it's 20% more. So one will go to 1.2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Air Canada, historically, over the last few years, has had one to four transfer bonuses per year. So not a ton, not something I'd say, oh, wow, it happens so often, you might want to wait for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: But anytime there's a transfer bonus, if you're in the middle of planning a trip, factor that in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Because if you get 30% more miles transferring to one program, right, we might say, you know, Air Canada is one of the better programs because they have good pricing versus another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1201" target="_blank">00:20:01.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: If that other airline is going to give you 30% more miles, the fact that it's a little more expensive might completely be negated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: So that's how I think about transfer bonuses. I'm not usually speculating and going, oh, it's 20% more. Let's just throw some extra miles in right now, unless I know I'm going to need them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: But certainly, if I'm in the middle of booking a trip, and there is one, I'm trying to see if I can take advantage of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Yeah, absolutely. The transfer bonuses can change the math on which is the best program to book from, because it does become a lot cheaper in terms of the number of transferable points you'll use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1234" target="_blank">00:20:34.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: You mentioned Virgin Atlantic. And that's one where I'd love to hear more because I've just never used it. Like most of these airlines I've dabbled with, I've transferred some points, I booked a flight. I've never moved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Any points to Virgin Atlantic. They're a partner of everyone. Where do you find a lot of value from them?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1248" target="_blank">00:20:48.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: First, let me clarify when Chris says they're a partner of everyone. He means all the transferable points currencies, not that they are partners with all the different airlines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1258" target="_blank">00:20:58.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: They're part of Sky Team, which is a much smaller alliance than the Star Alliance, which is what we talked about with Air Canada. So there's far fewer options for who you can book with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: They do have some individual partnerships, like they partner with ANA, which is a Japanese airline, and you can get some great award prices booking ANA with Virgin Atlantic miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1281" target="_blank">00:21:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: That's tricky because that can't be done online. You have to figure out that the award space is available using some other program and then call Virgin Atlantic to book these. So that's not, if someone's just starting, I wouldn't be looking towards that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1296" target="_blank">00:21:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: But there's a few sweet spots that are worth looking into. One is Flying Virgin Atlantic itself. They've moved recently to a semi-dynamic pricing model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: You can't really predict how many points a particular award will cost for flying Virgin Atlantic itself, other than by doing the search and seeing what it costs for a particular flight. But what we've been seeing is flights as low as 29,000 miles from the Northeast US to London in business class, which is just extraordinary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1337" target="_blank">00:22:17.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: And often with moderate fuel surcharges like in the $300 range. The reason I'm stressing that is that before they made this change to this dynamic pricing model, they had good prices to fly Virgin Atlantic, good prices in terms of number of points, but they tacked on close to $1,000 in fees each way. And so it became not as attractive as it would have been otherwise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1365" target="_blank">00:22:45.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: So now the amount of fees that are tacked on also vary. And so you have to get lucky that one of these really cheap flights is available</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: with low surcharges at the time you want to fly. And, you know, don't get hung up on trying to find that 29,000 point one, because those are really hard to find. But more often, you will see like 40,000, 41,000 points for business class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1387" target="_blank">00:23:07.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Steve McLaughlin: Now you're not going to see a lot of that from the West Coast, I don't think. But for those, especially in New York, Virgin Atlantic just has tons and tons of flights between JFK and London. So a lot more award availability is there. In addition to business class deals using Virgin Atlantic miles to fly Virgin Atlantic, they have some incredible prices for economy and premium economy. So we've seen, you know, economy as low as about 6,000 miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1389"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Wow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Premium economy starts at, I want to say, 9,000 or 10,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1426" target="_blank">00:23:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not sure exactly off the top of my head, but it's just like dirt cheap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1431" target="_blank">00:23:51.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this is especially, again, New York, between New York and London.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1435" target="_blank">00:23:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You can find good prices elsewhere in the U.S., but that's where those lowest, lowest prices, at least in my experience, where I've seen those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1443" target="_blank">00:24:03.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so Virgin Atlantic, by the way, I should mention, people might not realize this, is they don't have a very complicated route network.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1453" target="_blank">00:24:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">They basically fly from London and a couple other airports in the U.K., but mostly London, to some international destinations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1463" target="_blank">00:24:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But they don't have, like, any short-haul flights around Europe, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1470" target="_blank">00:24:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So Virgin Atlantic is best for if you're flying to or from London or if you're going really far past London, like flying U.S. through London to South Africa, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1485" target="_blank">00:24:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You might be able to get good deals for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to fly to Europe, sometimes you can get lucky because they do partner with Air France and KLM, well, and other Sky Team partners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1493" target="_blank">00:24:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But those in particular, if you're flying to one of their airports, then you might be able to find a award flight that goes through London to Paris or Amsterdam.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1505" target="_blank">00:25:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so ANA, but you've got to find it somewhere else, flying Virgin Atlantic Metal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And you mentioned that example earlier for Delta.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1511" target="_blank">00:25:11.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So if someone's looking for Delta flights, is Virgin a good place to look?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're flying domestically in the U.S. on Delta, and it's a fairly short-distance, non-stop flight, then Virgin actually has some really good pricing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Where things start to go awry is if you have any stops along the way, Virgin will price each leg of your journey separately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1538" target="_blank">00:25:38.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So it all adds up and quickly becomes a bad deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1541" target="_blank">00:25:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I said domestic, but actually you can find good deals between like Southern Florida and the Caribbean, for example, because, you know, those are short-distance or even Atlanta and the Caribbean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1551" target="_blank">00:25:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are good deals to be had on just about any short-distance flights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1556" target="_blank">00:25:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Virgin used to be the best way to book Delta business class to Europe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1560" target="_blank">00:26:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But what's happened is they recently started tacking on about $1,000 in surcharges when you do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1567" target="_blank">00:26:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that really kills the deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's where Air France Flying Blue comes in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1573" target="_blank">00:26:13.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll talk about that soon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1575" target="_blank">00:26:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1575" target="_blank">00:26:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's do that because Air France is probably the airline I have booked the most international business class with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Because prior to, I guess, a month ago, you know, things change all the time, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1588" target="_blank">00:26:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It seemed like last year and in years before, finding Air France business class inventory was easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1593" target="_blank">00:26:33.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Then it was really hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1595" target="_blank">00:26:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And now as we're recording, it seems like it's gotten a lot easier again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1598" target="_blank">00:26:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But why do you love Flying Blue, the program for both Air France and KLM?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1603" target="_blank">00:26:43.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me get into that in a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1605" target="_blank">00:26:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But I realized one sweet spot of using Virgin Atlantic miles I forgot to mention is to book Air France or KLM flights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1613" target="_blank">00:26:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So those flights, business class or economy or whatever, Virgin Atlantic does not tack on huge surcharges the way they do with Delta.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1622" target="_blank">00:27:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can get good deals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1624" target="_blank">00:27:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I just recently flew to Europe in business class on Air France for I think it was 48,500 miles each way and a couple hundred dollars in taxes and fees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1636" target="_blank">00:27:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">When you look, did you happen to see what that would have cost if you booked it with Air France or KLM?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1641" target="_blank">00:27:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I'm sure I did at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1643" target="_blank">00:27:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't remember, but it was a lot more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So now let's talk about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1648" target="_blank">00:27:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So Virgin Atlantic has a fixed award chart for booking their partners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1652" target="_blank">00:27:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You can look up their award chart and see how much it will cost to fly different routes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1657" target="_blank">00:27:37.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what it'll be in terms of the miles you use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1661" target="_blank">00:27:41.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Air France, KLM, though, when you're using their miles, they don't have an award chart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1667" target="_blank">00:27:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So what they have instead is if you're booking business class between North America and Europe, those awards start at 60,000 miles, which is good if you could find it, especially flights from the West Coast U.S. to Europe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1683" target="_blank">00:28:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">If you get that for 60,000 miles, that's a great deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1687" target="_blank">00:28:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm saying that because, like, you know, I mentioned before around 48,000 Virgin Atlantic miles to fly Air France business class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1694" target="_blank">00:28:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">That was from U.S. East Coast to Europe West Coast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1697" target="_blank">00:28:17.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a short, much shorter flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1699" target="_blank">00:28:19.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Virgin Atlantic charges more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1701" target="_blank">00:28:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">The reward chart shows it charges more from the West Coast U.S. to Europe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1705" target="_blank">00:28:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Air France KLM would be a better deal in that case if you got the 60,000 point award.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1709" target="_blank">00:28:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">In the case I was talking about, no, I know the 60,000 point award was not available.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1714" target="_blank">00:28:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't remember what they were charging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1716" target="_blank">00:28:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It might have been 90,000, might have been 120,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1718" target="_blank">00:28:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It's it feels very random when you're looking these things up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1722" target="_blank">00:28:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1723" target="_blank">00:28:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the things I liked about Air France is that some airlines are not as easy to find multiple seats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1729" target="_blank">00:28:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, oh, I can find one or two business class seats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1732" target="_blank">00:28:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But Air France seems to, at least in the past, be easier to find four or five seats, which for us, traveling with a family is easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1741" target="_blank">00:29:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And they offer a discount for kids, I think, under 12, maybe you get like 20 or 25% off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1746" target="_blank">00:29:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1747" target="_blank">00:29:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's part of the reason I liked it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1750" target="_blank">00:29:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">What about you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1750" target="_blank">00:29:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1751" target="_blank">00:29:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I'm usually flying, just my wife and I.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1754" target="_blank">00:29:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I'm not as focused on the number of people or the discount for the children.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1758" target="_blank">00:29:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's certainly a great feature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1761" target="_blank">00:29:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">For me, it comes down to a few things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1763" target="_blank">00:29:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">One is I'm at a Delta hub in Detroit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1767" target="_blank">00:29:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's where I fly out most of the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1768" target="_blank">00:29:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, if in the rare situations when Delta releases international business class award space to their partners, Air France, KLM Flying Blue is the way to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1781" target="_blank">00:29:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I just booked one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1782" target="_blank">00:29:42.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, I think it was just yesterday.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1784" target="_blank">00:29:44.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I booked a return flight from Amsterdam to Detroit nonstop business class for two for, I can't remember the exact number of Air France miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1794" target="_blank">00:29:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It was 70 something thousand, I think, Air France miles and a couple hundred dollars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1799" target="_blank">00:29:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I chose that instead of around 48,000 Virgin Atlantic miles and 1,000 euros.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1807" target="_blank">00:30:07.780</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, so that's, I don't know, 1,100, $1,200 or whatever is what Virgin Atlantic wanted to tack on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1812" target="_blank">00:30:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, by paying a few more miles with Flying Blue, I was able to get a much better deal overall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1820" target="_blank">00:30:20.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm sure both of which were extremely better than using Delta miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1824" target="_blank">00:30:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, yeah, I don't even look at Delta miles anymore because the cost is almost tied to the price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1829" target="_blank">00:30:29.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, if the price was, you know, $3,000 for that flight, I don't actually know off the top of my head what it was, but they probably would want 300,000 or in that neighborhood Delta miles for that flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1843" target="_blank">00:30:43.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I have not found a great use of Delta miles other than kind of short haul domestic flights where I'm just trying to offset the cost of the flights versus, you know, sometimes I've seen flights be 60,000 points that were otherwise 450,000 Delta miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1858" target="_blank">00:30:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's just Delta miles are hard to burn in a really, really outsized value way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1865" target="_blank">00:31:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">They are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1866" target="_blank">00:31:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I think of them more these days as like, these are pennies that are sometimes worth a little bit more than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1872" target="_blank">00:31:12.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, if I could get 1.3 cents per point value from my Delta sky miles, I'm happy because I'm not looking for that outsized value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1882" target="_blank">00:31:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's also why I don't look to use my Delta miles for international business or first class because I know it's going to be outrageously expensive in miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1892" target="_blank">00:31:32.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I more look at what the Delta mile cost is when I'm thinking of paying cash for a flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1898" target="_blank">00:31:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's usually for economy flights domestically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=1901" target="_blank">00:31:41.980</a></span> | <span class="t">This episode is

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2065" target="_blank">00:34:25.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So Air France and KLM share this rewards program called Flying

used to fly Delta.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2074" target="_blank">00:34:34.460</a></span> | <span class="t">When flying Delta domestically right now, Virgin Atlantic is a better deal for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2082" target="_blank">00:34:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But we saw that next year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2085" target="_blank">00:34:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So starting in 2026, it looks like Air France, KLM is lowering their award prices for Deltas like short-haul flights and things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2095" target="_blank">00:34:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So flying Blue might become the better way next year for booking Delta.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2099" target="_blank">00:34:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Beyond booking Delta, you know, it's definitely worth mentioning that flying Air France or KLM can be a great deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2107" target="_blank">00:35:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">We talked about that briefly, about how business class awards to Europe start at 60,000 miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2114" target="_blank">00:35:14.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's not just limited to nonstop flights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2118" target="_blank">00:35:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That can be flying L.A. to Paris to Naples or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2123" target="_blank">00:35:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you can find that, that's a fantastic deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2128" target="_blank">00:35:28.020</a></span> | <span class="t">They also have other partners that could potentially play into that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2132" target="_blank">00:35:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So potentially you might fly the long haul on KLM or Air France, but then connect on to ITA or one of the other Sky Team partners in Europe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2144" target="_blank">00:35:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes they have these promo rewards where they're like, hey, I don't know if it's monthly or quarterly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2149" target="_blank">00:35:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't keep track of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2150" target="_blank">00:35:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But they're like, hey, here are some discounts and there are better deals than our normal pricing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2155" target="_blank">00:35:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if you've ever booked one, but I see them all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2157" target="_blank">00:35:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, no, absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2159" target="_blank">00:35:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think I've booked them, but they have those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2162" target="_blank">00:36:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they're monthly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2162" target="_blank">00:36:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">They're usually great for flying economy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2166" target="_blank">00:36:06.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's where we do see they have like a selection of cities that if you're flying from or to one of these cities, you get in on these good deals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2176" target="_blank">00:36:16.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And they'll often advertise them wrong in our favor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2181" target="_blank">00:36:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I mean by that is like they might advertise if you're flying from Austin, you'll see economy flights starting at 14,000 miles one way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2192" target="_blank">00:36:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But then you go to look and you might see economy flights starting at 9,000 miles one way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2197" target="_blank">00:36:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they kind of sell themselves short by I guess they're, you know, over delivering on the deal in those cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2206" target="_blank">00:36:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes they do have business class deals sometimes, but it's usually just one North American city and seems to be as likely to be in Canada as in the U.S.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2218" target="_blank">00:36:58.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, I feel like I frequently see them out of Montreal or wherever that, which is great for people who could easily get to Montreal, but not so great for everyone hoping to find a deal from L.A. or New York or Chicago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2230" target="_blank">00:37:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">The only other thing I'll say is, you know, this inventory that these airlines offer changes all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2237" target="_blank">00:37:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And everyone was kind of in a sour mood about Air France, KLM flying mood this year because there was just not the availability we'd seen historically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2245" target="_blank">00:37:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then in the last week or two, it seems like if you want to go to Europe, now it's a lot easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2249" target="_blank">00:37:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, things are going to change and ebb and flow with the release of inventory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2254" target="_blank">00:37:34.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm hopeful that this is back to the old flying blue where there's a lot more availability and it's a lot easier to book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2262" target="_blank">00:37:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And so right now, at least recording at the end of June, you know, it's gotten better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2267" target="_blank">00:37:47.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And so hopefully that trend continues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2269" target="_blank">00:37:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm hoping it's better than before, even because those business class flights to Europe used to start at 50,000 miles and some number of months back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2279" target="_blank">00:37:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">They change it to starting at 60,000 miles and they told us, well, we're doing that so that we can afford to basically release more word space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2289" target="_blank">00:38:09.820</a></span> | <span class="t">They didn't say it in those words, but that's at least how we interpreted what they said.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2293" target="_blank">00:38:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reverse happened, like after they made that change, all the word space dried up and we're like, hey, what's going on here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2300" target="_blank">00:38:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm hopeful that that was a technical issue or an accounting issue that they've worked through and that now they actually have delivered on this promise to open more word space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2310" target="_blank">00:38:30.500</a></span> | <span class="t">That would be excellent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2311" target="_blank">00:38:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The pessimist in me says, I keep getting these emails from Air France saying they're celebrating some kind of anniversary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2318" target="_blank">00:38:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they're they're having like special deals that like, you know, a sale on their miles and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2324" target="_blank">00:38:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm hoping that this award space is not part of that anniversary celebration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2328" target="_blank">00:38:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I hope so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2329" target="_blank">00:38:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, I should mention, you know, Air France and Virgin Atlantic often have transfer bonuses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2336" target="_blank">00:38:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I averaged it out at five to seven a year every month or two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2339" target="_blank">00:38:59.940</a></span> | <span class="t">You'll probably see one or probably every two months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2341" target="_blank">00:39:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So often, but not something you can necessarily count on that regularly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2346" target="_blank">00:39:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But definitely I would be surprised if three months don't go by and you don't see at least one from some currency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2352" target="_blank">00:39:12.420</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to do that kind of math yourself, our website, frequentmiler.com, we have a post called current transfer bonuses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2360" target="_blank">00:39:20.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And Chris, you mentioned that earlier, but I just want to point out that despite the name of the post current transfer bonuses, we have a second table in that post.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2370" target="_blank">00:39:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">That's all past transfer bonuses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2374" target="_blank">00:39:34.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you're curious about what has happened before, like maybe you're waiting and hoping that a transfer bonus will appear to a particular program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2384" target="_blank">00:39:44.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you want to look back at were there any transfer bonuses in the summer or in the fall to this program I'm interested in?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2392" target="_blank">00:39:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can use that data on that page to look back in time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2396" target="_blank">00:39:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Chris even helped us recently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2398" target="_blank">00:39:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We were missing a couple historical ones and he found those for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2402" target="_blank">00:40:02.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so now we've fixed that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2403" target="_blank">00:40:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So it should be pretty darn complete for the last, I don't know, five years or so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2408" target="_blank">00:40:08.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2409" target="_blank">00:40:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's run through quickly a few of the other programs that are pretty commonly seen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2414" target="_blank">00:40:14.060</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll say Avios because depending on the partner or the currency you have in points, you might be able to transfer to one or multiple of the Avios programs, which is Finnair, Aer Lingus, Iberia, British Airways, Qatar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2429" target="_blank">00:40:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can move between them all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2432" target="_blank">00:40:32.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So while all the different programs have some different nuance, if you have access to just one of them as a transfer partner, you effectively get access to all of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2442" target="_blank">00:40:42.100</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you think about the Avios program as a place to book flights from?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2446" target="_blank">00:40:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's awesome that we have that option.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2449" target="_blank">00:40:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's really cool that all these different programs let you move the points around because even though they often have similar pricing between like booking through British Airways or Qatar or whatever, and they don't always have the same availability for booking flights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2465" target="_blank">00:41:05.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a terrific option.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2467" target="_blank">00:41:07.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not as user-friendly as some of the programs in that there's no easy way to check which of these programs have the best deal on this particular flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2479" target="_blank">00:41:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to like go into each of these separately and run your award search and see how much it'll cost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2486" target="_blank">00:41:26.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of them don't display the answer if you don't already have miles in that account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2491" target="_blank">00:41:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, so it's challenging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2493" target="_blank">00:41:33.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I wouldn't say there's like amazing deals in there, but there are some good deals to be found.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2499" target="_blank">00:41:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are things that you might not normally think about that is really good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2504" target="_blank">00:41:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, if you're interested in flying Qatar Q-suites, which is one of the best business class flights you can do, international business class,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2513" target="_blank">00:41:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You can use British Airways Avios to book Qatar from the US to Doha for 70,000 Avios, which is good, or you could use Qatar's own Avios to do the same thing for the same price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2528" target="_blank">00:42:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But here's where there's a difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2530" target="_blank">00:42:10.100</a></span> | <span class="t">If there is not that saver level award availability with Qatar's own miles, you'd be able to book for 140,000 Avios that same flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2541" target="_blank">00:42:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you have enough Avios and you're really set on, you know, a particular date to fly, that gives you the ability to book even, you know, yes, it costs twice as much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2553" target="_blank">00:42:33.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But especially when there's a transfer bonus involved, that might not actually be that expensive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2559" target="_blank">00:42:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And it gives you the perfect flight on the date you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2563" target="_blank">00:42:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's really good from that point of view.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2566" target="_blank">00:42:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think one of the things that is often the case is booking with the airline for their own flights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2573" target="_blank">00:42:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You get access for some programs to a lot more inventory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2577" target="_blank">00:42:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I know on United, you can book any flight you want with miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2580" target="_blank">00:43:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just not always the best deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2582" target="_blank">00:43:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But even when it's not the best deal, it might still be a better deal than, you know, booking in a travel portal, getting one cent per point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2591" target="_blank">00:43:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've seen this with United a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2593" target="_blank">00:43:13.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, you can go to Europe for, you know, under 100,000 points in business class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2598" target="_blank">00:43:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But sometimes it might be 130, 140, which sometimes I feel, gosh, I know it could be better, like there are better prices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2606" target="_blank">00:43:26.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But if the flight otherwise is still going to be $5,000, you know, it's still going to be half a million points in the portal to book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2614" target="_blank">00:43:34.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So having access to that extra inventory, which usually only comes from the program that operates the airline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2623" target="_blank">00:43:43.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this case, Qatar, it's not true for every airline, but it's definitely a reason that these transfer partners can be really valuable is because some of them have access to more availability on their own flights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2634" target="_blank">00:43:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah, that's a great point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2636" target="_blank">00:43:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So I was just pointing out one very specific example of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2639" target="_blank">00:43:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, but to expand on your United example, I think United, American and Alaska all share that characteristic that sometimes you can book their own flights when you couldn't book them with partners if you have their own miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2656" target="_blank">00:44:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But what they also share is is the free cancellations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2660" target="_blank">00:44:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what I like to do is if I see, you know, I need to fly to Europe, I need to fly to Australia, wherever it is on a particular date or in a narrow window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2669" target="_blank">00:44:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And I see a not horrible use of United miles, Alaska miles, American Airlines miles, if I have enough of any of those miles, what I'll do is I'll book it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2679" target="_blank">00:44:39.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But then I'll also set up a word alerts with some different tools to be alerted when a better deal comes up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2687" target="_blank">00:44:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And when that better deal comes up, OK, I'll cancel my United booking and get back the miles, get back the fees that I paid and book this new one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2698" target="_blank">00:44:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And if if if one never shows up, then great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2702" target="_blank">00:45:02.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I still have a good award flight that I can take.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2705" target="_blank">00:45:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I have never yet taken that good award flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2708" target="_blank">00:45:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The alerts have always come through for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2710" target="_blank">00:45:10.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, I think when we talk about examples with these airlines, you might not find them today, but that doesn't mean you won't find them before your flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2717" target="_blank">00:45:17.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So when it comes to obvious, my historical use of them, which hasn't been very recent, is that, you know, booking short haul, medium flights, especially on American can be a great deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2731" target="_blank">00:45:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Internationally, the fuel surcharges were so high that I've never really seen great obvious uses kind of going to Europe on British airways or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2741" target="_blank">00:45:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Are there any other kind of obvious sweet spots you found that or places to avoid?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2747" target="_blank">00:45:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, as you said, certainly flying British airways itself long haul using well, using any points, actually almost any points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2757" target="_blank">00:45:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">They tack on these huge surcharges.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2759" target="_blank">00:45:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's a problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2761" target="_blank">00:46:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">The one exception there with using Avios is if you're flying British airways and booking through British airways, British airways often these days gives you an option of paying more miles and fewer surcharges.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2776" target="_blank">00:46:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So you might be able to book, you know, a business class flight to London from North America for, you know what, I don't know what the pricing is off the top of my head.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2786" target="_blank">00:46:26.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's say it's 60,000 Avios, but with high surcharges or you pay 85,000 Avios and low surcharges.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2795" target="_blank">00:46:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And I actually recently did that for my son for a flight that we're taking later this summer because I had found a really good deal for my wife and I, but there were only two seats using different miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2807" target="_blank">00:46:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, then I was like, oh, he wants to fly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2809" target="_blank">00:46:49.740</a></span> | <span class="t">He wants to go on this trip too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2811" target="_blank">00:46:51.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And oh my gosh, the, you know, the surcharge is so high.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2814" target="_blank">00:46:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But then I remembered that, okay, wait, if I look through British airways itself at the award, I might be able to, you know, just pay more Avios.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2822" target="_blank">00:47:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm willing to do that because all the Avios I have in my account have been accumulated from when there have been really big transfer bonuses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2829" target="_blank">00:47:09.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm talking 40% or more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2832" target="_blank">00:47:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2832" target="_blank">00:47:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, similar numbers, six to seven transfer bonuses a year to Avios.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2837" target="_blank">00:47:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And the fact that there are so many programs you can transfer to makes me feel like that number is going to be even higher going forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2844" target="_blank">00:47:24.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if there's a transfer bonus to thin air, well, great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2847" target="_blank">00:47:27.620</a></span> | <span class="t">That's also a transfer bonus to Qatar and British Airways and all that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2850" target="_blank">00:47:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2851" target="_blank">00:47:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And keep in mind the feature you just mentioned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2854" target="_blank">00:47:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the things you won't find with a lot of award search tools is stuff like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2859" target="_blank">00:47:39.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Knowing that you can go to British Airways' own site and buy down the fuel surcharge is not something that you'll probably see on award tool or points, yeah, or somewhere else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2868" target="_blank">00:47:48.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a really good call out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2870" target="_blank">00:47:50.220</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a really good point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2871" target="_blank">00:47:51.820</a></span> | <span class="t">If you are eliminating flights from your searches, all those tools let you say, you know, I don't want to see flights that have more than X amount of dollars in surcharges.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2882" target="_blank">00:48:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're doing that, you might be missing some opportunities for awards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2886" target="_blank">00:48:06.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2887" target="_blank">00:48:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, let's try to do a rapid fire here where we're not going to go into as much length because, you know, we kind of hit on the programs that I think are among the best, unless I missed any.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2897" target="_blank">00:48:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm going to run through a few of the commonly transferable airlines, maybe give me a couple bullets on whether they are or are not a good use or things people should explore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2908" target="_blank">00:48:28.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll start with Emirates, which has been unable to transfer to for a while while I think they upgraded tech, but it seems like it's back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2916" target="_blank">00:48:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2916" target="_blank">00:48:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But is it is it something people should be using or looking at much for one specific purpose, use Emirates miles to fly from New York to Milan in business class or from Newark to Athens in business class for a reasonable number of miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2935" target="_blank">00:48:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then at the airport, ask to upgrade when you go to check in at the airport, ask to upgrade to first class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2943" target="_blank">00:49:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You throw in some more Emirates miles to fly in first class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2946" target="_blank">00:49:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's how my wife and I recently flew Emirates first class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2949" target="_blank">00:49:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But aside from that, I don't know of any good, really good uses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2952" target="_blank">00:49:12.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, they rarely have a transfer bonus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2955" target="_blank">00:49:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The miles do expire, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2956" target="_blank">00:49:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2957" target="_blank">00:49:17.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2958" target="_blank">00:49:18.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, don't transfer until you're ready to use it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2963" target="_blank">00:49:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can even if in that airport example, as long as transfers are back and working, which I believe they are, you don't have to transfer the miles in the hope that you'll get upgraded at the airport.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2974" target="_blank">00:49:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">What you do is you ask at the airport, can I upgrade with miles?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2977" target="_blank">00:49:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">If they say yes, then transfer the amount of miles you need right then and there, then you should be good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2983" target="_blank">00:49:43.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2984" target="_blank">00:49:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of the transfer programs now, and we might call out a couple exceptions, are pretty instant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2990" target="_blank">00:49:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I think ANA is the most notorious one of taking a while, but most of them are instant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=2995" target="_blank">00:49:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And you could probably search online pretty easily, Emirates transfer time, and you'll probably get an answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3001" target="_blank">00:50:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But I

don't transfer speculatively for an upgrade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3005" target="_blank">00:50:05.240</a></span> | <span

fact that you can't use partner miles to book Singapore first class or Singapore suites.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3119" target="_blank">00:51:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if your heart is set on trying Singapore's first class or first class suites, then you need Singapore miles to book that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3128" target="_blank">00:52:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But even then, it's hard to find

some programs, they might expire, but if you transferred 1,000 miles or you made a donation or you bought a magazine, you can kind of sometimes extend those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="t">I'm not sure exactly where the cutoff is, but if you're flying from an eastern city to London on British Airways with Cathay Pacific miles, surcharges are very, very low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3212" target="_blank">00:53:32.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think they're less than $200, and that was exactly, actually, when I mentioned before that my wife and I booked a flight and then I had to find a way to get my son on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3220" target="_blank">00:53:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I had booked us using Cathay Pacific miles, but there were only two seats available to partners from that British Airways flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3229" target="_blank">00:53:49.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So then I had to get on British Airways and find one that was available to British Airways themselves for the third seat for my son.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3235" target="_blank">00:53:55.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyway, so that can be a great deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3238" target="_blank">00:53:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Another good use is flying Cathay Pacific itself because you'll find better award availability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3244" target="_blank">00:54:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So award prices aren't amazing, but again, if they are compared to the cash rates, if you can find business or first class to fly to Hong Kong or beyond, Hong Kong is where they're based, then that can be a great deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3259" target="_blank">00:54:19.900</a></span> | <span class="t">They have an interesting award chart where it's distance based, but it has a limit to how far that distance goes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3267" target="_blank">00:54:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So what happens is when you go further than the top band of the distance chart, they don't charge more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3274" target="_blank">00:54:34.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason that's interesting is that they average the award based on what cabin you flew, how far you flew each cabin of service.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3284" target="_blank">00:54:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you fly 50% in economy and 50% in business class, the award price will be half of what economy price would be and half of what the business class price would be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3296" target="_blank">00:54:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I know this is very complicated, but what this means is like sometimes if you fly further, the award price goes down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3303" target="_blank">00:55:03.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's say you want to fly first class from Chicago to Hong Kong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3307" target="_blank">00:55:07.300</a></span> | <span class="t">You're already at the top of the word chart distance band now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3309" target="_blank">00:55:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">If you fly further, let's say you fly all the way to South Africa in a lower cabin, you fly in business class instead of first class or economy instead of first class, that'll bring the award price down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3321" target="_blank">00:55:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're still flowing that just as far in first class as the original price, but now because you're going further, the award price goes down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3329" target="_blank">00:55:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It's crazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3330" target="_blank">00:55:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, some of these charts have these nuances where it's like when you figure them out, you did a whole episode I'll link to that's like flying further to save.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3337" target="_blank">00:55:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, yeah, I'll link to that if people want to go deeper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3340" target="_blank">00:55:40.820</a></span> | <span class="t">The Cathay does have transfer bonuses, but they're usually 10 to 20%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3345" target="_blank">00:55:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">There's not transfer bonuses there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3347" target="_blank">00:55:47.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So not going to outsized value waiting for them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3351" target="_blank">00:55:51.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But if one's happening, definitely take advantage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3354" target="_blank">00:55:54.220</a></span> | <span class="t">This is just not one to keep your miles in to, you know, to hoard miles into this program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3359" target="_blank">00:55:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">The uses for it are too specific.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3362" target="_blank">00:56:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So now the next one, pretty common, you know, Amex Capital One City is Avianca Life Miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3369" target="_blank">00:56:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll keep this in the, it has a ton of partners before we kind of go into the niche ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3374" target="_blank">00:56:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think it definitely has the most transfer bonuses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3377" target="_blank">00:56:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, there've been years as many as 12 transfer bonuses in one year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3381" target="_blank">00:56:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you think about Life Mile?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3383" target="_blank">00:56:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it a program you use a lot?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3384" target="_blank">00:56:24.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't because it's kind of a pain to work with in a number of ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3388" target="_blank">00:56:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't think we should dive into all the ways it's a pain to work with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3394" target="_blank">00:56:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But let's talk about some of its advantages first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3396" target="_blank">00:56:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't charge fuel surcharges on any award flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3399" target="_blank">00:56:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">That's also true, by the way, with Air Canada Aeroplane.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3402" target="_blank">00:56:42.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I forgot to mention earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3403" target="_blank">00:56:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3405" target="_blank">00:56:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They have some great pricing, but it's kind of all over the place in that sometimes there's like incredible deals to a particular city.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3416" target="_blank">00:56:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Like they don't have a consistent award price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3419" target="_blank">00:56:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">They seem to like, it seems like, you know, most awards to Europe cost this much, but then you might find a particular city where, oh, it's even less if you go there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3427" target="_blank">00:57:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's great if you can find it, if it works for you, but it's, it's inconsistent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3433" target="_blank">00:57:13.580</a></span> | <span class="t">High change fees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3434" target="_blank">00:57:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I hate that, that unless you subscribe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3439" target="_blank">00:57:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So unless you pay monthly into their program for like extra benefits, you have to pay very high change fees and cancellation fees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3447" target="_blank">00:57:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">That's probably my number one thing that kind of keeps me away from investing too much in this program is that like, well, all right, they're difficult to work with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3456" target="_blank">00:57:36.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And unless I really buy into them, which I don't want to do on a program that's difficult to work with, you have these high change fees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3463" target="_blank">00:57:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So for me, it's just too common for me to want to change, you know, a flight to want to deal with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3471" target="_blank">00:57:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3471" target="_blank">00:57:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I made a, well, TBD, if it's a mistake yet, but there was a hundred percent transfer bonus with built.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3478" target="_blank">00:57:58.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I moved over a hundred thousand or 150,000 points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3482" target="_blank">00:58:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have about 300,000 life miles right now and I haven't been able to use them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3487" target="_blank">00:58:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And not because I haven't tried, but there's been a trip and it was like, oh, well, it's not a bad deal with life miles,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3492" target="_blank">00:58:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but we're not a hundred percent sure we're going to take it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3495" target="_blank">00:58:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">If we cancel, it's going to cost us hundreds and hundreds of dollars or we subscribe to this thing for six months and we just spend hundreds of dollars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3503" target="_blank">00:58:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And you want to make that decision in advance because it also gets you a discount on the flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3509" target="_blank">00:58:29.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And it just felt like there were enough gotchas that we didn't end up using it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3513" target="_blank">00:58:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I will find a way to use it because, you know, 300,000 life miles is not worth nothing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3518" target="_blank">00:58:38.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, no, no, definitely not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3521" target="_blank">00:58:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And I know your co-host, Nick, has used life miles a ton and you can get value out of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3526" target="_blank">00:58:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But I would say there are reasons to find it a pain that have prevented me from getting value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3533" target="_blank">00:58:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3534" target="_blank">00:58:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3534" target="_blank">00:58:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, with a hundred percent transfer bonus, I mean, that's a great deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3539" target="_blank">00:58:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can keep miles alive by, you know, if they're about to expire after, I forget what their policy is, 12 months or 18 months or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3548" target="_blank">00:59:08.020</a></span> | <span class="t">They're pretty low timeframe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3550" target="_blank">00:59:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you just transfer another thousand miles in from any of the programs that support it, you can reset the clock on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3557" target="_blank">00:59:17.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So you don't have to use them right away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3559" target="_blank">00:59:19.300</a></span> | <span class="t">You could wait for the ideal situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3561" target="_blank">00:59:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are really great prices under certain circumstances.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3565" target="_blank">00:59:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And most of the time I have booked with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3568" target="_blank">00:59:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But most of the time when I look, I'm like, you know what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3571" target="_blank">00:59:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Air Canada is easy to deal with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3573" target="_blank">00:59:33.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And the price isn't that much better than booking with Air Canada or even United in some cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3579" target="_blank">00:59:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yes, I regret doing that because months later, the opportunity was to do a hundred percent transfer bonus to Air Canada.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3586" target="_blank">00:59:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, that is a story for another day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3588" target="_blank">00:59:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The only other airline that has kind of a ton of partners at often different rates, but I think it'll be a very quick answer from you, is JetBlue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3598" target="_blank">00:59:58.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that ever a program that you've transferred to?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3600" target="_blank">01:00:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I haven't transferred to because I have a lot of JetBlue points from credit card bonuses and other deals that have happened along the years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3609" target="_blank">01:00:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, JetBlue has a bunch of random partners now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3612" target="_blank">01:00:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You can book a lot of international airlines with JetBlue points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3616" target="_blank">01:00:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The pricing isn't fantastic, but it's actually not bad at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3620" target="_blank">01:00:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And the great thing is completely free to change and cancel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3625" target="_blank">01:00:25.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So I would much rather transfer to JetBlue to book a flight that's also bookable with Avios because none of the Avios programs have free cancellations.</span></div><div class="c"><span

JetBlue Mint to New York from San Francisco.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3644" target="_blank">01:00:44.520</a></span> | <span

booking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3658" target="_blank">01:00:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3691" target="_blank">01:01:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">That's possible too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

into some of these more obscure programs that have a couple transfer partners, but not all of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3716" target="_blank">01:01:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And some of them will be really fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3718" target="_blank">01:01:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can do some of them really quick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3720" target="_blank">01:02:00.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll even take a stab unless things change with some of these future partnerships.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3724" target="_blank">01:02:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Southwest points, you could transfer from Chase and built.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3728" target="_blank">01:02:08.280</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3736" target="_blank">01:02:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But unless these Icelandair partnership or future kind of agreements take any footing, I don't see any reason personally to be transferring points to Southwest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3744" target="_blank">01:02:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3745" target="_blank">01:02:25.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Although things change a little bit recently because they've changed their model for how they price the points on awards just recently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3753" target="_blank">01:02:33.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div

flights, you might get better award value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3762" target="_blank">01:02:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Like when Nick looked at it, he was saying, gosh, I want to say up to 1.8 cents per point value, maybe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3770" target="_blank">01:02:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Like that was really rare, but it can happen that you get more in the higher range where it could make sense to transfer when you see that opportunity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3779" target="_blank">01:02:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But my God, do not transfer just hoping that that'll happen because, you know, the whole reason they have this variable pricing structure is because most people are going to get actually worse pricing than before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3791" target="_blank">01:03:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">They're not better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3792" target="_blank">01:03:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3792" target="_blank">01:03:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Every time I've used my Southwest points, I've just been like, well, it's going to be 1.3, 1.4 cents per point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3798" target="_blank">01:03:18.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I already have them from earning points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3800" target="_blank">01:03:20.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Keep in mind one other important thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3802" target="_blank">01:03:22.420</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're comparing things to booking in a travel portal, you will actually usually earn points on the flights you book in the travel portal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3809" target="_blank">01:03:29.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at something and you're like, well, it's about break even, you know, yes, there is some hassle of booking in a travel portal that might result in, you know, tricky things to change flights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3819" target="_blank">01:03:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But you will usually earn points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3821" target="_blank">01:03:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You will usually earn kind of status qualifying, you know, credits, whatever the airline has booking in a portal versus if you're booking with points on Southwest, you're not earning points at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3832" target="_blank">01:03:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3832" target="_blank">01:03:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So obviously, if you just have them in your Southwest program, you've got to use them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3836" target="_blank">01:03:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But transferring, I feel like there's so many other places that you might get better value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3841" target="_blank">01:04:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3842" target="_blank">01:04:02.360</a></span> | <span class="t">A few others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3843" target="_blank">01:04:03.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll hit on some that I think are going to be quick ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3845" target="_blank">01:04:05.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Etihad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3847" target="_blank">01:04:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So Etihad often looks like it has good award pricing on short partner flights, like short American Airlines flights, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3854" target="_blank">01:04:14.480</a></span> | <span

it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3856" target="_blank">01:04:16.220</a></span> | <span class="t">There's too many downsides to using Etihad miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3859" target="_blank">01:04:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">No reason for us

target="_blank">01:04:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The one use, the one place where I'd be tempted to move miles to Etihad is Etihad first class apartments is one of the most amazing ways to fly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3874" target="_blank">01:04:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You can get much better award availability to fly Etihad first apartments with Etihad's own miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3880" target="_blank">01:04:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you have a special trip in mind and you don't mind spending like 200,000 points one way per person, you can probably find the exact flight you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3890" target="_blank">01:04:50.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So I would do it for that as long as you're confident you're going to actually fly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=3894"

Turkish, you might need to do some searching and kind of read up on all the gotchas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4004" target="_blank">01:06:44.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But, yeah, and unless you're lucky, like, the one time I used Turkish miles, I was able to book a United flight, no problem.</span></div><div

target="_blank">01:07:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so now we're on to a couple of the more rare ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4025" target="_blank">01:07:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But United is a partner of Chase & Built.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4027" target="_blank">01:07:07.060</a></span> | <span class="t">We talked about how they have free cancellations.</span></div><div

some partners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4034" target="_blank">01:07:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">They have never had a transfer bonus from a credit card program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4038" target="_blank">01:07:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you use United as a transfer partner ever?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4040" target="_blank">01:07:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I have, yeah, absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4042" target="_blank">01:07:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Their prices have crept up over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4044" target="_blank">01:07:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So pre-pandemic, they were, I think, business class of Europe was around 70,000 miles, if I remember correctly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4053" target="_blank">01:07:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember specifically, we had a big trip with a lot of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4057" target="_blank">01:07:37.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted to book with, I think it was 63,000 Avianca life miles, but I couldn't get the award to show up on Avianca's website.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4065" target="_blank">01:07:45.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So I transferred to United instead and booked that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4069" target="_blank">01:07:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't that much more expensive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4070" target="_blank">01:07:50.740</a></span> | <span class="t">As things stand right now, as you mentioned, Chris, a lot of times United's miles are the only way to book United itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4079" target="_blank">01:07:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's good for that longer distance flights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4084" target="_blank">01:08:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you compare Air Canada prices to book Star Alliance flights to United, Air Canada is usually better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4091" target="_blank">01:08:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But as you get longer distance, United has spots where it's better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4097" target="_blank">01:08:17.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, when I've looked Detroit to the Middle East, Air Canada jumps into the 90,000 point one way zone for business class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4106" target="_blank">01:08:26.140</a></span> | <span class="t">United's at 80,000.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4107" target="_blank">01:08:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are definitely situations like that where United is maybe not the best as far as pricing, because maybe life miles would have been cheaper in that case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4118" target="_blank">01:08:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4119" target="_blank">01:08:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But United is very easy to use their miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4122" target="_blank">01:08:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You can cancel last minute and get all your miles back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4125" target="_blank">01:08:45.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I think United might be the one airline where you can even cancel after you miss the flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4131" target="_blank">01:08:51.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4132" target="_blank">01:08:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Pay $150 and get your miles back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4135" target="_blank">01:08:55.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So I thought that was like one of the most generous tricks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4138" target="_blank">01:08:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But that free cancellation is really a valuable thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4142" target="_blank">01:09:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It really is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4144" target="_blank">01:09:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've used that a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4145" target="_blank">01:09:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I mentioned booking before the pandemic, a whole bunch of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4148" target="_blank">01:09:08.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have this huge stash of United miles because that trip never happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4152" target="_blank">01:09:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I got all those miles back and I use them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4156" target="_blank">01:09:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">They're so valuable as a placeholder for what we talked about before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4161" target="_blank">01:09:21.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I always have enough United miles to book that good enough flight to wherever I'm going so that I can wait until a better deal shows up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4172" target="_blank">01:09:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I find that really valuable to have that placeholder until I find a better deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4176" target="_blank">01:09:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And someday, maybe I won't find a better deal and I'll actually use those miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4180" target="_blank">01:09:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But in the meantime, I like having that slush fund of United miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4184" target="_blank">01:09:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">The last one I'll mention is EVA or EVA Air.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4188" target="_blank">01:09:48.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I have flown them in the past, but never using their own miles, which I understand, you know, you get a lot more inventory with their miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4196" target="_blank">01:09:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">They only transfer from Citi and Capital One.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4198" target="_blank">01:09:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">They've never had a transfer bonus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4200" target="_blank">01:10:00.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Have you ever taken advantage of, you know, booking their flights with their own inventory?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4204" target="_blank">01:10:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Never.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4205" target="_blank">01:10:05.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've actually never flown them at all either.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4208" target="_blank">01:10:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, I mean, that's a great opportunity, especially because flights to Asia, award flights to Asia have become so difficult lately to find.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4218" target="_blank">01:10:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so having a program that has pretty wide open availability just about any time to its own members at good award prices is really nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4230" target="_blank">01:10:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Unfortunately, when you transfer from Citi, it can take a couple of days for the transfer to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4234" target="_blank">01:10:34.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, their website is horrible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4238" target="_blank">01:10:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so understanding whether an award is available or not, figuring out how to book family members is just absurdly complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4247" target="_blank">01:10:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So Tim wrote a nice post about how all that works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4251" target="_blank">01:10:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're interested in doing that, check out Tim's post on Frequent Miler about this topic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4258" target="_blank">01:10:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But that is one where I think an award tool might not show that availability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4262" target="_blank">01:11:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4263" target="_blank">01:11:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you're heart set on going to Asia and you're trying to find a deal and you have Capital One or Citi points, go find Tim's post and you might find some inventory you couldn't have found otherwise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4273" target="_blank">01:11:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4274" target="_blank">01:11:14.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, totally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4275" target="_blank">01:11:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, Capital One doesn't transfer one-to-one, but it's probably still, if you're just out of luck finding, you know, those flights, then that still could be worth it because they can't do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4286" target="_blank">01:11:26.980</a></span> | <span class="t">The few other airlines, I don't want to spend a lot of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4289" target="_blank">01:11:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll skip Delta.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4290" target="_blank">01:11:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We kind of talked about the Delta experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4292" target="_blank">01:11:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You can get to Delta from Amex, but hard to get outsized value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4295" target="_blank">01:11:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Never had a transfer bonus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4296" target="_blank">01:11:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I mentioned ANA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4298" target="_blank">01:11:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I know it takes a while to transfer there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4301" target="_blank">01:11:41.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So my experience has always been I'm scared because award availability changes so frequently that if I initiate a transfer and have to wait a few days to book something, you know, I won't have it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4313" target="_blank">01:11:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">They lost their round the world awards, which was something that people loved them for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4318" target="_blank">01:11:58.640</a></span> | <span

| <span class="t">They still have very good award pricing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4325" target="_blank">01:12:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">They now allow one-way awards now or soon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4329" target="_blank">01:12:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't remember if it's taken effect yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4332" target="_blank">01:12:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you want to book Star Alliance for a good price, you can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4337" target="_blank">01:12:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Unfortunately, they pass along surcharges.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4340" target="_blank">01:12:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So unless you're flying an airline that doesn't impose surcharges, it's not likely to be a good deal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4346" target="_blank">01:12:26.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was all a way of saying there are situations where you could get a great, a very good deal with ANA, but I would not.</span></div><div

4,500 points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4477" target="_blank">01:14:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">4,500.</span></div><div

them, like, around the holidays for a $500 flight being available for 4,500 Alaska miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4490"

target="_blank">01:14:52.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I just booked multiple flights to London on American Airlines using Alaska miles, 45,000 miles to go Detroit to Chicago to London.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4503" target="_blank">01:15:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just ridiculous how good

that example is that you get much better value from the East Coast U.S., even though that's a West Coast-based airline, because of the way their distance-based award chart works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4520" target="_blank">01:15:20.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I won't dwell more because I am a fan.</span></div><div

that comes out in the summer that they've talked about is out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4529" target="_blank">01:15:29.980</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, Hawaiian cards will probably, my guess is, be closed for new applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4533" target="_blank">01:15:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But I would say if you can get access to points that transfer to Alaska or you can get Alaska points themselves, I'm a fan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4542" target="_blank">01:15:42.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's going to be harder and harder with losing Amex going to Hawaiian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4546" target="_blank">01:15:46.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So good luck.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4549" target="_blank">01:15:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So we didn't talk much about hotels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4552" target="_blank">01:15:52.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's a little bit on purpose because for the most part, and we'll talk about the glaring exception here, which I'm sure you know, most hotel points in general are just not as valuable as airline miles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4566" target="_blank">01:16:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I looked, you guys do a reasonable redemption value, and it seems like almost every airline mile has a redemption value of greater than one cent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4576" target="_blank">01:16:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Hyatt is the one exception, and they're a chase and built transfer partner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4588" target="_blank">01:16:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So I definitely want to highlight why Hyatt can be such an excellent value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4594" target="_blank">01:16:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And then maybe we run through really briefly on whether there is any value to be had transferring points to any of the other programs, but not dwell on them too much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4604" target="_blank">01:16:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if you want hotel points often, you're better off accumulating them with hotel cards and hotel signup bonuses than as transfer partners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4612" target="_blank">01:16:52.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And obviously staying in the chains, but let's start with Hyatt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4615" target="_blank">01:16:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I mean, Hyatt just has great value for their own hotels, middling value for their Mr. and Mrs. Smith partnership.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4623" target="_blank">01:17:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So I wouldn't, I wouldn't get excited about transferring to Hyatt for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4628" target="_blank">01:17:08.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're going to book a Hyatt hotel, there's a very good chance that you can get a great value for your points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4635" target="_blank">01:17:15.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So definitely check that out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4637" target="_blank">01:17:17.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4638" target="_blank">01:17:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I know a lot of people who kind of consider their chase points, Hyatt points, and don't really even consider United, for example, as a transfer partner, because they'd rather use Air Canada because all the points go to Air Canada.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4653" target="_blank">01:17:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Even if United's a better deal, because using chase points for United means losing points that could go to Hyatt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4659" target="_blank">01:17:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Right, right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4661" target="_blank">01:17:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's because you can't transfer from like Amex to United, where people tend to have a lot of points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4667" target="_blank">01:17:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So they use their Amex points and transfer to Air Canada.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4670" target="_blank">01:17:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4670" target="_blank">01:17:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4671" target="_blank">01:17:51.220</a></span> | <span class="t">No, that's a totally sound thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4673" target="_blank">01:17:53.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's, you know, 90% my approach as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4676" target="_blank">01:17:56.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I mentioned earlier, I have transferred to United.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4678" target="_blank">01:17:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That was quite a while ago now.</span></div><div

then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4682" target="_blank">01:18:02.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4683" target="_blank">01:18:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So in my mind, chase points are pretty much just Hyatt points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4686" target="_blank">01:18:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I love that you can book suites with

Hyatt, you know, the upgrade awards that let you confirm suites and upgrade them are fantastic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4696"

<span class="t">Independent of IHG, the program on its own, but as a transfer partner, from my perspective, it's one-to-one from Chase and Bilt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4747" target="_blank">01:19:07.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It just holds nothing to Hyatt as an alternative.</span></div><div class="c"><span

a cent each.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4761" target="_blank">01:19:21.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you wanted to transfer, let's say, your Chase points to IHG, you can just redeem your Chase points for pennies and then get 100% transfer bonus by buying IHG points for half a cent each when they're on sale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4776" target="_blank">01:19:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4776" target="_blank">01:19:36.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can have 100% transfer bonus much more often than Chase will ever offer even a 70% transfer bonus, which we've seen, I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4784" target="_blank">01:19:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I'd make a similar case that Hilton points are about the same value and about the same frequency of being able to buy them for half a cent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4792" target="_blank">01:19:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But the transfer rate from Amex is one-to-two, and they often do a transfer bonus a couple times a year, 25%, 40%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4801" target="_blank">01:20:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't usually think of transferring Amex points to Hilton, but I remember there were a few people I knew who got Amex shutdowns, and they were like, well, I think I'm just going to move everything to Hilton.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4810" target="_blank">01:20:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what do you think about, as Amex, you don't have access to Hyatt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4814" target="_blank">01:20:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Is Hilton a good transfer partner for Amex as a way to use your points?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4819" target="_blank">01:20:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think especially when there's a transfer bonus, I think it's a really reasonable way to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4824" target="_blank">01:20:24.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Hilton, especially now that they've partnered with Small Luxury Hotels of the World, SLH, they've opened them up to really good value, meaning you can often get one cent per point value or more from your Hilton points, which is really important to understand that Hilton points are more often worth about half a cent each.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4841" target="_blank">01:20:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you see one cent, that's like double value, or another way of putting it is if you transferred from Amex one to two, which is the normal transfer rate, then you're getting like two cents per Amex point or more value in those situations, or better if you did during a transfer bonus, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4860" target="_blank">01:21:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a good use if you're into luxury hotels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4864" target="_blank">01:21:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">At the sort of more medium, lower end, you're going to find fewer opportunities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4868" target="_blank">01:21:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">There are opportunities, but there's going to be fewer to use Hilton.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4871" target="_blank">01:21:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, they have done some recent devaluations on that high end, but they also do have fifth night free.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4878" target="_blank">01:21:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So keep that in mind when you're thinking about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4881" target="_blank">01:21:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">If it's a five night stay at a high end hotel during a transfer bonus, it could be a good use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4885" target="_blank">01:21:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">If it's a one night stay, no transfer bonus might be a little trickier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4890" target="_blank">01:21:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I spent a lot of years staying at Marriott Properties.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4894" target="_blank">01:21:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I still have never transferred points because again, like IHG, it's a one to one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4899" target="_blank">01:21:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Their points are worth less than a cent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4900" target="_blank">01:21:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, they do have some transfer bonuses and fifth night free, but it just seems like the math has never worked out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4906" target="_blank">01:21:46.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4908" target="_blank">01:21:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And you'll sometimes see good value from your Marriott points, but it's just not predictable enough to want to even consider transferring one to one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4916" target="_blank">01:21:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I wouldn't do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4918" target="_blank">01:21:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the last one is one that I think the first time I've ever opened up a credit card just for transfer partners was that I'd never held city points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4926" target="_blank">01:22:06.300</a></span> | <span class="t">There weren't any kind of unique things that city had on the airline front except a better ratio to Eva Air.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4933" target="_blank">01:22:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's not easy to accumulate, you know, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of city points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4937" target="_blank">01:22:17.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But they do have Leaders Club and Preferred Hotels as two partners for hotels that seem like there might be some value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4945" target="_blank">01:22:25.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Have you gotten value?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4946" target="_blank">01:22:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I know you have city cards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4949" target="_blank">01:22:29.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4949" target="_blank">01:22:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, there's also the one to two transfer rate to Choice, which can also be used to book preferred hotels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4956" target="_blank">01:22:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there are two different ways to book preferred hotels with city points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4961" target="_blank">01:22:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">One is to transfer to Choice, one to two, and then book from there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4966" target="_blank">01:22:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The other is to transfer to iPrefer, which is preferred hotels' own program at a one to four rate, which is pretty amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4972" target="_blank">01:22:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yes, there are amazing deals to be had with that preferred hotels transfer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4979" target="_blank">01:22:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">There are good deals to be had with that Choice transfer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4983" target="_blank">01:23:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The problem with the preferred hotels transfer is that preferred hotels, their rewards program is not ready for primetime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4992" target="_blank">01:23:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That's being generous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4994" target="_blank">01:23:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's been really bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4996" target="_blank">01:23:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It's getting better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=4997" target="_blank">01:23:17.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Often, like, the searches don't for, you know, free nights just don't work correctly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5002" target="_blank">01:23:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">If you get past that and get to where you can actually book a hotel, you may encounter issues where the hotel tries to charge you, again, that cash rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5012" target="_blank">01:23:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">That happened to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5013" target="_blank">01:23:33.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I worked through it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5014" target="_blank">01:23:34.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But the point is, like, it's as far from friction-free as it can get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5020" target="_blank">01:23:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, if you're chasing value, there is value to be had, some amazing value, but be ready for some frustration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5026" target="_blank">01:23:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Leaders' club is easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5027" target="_blank">01:23:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So, leaders' club is kind of a fixed value in a way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5030" target="_blank">01:23:50.900</a></span> | <span class="t">From city to leaders' club, the transfer ratio is five to one, which sounds terrible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5036" target="_blank">01:23:56.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you end up with 20% leaders' club points that you started with and city points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5040" target="_blank">01:24:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But each leaders' club point is worth around $0.08.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5043" target="_blank">01:24:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it actually works out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5045" target="_blank">01:24:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Math works out to getting, like, I forget what it is exactly, like, $1.65 maybe per point from your city points, which is not amazing, but it's good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5055" target="_blank">01:24:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">My experience, I've only booked one, but my experience with booking a leaders' club, leading hotel of the world hotel, using leaders' club points, was very good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5065" target="_blank">01:24:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You join their leaders' club, and that automatically gives you benefits, like breakfast and upgrade and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5070" target="_blank">01:24:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I actually got all of those things and used my city points to book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5075" target="_blank">01:24:35.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I had a very good experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5077" target="_blank">01:24:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">The number of properties available to book with points isn't huge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5080" target="_blank">01:24:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you really have to, you know, look at what's available and see if it'll work for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5085" target="_blank">01:24:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But the possibilities are good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5087" target="_blank">01:24:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5088" target="_blank">01:24:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5088" target="_blank">01:24:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">For some reason, I skipped over choice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5090" target="_blank">01:24:50.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we mentioned that choice for preferred hotels can be interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5093" target="_blank">01:24:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're sitting on Amex or CapOne points, and you can go one-to-one to choice, just like a lot of the other hotel programs, don't do it, not worth it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5101" target="_blank">01:25:01.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5102" target="_blank">01:25:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they had one transfer bonus ever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5104" target="_blank">01:25:04.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And even then, choice points, you know, are not worth that one-to-one ratio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5110" target="_blank">01:25:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5110" target="_blank">01:25:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You can sometimes find choice-as-own hotels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5113" target="_blank">01:25:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You might be getting as much as a penny per point value, sometimes a little bit more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5117" target="_blank">01:25:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, that's not great value for your transferable points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5122" target="_blank">01:25:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're transferring one to two, then it becomes interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5125" target="_blank">01:25:25.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And that you can do from Citibank or Wells Fargo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5128" target="_blank">01:25:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5128" target="_blank">01:25:28.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5129" target="_blank">01:25:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We didn't talk about Wells Fargo much because I think they only have Virgin Atlantic, Avios, Flying Blue, Life Miles, and Choice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5136" target="_blank">01:25:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a very small portfolio, none of which are kind of unique, though that one-to-two ratio is probably the only thing that kind of stands out as differentiated other than Citi.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5147" target="_blank">01:25:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I didn't mention Accor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5150" target="_blank">01:25:50.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Similarly, my understanding, Accor points are kind of fixed in value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5153" target="_blank">01:25:53.220</a></span> | <span class="t">You've got to transfer two to one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5154" target="_blank">01:25:54.980</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5164" target="_blank">01:26:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5167" target="_blank">01:26:07.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5167" target="_blank">01:26:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I totally agree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5168" target="_blank">01:26:08.540</a></span> | <span class="t">This was a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5169" target="_blank">01:26:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So if people need to go back in the timestamps and find other airlines and get excited, by all means, do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5176" target="_blank">01:26:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">The one thing that I noticed in some programs is you really want to make sure you have your program set up in advance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5183" target="_blank">01:26:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, for example, some airlines don't let you book right away after creating a frequent flyer account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5190" target="_blank">01:26:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Some airlines, you know, your names might not match perfectly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5194" target="_blank">01:26:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So you want to make sure that maybe you opened an account a long time ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5198" target="_blank">01:26:38.340</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, for me, I sometimes, is it Christopher?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5200" target="_blank">01:26:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it Chris?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5201" target="_blank">01:26:41.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you know, if you have a junior or a suffix, that could be a challenge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5205" target="_blank">01:26:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So the one tip, and I wonder if there's anything I'm missing, is take an hour and just open up a few accounts at the programs you might think, after listening to this episode, you'd want to transfer for, just to have them set up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5217" target="_blank">01:26:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And do that in advance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5220" target="_blank">01:27:00.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you're working with a partner and they have miles, maybe do it for both of you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5223" target="_blank">01:27:03.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that can be important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5226" target="_blank">01:27:06.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can go in and link them to your Chase and your Amex account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5230" target="_blank">01:27:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes that check of whether the names match happens at linking so you can find out if there are issues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5236" target="_blank">01:27:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Just so that when you find that availability, you're not thinking, oh, gosh, I want to go book this flight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5241" target="_blank">01:27:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I just found it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5242" target="_blank">01:27:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I've got to create an Air France account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5244" target="_blank">01:27:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I linked them and the names don't match.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5246" target="_blank">01:27:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I've got to fix it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5247" target="_blank">01:27:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And especially I'd recommend going through the multiple Avios programs, Iberia, British Airways, Qatar, Finnair, and set all those up and make sure that your name, email address, and phone number, home address, all that stuff matches exactly across all of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5266" target="_blank">01:27:46.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason that's so important with those is that you have to have that exact matchup in order to move your Avios around from one program to another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5274" target="_blank">01:27:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, Iberia in particular, you can't book awards until your account has been, I can't remember, let's say six months old.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5282" target="_blank">01:28:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So the sooner you do that, the better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5285" target="_blank">01:28:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, there's one last thing that I can't believe I forgot to mention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5289" target="_blank">01:28:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll just ask you, even though I know the answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5292" target="_blank">01:28:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's say you transfer miles from Amex to an airline or a hotel group and you decide, I didn't really want them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5299" target="_blank">01:28:19.700</a></span> | <span class="t">How easy is it to reverse that process?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5301" target="_blank">01:28:21.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it's easy to find out that you can't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5306" target="_blank">01:28:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You can't do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5307" target="_blank">01:28:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a one-way, one-way trip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5309" target="_blank">01:28:29.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why we keep saying, like, don't do it unless you find the award that you want to book and you're ready to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5314" target="_blank">01:28:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5315" target="_blank">01:28:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5315" target="_blank">01:28:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Many of these transfers are instant, but irreversible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5318" target="_blank">01:28:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think really make sure you find that availability beforehand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5322" target="_blank">01:28:42.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But hopefully, listening to Greg and I talk about these will open up everyone's eyes to the fact that, yes, booking in the portal might feel easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5332" target="_blank">01:28:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you could just search for a flight, find it, and book it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5334" target="_blank">01:28:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And using transfer partners might be harder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5337" target="_blank">01:28:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Go back and look at the episode we did, Running Through Travel Tools for Searching for Award Flights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5341" target="_blank">01:29:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think you'd be surprised that it is easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5344" target="_blank">01:29:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But understanding the programs, I think, is the first thing to kind of make it a little easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5349" target="_blank">01:29:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through all this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI1CBxBJzOs&t=5352" target="_blank">01:29:12.400</a></span> | <span
