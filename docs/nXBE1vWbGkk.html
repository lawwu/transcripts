But of course the people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2698">00:44:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">on cable news would have nothing to say if that was the end of it. And so look, I think both the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2703">00:45:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">right and the left kind of went off the rails on this where you're the right kind of went off the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2708">00:45:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">rails is you had, well, yeah.

The jewel, the, the judge ruled against that motion,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2736">00:45:36.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but he did. The judge reiterated his desire for the politicians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2739">00:45:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">To stop talking about the case. Right. And so then what happened is the right-wing commentators</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2745">00:45:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">were criticizing Maxine waters and implying that, that there was an effort to try and coerce the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2751">00:45:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">jury. And there's no proof of that. Right. And, and, and, and I think there's the mistake is in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2757">00:45:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">somehow framing the Derek Chauvin as like a sacrificial lamb to the mob.

That being said, I do think that the judge had a point that it would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2769">00:46:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">be helpful if these politicians would just stay out of it, stop commenting on it while the jury</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2774">00:46:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is deliberating. I think there was a legit point there. Um, but you know, the, the, the, the left</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2780">00:46:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">made some, some weird comments as well. You had Nancy Pelosi made this really bizarre statement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2785">00:46:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That was very strange. I think that was like a slip up of like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2788">00:46:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">just trying to say something, not, I mean, being charitable, she was trying to say something nice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2793">00:46:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that George Floyd is going to create a wave of justice.

She said, yeah, she said, thank you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2801">00:46:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">George Floyd for sacrificing your life for, for justice.

Um, no, you know, and, um, and so it, it, it sort of gay, it expressed kind of what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2818">00:46:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">she's thinking, which is how am I going to use this politically? Uh, you know, train pretty gross.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2826">00:47:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you're right.

It's kind of like, you know, if you, if you take a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2831">00:47:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">finely tuned athlete in a sport and give them, you know, they're, they're just, they're reactive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2836">00:47:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">because they're so instinctual. I think it's kind of like this, she's an incredibly finely trained</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2841">00:47:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">athlete and her domain is politics. And so, you know, what is that phrase? Uh, uh, every crisis</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2847">00:47:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is an opportunity kind of thing. So I think, yeah, I mean, they all flew there to be there for the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2852">00:47:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">for the trial, et cetera. And that couldn't have helped the judge with, you know, the impartial</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2857">00:47:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">jury and maybe that causes a mistrial. I mean, I don't know, David, you were an attorney.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2860">00:47:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there any chance on appeal that a maxi water quote like that could result in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2867">00:47:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the judge, the judge actually said that, that the defense could reserve that issue and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2873">00:47:53.400</a></span> | <span class="t">use it on appeal. So yeah, they could use it, but I, but I don't think it's good. I don't think it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2877">00:47:57.240</a></span> | <span class="t">going to work unless they can prove that somehow the jury was contaminated by what they were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2882">00:48:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">hearing on TV or something like that. The judge's instructions were pretty clear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2886">00:48:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I watched a couple of the ending days and he's very clear. Like he's like, guys, I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2890">00:48:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">want you to watch the news. You know, there's stuff like that. He was very directive in making</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2893">00:48:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">sure that they tried to be as uncontaminated as possible. So I think the surface area for an appeal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2898">00:48:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is pretty thin here. The fact that the police chief and everybody who worked with him said like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2902">00:48:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this is not standard this, and they just threw him right under the bus. They didn't want to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2907">00:48:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">associated with this in any way. By the way, well, you know, they're,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2910">00:48:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">they're not going to be able to hide much longer though. Cause the DOJ said they're over, they're,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2912">00:48:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the DOJ said they're opening an investigation at the Minnesota police force. So I think they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2915">00:48:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">just trying to crack open the police reform in that state and just get those guys on the right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2919">00:48:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">side. And it's going to be, you know, again, here's this other issue where it's like, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2923">00:48:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this is where like there it's very difficult for the federal government to do anything,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2929">00:48:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">but you know, so whatever they try to do won't really result in what, what you want to have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2933">00:48:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">because every state, again, Jason, to your point has completely different political ideologies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=2938">00:48:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Nobody wants to behave the same.

So ultimately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=4560">01:16:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">good for you, because you want to see it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXBE1vWbGkk&t=4563">01:16:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and also, I think like the simpler path forward.
