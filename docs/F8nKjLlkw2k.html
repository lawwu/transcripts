It covers lots of different things. And for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of people like Mark, these things get all mixed up and they're thinking, "Well, I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">know. I'm sitting here journaling all day. Is this note-taking? What should I be doing? What</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">should I not be doing?" So what I want to do here is step back and let's give a general definition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">for note-taking. And then I want to highlight what I think the three critical types of note-taking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">systems you need in your life if you work any sort of knowledge job. And then we can, from there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">move on to talk about more advanced options. So let's define note-taking more generally to mean</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">recording information on a durable written medium. So anywhere you're collecting information in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">written medium that's durable, that will then, you have it outside of your head so you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">reference it later. Here are the three types of this note-taking that I think are critical,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">especially for most knowledge workers. One, some sort of working memory extender.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">This is where I use my text file on my desktop of my computer's workingmemory.txt. This is for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">strictly expanding the amount of information you can temporarily hold on to as you engage with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">inflow of information throughout your workday. So as things come in, you're in a meeting and people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">are suggesting next steps, you can just write this information down in whatever medium you use for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">your working memory extender, because it's probably more information you can keep in your head. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">there it is. I write it down right there. Or I'm going through my email inbox and I need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">remember different notes I need to act on, schedule this, get back to them. I can write it into my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">workingmemory.extender. These are notes that exist outside of your own brain, allows you to hold on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and organize more information than you could do just strictly within the confines of your own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">neurons. Now, this is something that resets all the time. It's a durable form, but you reset it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">all the time. So as I'm going through a meeting, I'm taking quick notes on here's the five things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I need to do. After that meeting, those notes will then get processed out of my working memory file</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">into calendar reminders into my obligation system. So it's a temporary storage, but it allows me in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the moment to keep track of more things that my brain can do on its own. That's note-taking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but of a very temporary type. Next comes what I just cited, which is your obligation tracker,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">some system to maintain all of the relevant information for every obligation on your plate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">This is also note-taking, written durable information that you don't have to keep track of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in your head. So somewhere here, all the things I have to do probably categorized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Here is all of the information related to each of these things all in this one place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You want that information accessible and captured somewhere. That's note-taking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Then finally, we get to what most people think of when they think about note-taking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and this is more where you're capturing key ideas about your work in your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It could be interesting ideas, interesting articles, brainstorms, concerns that you have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the broad category that captures what people normally think about in note-taking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I might be journaling my thoughts about things.

And this is where you're going to use whatever type of system you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">like to capture things in.

I use Trello for obligation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">tracking notes, one board per role, one column per type of obligation, one card per obligation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">all of the relevant information for that obligation on the card.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And I use my Remarkable 2 digital notebook for everything else.

Well, here's how I exempt what we're doing here is that if you're watching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">this on YouTube, what you are seeing is the video of a podcast, right? The podcast is the game here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">We put the video of the podcast on YouTube. Podcasting has a good incentive structure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's similar to books.

And that's how podcasts grow is people find what you're talking about to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">effective enough that they will then go on to tell someone else about it. So that's what I think saves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">us here if you're watching this on YouTube is that what we're trying to do is get more podcast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">listeners.

The stuff's got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8nKjLlkw2k&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to work.
