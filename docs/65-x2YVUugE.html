I skipped last week. I was too emotional to do the show, just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">so folks know. It was difficult to see what I saw on the internet and the reporting. I think I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">really moved. Because I thought a lot about the like, how lucky we are. And I thought about my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">children and seeing what I saw and being a parent. It's really different. I remember 9/11,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it was really shocking. I was really upset from 9/11 as well. But when I saw the events last week,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it immediately projected onto my kids and the care I try and take for my kids and thinking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the experience of other people in this situation. I was also, I'll be honest, really moved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and saddened because of the bombing of children in Gaza. And I was really saddened</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that there were innocent children suffering there as well. And the whole thing just felt so horrific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to me. I don't think about the justification or the morality of one side over another. I was just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">more moved. Because I felt really sad about the experience of a lot of families and a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">children caught in the middle, caught in this in this environment. So I was I was pretty hurt last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">week, I was in a really bad state, and I couldn't do the show. I think, you know, time has allowed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">me to kind of become a bit rational about things and try and understand where things are headed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's a really complicated, confusing situation. And it's really sad. I worry a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">about where things are headed, not just in the Middle East, but also domestically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">coming out of this conflict. So that's where I'm at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And thank you for sharing. I wasn't sure if you would share your absence last week. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's fair. I too have been thinking about my own children. And it's at 9/11. And it's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it's very dark. And so it's hard to talk about. But we're making progress here, I think. And today</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll talk about a lot of the issues, Chamath or Saxe, any opening thoughts before we get started,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">delving into what's actually happening. And then more importantly, I think, where this is heading,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and what the possible outcome or resolution could be if there is a resolution here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I think things are getting better, actually, I think, okay, from where,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">if you had to graph your expectations of how bad things could get, I think what most people would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">probably say is somewhere last week, there was a scepter of some potential World War Three-like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">contagion. And I think in general, it hasn't stopped some of the bloodshed, but the extent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to which we expected this thing to escalate, it actually hasn't happened. And so if you take a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">step back, and you kind of calmly and coldly look at the facts, I think that there are a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">people on all sides trying to maintain their composure in a moment where there's a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">brush fires. So I actually think that this has been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">much, much better than it could have been. And so I'm generally optimistic that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">going to find our way out of this. So, Saxe, any thoughts?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, to be honest, I can't be as optimistic as Chamath. It's true that World War Three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">hasn't started yet. But I think the situation is incredibly volatile still. Just the last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">couple of days, the headline story was an explosion or bombing of this hospital in Gaza.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Blame immediately fell on Israel. The claim in the New York Times was that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">they had dropped a bomb on it from a plane. Social media was aflame with that. I think in the last</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">day or so, the perspective seems to be changing. There's video now showing that it wasn't the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">hospital, but rather the parking lot next to the hospital that took the brunt of the damage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that it's far from clear that Israel did it. A lot of people are blaming Islamic Jihad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">In any event, it's very unclear. So I'm going to continue to do what I've done,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">which is suspend judgment until there can be some sort of proper investigation of what happened,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and we find out exactly who's really responsible. But it does seem that over the last day or so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">there's been now a backing off of the idea that Israel was definitely responsible for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Nonetheless, you saw immediately in the wake of that story coming out that there were protests</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and riots all over the Middle East. The Arab Street was absolutely ignited. And I think that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the Arab Street's not going to be convinced that Israel wasn't responsible for this.

This was my biggest concern last week. I think the thing I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">most anxious about was that the imagery that would come out of Gaza with the action from Israel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">would be the fodder for escalation worldwide, that there's this perception already with half a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">billion people, maybe 2 billion people, maybe more, that there's an oppressor and there's an oppressed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and the oppressed is suffering under the oppressor, and that there would be the creation of fodder to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">support that narrative. And I think that the hospital bombing, the kind of point I made to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">someone who reached out to me two days ago or yesterday about it, was I don't know if it matters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that we get the corrections from all these people that may have said something that turns out to not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">be true.

And it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">justifies the next step.

I think that a large number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of people feel like they're on the right side, if everyone thinks they're on the right side of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">something, everyone feels like they have the right moral stance that there is a regime on the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">side that has the wrong moral stance, I am good, you are evil. And therefore, anything I see,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is my confirmation bias for my belief.

What</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">are the factors where one side feels like they're getting something that forces them to say, I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">going to take the next step, I'm not going to justify the next step.

Let's, let's take that other side and just explore it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">for a second. So the question that I've been asking myself is, because I agree with you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it doesn't matter who was responsible for this bombing, because it's already been defined.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, but in a moral sense, it does just, you know, in a moral sense, it does. But I'm saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">practically in the theatre of war and the theatres near the war, it doesn't matter, because it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">about how is it framed. And to your point, people have already made up their minds. The pro Israel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">side have made up their mind and the pro Palestinian side has made up their mind. But the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">question that I asked myself is, okay, is that how much of an incremental escalation is it from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">what their status quo is? You know, one of the interesting things I learned from the Jared</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Kushner interview with Lex Friedman, it's like, a lot of this tension, you can trace back to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the Al Aqsa mosque, and all of the misinformation around that, right, he spends a section of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">podcast talking about how that's been framed and reframe the myths and disinformation to basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">get people fervently up in arms.

And in fact, you know, you can go get a visa to visit Al Aqsa mosque, and it's under the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">custodianship of the King of Jordan, as an example. So that is the fact. But those facts aren't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">necessarily shared on the ground. And that is where a lot of this original tension comes from.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So then I asked myself, Okay, well, if that's been lingering for decades,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">how much more incrementally bad does it get for this specific thing? And I think you see it in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">people's actions, which is, they try to use it to escalate. And my honest measurement of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">escalation is that outside of the actual theatre of war, most of these escalations died down pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">quickly. Now, if all of these embassies were overrun, and all of a sudden, you saw a Beirut</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">like situation, right, the US embassy in Beirut in the early 80s, I would agree with you that this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is getting really bad really quickly. But that's not what we saw. And I think what that speaks to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">more is how much hatred is actually in the heart of people versus not. And so I think that this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">was a moment for people to channel their anxiety and some of their aggression and some of their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">hatred towards America or Israel. But what it didn't was escalate. You didn't see these embassies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">get burned to the ground, you didn't see people getting dragged out. And so I'm not trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">justify that behaviour. I'm just trying to look at it in an absolute sense and answer the question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">is it escalating? Or is it not escalating? And my assessment right now is that it is not escalating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I saw on Sunday, something that I thought I would never see, which is Iran put out a press release</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">through the United Nations to Israel. You haven't seen that that's de escalatory. That's not an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">escalatory action from a country whose mission statement includes the destruction and demise of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a country. So I think when push comes to shove, there are a lot of people in positions of power</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">who understand the stakes here and are trying their best on both sides.

It typically comes from a place of deep hurt. I think the biggest question for me is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">how do you resolve the deep hurt that is being felt and has been felt by either side over a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">very long period of time?

Let's go to an example in our own lives. Let's just say that we have a friend or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, we had a girlfriend at some point, where there is a deep betrayal.

And then John Kerry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2221" target="_blank">00:37:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">who is Secretary of State under Obama, made a major effort to try and bring about a two state</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2226" target="_blank">00:37:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">solution. And frankly, it went nowhere. And a big part of the reason why is that Netanyahu said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2234" target="_blank">00:37:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that, "Listen, the only situation that's acceptable to Israel from a security standpoint</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2240" target="_blank">00:37:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is that we must control all security west of the Jordan River." So in other words,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2244" target="_blank">00:37:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we must control security in the West Bank. And his argument was that, "Look,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2249" target="_blank">00:37:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">adjacent land is very important.

He basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2259" target="_blank">00:37:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">said it could turn into 20 Gazas.

And when people challenged him</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=2264" target="_blank">00:37:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">on this, he said, "Listen, you don't live here.

So longitudinally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-x2YVUugE&t=4691" target="_blank">01:18:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">if you use it for a long time, I'm concerned about that.
