So I'm talking to this professor, right? And I'm like, "I haven't heard your area</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOEpe17nPhE&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of expertise." And I'm like, "Are we going to get to it? What's the deal?"

And he said, "I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOEpe17nPhE&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">used to do this. And then about two years ago, a student reported me to the school and I realized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOEpe17nPhE&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">my job was at risk.

I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOEpe17nPhE&t=8522" target="_blank">02:22:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I realized that, you know, there's an end and I realized that there are things I believe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOEpe17nPhE&t=8528" target="_blank">02:22:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and things that I believe that might not be so overtly popular, but that I truly think make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOEpe17nPhE&t=8534" target="_blank">02:22:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the world a better place.
