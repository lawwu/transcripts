So we'll be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">trying that out and we're going to be trying it out with the semantic router libraries.

So I'm going to go to the docs, we're going to go to encoders and we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">going to go to OpenAI Embed 3. Okay so I'm going to open this in Colab and we should come to here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So we introduce the or at least a dimension feature for the OpenAI encoder in 0.19 and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">OpenAI introduce it to our APIs in OpenAI 1.10. So you will need these versions to use all of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and that will come with this. Okay so we're just going to run this so 0.20 now actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and the first thing I'm going to do is just set some routes. These are more like well this is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it's more of a protective route it is essentially you know you don't want your AI agents or LMs to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">be talking about a certain thing so you're putting their protective guardrail that is exactly what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we're doing here. So I'm going to run that and these what you see these utterances here they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">just define a few examples of queries or messages or interactions that a user might provide which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you know things that we wouldn't want to answer and how this will work is it will not be restricted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to just these utterances but it will look for similar utterances as well. So we'll have that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of protective route and then we have another one let's say this one if we hit this route we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">want the agent to respond in a more conversational manner. So let's try with OpenAI's so the text</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">embedding three large model and I'm going to set the dimensions parameter to 256 and just see what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">happens all right I'm very curious. So yes we run that I will need an OpenAI API key for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">so to get that you go to platform.openai.com and if you're a missing colab it's going to come with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this little nice little text box so you can just enter your API key in there and it will work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So we are okay we're now going to define our our route layer so a route layer well it needs two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">things it needs an encoder which we just defined and it needs some routes which we defined here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">okay which is just our our list of routes. So yep we pass them into there we initialize our route</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">layer cool and then we can check the dimensionality of the vectors that have been created by this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">route layer by looking at this and yes indeed we can see that we have 256 dimensional vectors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty cool now let's see if it works with a few example questions okay very simple it's not like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">they're hard but nonetheless I think it's if it passes all which I think it might do that's pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">good okay so we have don't use politics and how's the weather today they both hit the correct</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">routes okay cool and then the other one so this one is not really either of those and you can see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that the route that it hits is none right it doesn't hit any route and yeah that's exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what we would want it to do so that is actually not too bad especially considering it is that 256</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">dimensional vector so very impressive and you know I haven't even optimized the model whatsoever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">here so we could probably get even better performance and I mean let's just go ahead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and do that let's see how we can optimize this further and just test a larger data set so I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">going to take this a little bit of code here I'm just going to copy this across and I'm just going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to go back to this semantic router library here I'm going to go to my docs and I'm going to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to threshold optimization so this is the notebook that shows us how to do this sort of optimization</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it has like a test data set in there as well so I'm going to run this all pretty quickly so I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">going to okay pip install but we actually don't need the local version because that's when you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">running like local models we don't need it here because we're using the openai api so I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to run that I'm going to define a few different routes so we again we do have that politics and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">chitchat routes but we also have two others mathematics and biology so let's add those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and then here is where things are going to change a little bit so I'm going to rather than using the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">open source hugging face

target="_blank">00:05:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">okay let's see how it will perform okay let's try</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">okay we initialize our route layer and there's going to be a few</span></div><div

gets okay so it gets the politics one it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.320</a></span> | <span

one here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">okay that's fine because we can actually optimize these right we can improve them so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.840</a></span>

few more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">examples here I'm going to add

target="_blank">00:07:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">optimize that to and we'll be able to see what the new models do define as being as being optimal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">okay so let's see we're going to fit this it's going to run over 500 iterations and you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll see what the performance is at the end so it looks like about 89 percent let's see what those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">new thresholds look like so you can see that far far lower which is interesting all right so it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">seems like the thresholds for the new model at least the 256 dimensions of the embed 3 large</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">model that threshold is is more like around what was this like close to three between like 2.5 to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">3 here for biology even lower which that's pretty interesting um it's a it's a lot different so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah we can we can run this as well so the accuracy I get here is 88.57 that's interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">so let's remember that number and let's try with ardor and just see see what the performance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">difference is like if any again it's just one test so maybe we don't you know we can't really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">decide based on this whether you know this means the model is you know bad or good I don't think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">so we're going to switch this across to ardor 002 the score threshold it doesn't really matter I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">think the default that we set by default for ardor is like 82 so I'm actually let's start on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">both in the same place you know let's assume we don't know anything about ardor either so I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">going to run that then so we are going to reinitialize our route layer and we'll just see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">how they this one does as well here so you see actually you know it's actually does it 75 again</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but results are you know it does different ones as you can see there so let's redefine all of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">let's see what the accuracy is here so 80 so it's starting off fairly strong in comparison</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">but let's see what we can what we can improve on okay actually so if you look at these uh they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">did not refresh maybe I should have uh maybe I should have refreshed something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah it's fine I don't think it's a big deal so let's uh let's just run this again and see what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">happens okay so yeah we can see the accuracy is it was increasing just then let's see what the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">updated thresholds are okay so they have moved around quite a bit I wonder if we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">let's try running it again we can do max it is uh is it I think it's this we can increase this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">just to see give it more of a chance to optimize okay but it seems to be getting stuck around that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">those thresholds anyway so yeah still the same so that's what we have for those and then the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">accuracy was so it was uh 87.14 so slightly worse although I have actually seen this go up to 92%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">before maybe it's because I added these slightly harder um utterances in there so clearly this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">actually does so this 256 dimensional third generation embedding model from OpenAI in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">case did outperform Arda which is pretty impressive I should put emphasis on the fact that this was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">just one test they I mean I yeah to to be sure I really do need to just be using the model over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">quite a long time with a lot of different things to kind of form a good opinion on this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">but it seemed to work pretty well here so that's I mean better than I would have expected given the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">tiny embedding sizes it's pretty cool so yeah that's it quick test I'm gonna leave it there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW931qHLV0M&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">so I hope this has been interesting and useful so thank you very much for
