what's called batch effects</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">meaning um the guy who run it you know spent like you know a little bit longer during the sequencing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">process or they used a different brand of reagent or like oh like just basically there's a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span

effects cause a lot of headaches um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.940</a></span> | <span class="t">and so that models that are able to sort of like account for batch effects that are able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.820</a></span> | <span class="t">um you know sort of extract the um the the gene expression information and then um and then figure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">out what for this exact cell what type of cell is it and that could be as coarse as is this a neuron or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">a muscle cell or that could be like given this like super specific like i know this is a neuron because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it's from a chunk of the brain but um i don't know what type of neuron so or maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">it's either one of so basically typing the cell um and this is like upstream of a ton of really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.900</a></span> | <span class="t">important biological um types of experiments and diagnoses and whatever so um so that basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that we've kind of identified this as a really core problem that has a lot of academic um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.340</a></span> | <span class="t">there's like tons of research that happened even a couple years ago that about this problem and how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to solve it and people got to the point where they're kind of happy with the solutions from an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">academic standpoint and then it really hasn't made its way all the way into practice and so this is and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.460</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like pretty tough to use these models not that like for you it probably wouldn't be tough but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">for a biologist it's kind of tough and so um so we're kind of focused on let's get let's take this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">up wrap it up into something that is really easy for people to use and so that's the point of this um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and and i'll give a little more detail on that okay so uh okay so one of the so like i said there's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">the the state of the art kind of has um is pretty either coarse grain or really specific to specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.940</a></span> | <span class="t">types of of cells so like you could this on the right hand side is like a hierarchy this is ontology</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.380</a></span> | <span class="t">there's like a database out there that you can use that is basically the data sets that we use are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.900</a></span> | <span class="t">normalized to this so like there's like if you so the problem that you have is if you make a look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">if your data is labeled as like you know lymphocytes or like innate and then you predict cd</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">16 positive like is that an incorrect prediction or how correct is it um is it's not a simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">classification problem um and then of course these can be wrong as well so but maybe if it's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a different kind of mature natural killer cell like how wrong is that really um if so um that should be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.940</a></span> | <span class="t">like seen as different than predicting it as a you know i don't know like a muscle cell or something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">um so um okay so cell typing right um okay you guys already know this um this is a model it's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">transformer based model it was trained it's so like without getting into too much detail about how it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">works um they you know like the data sets are not um so unlike gene genetic sequences so nucleotides like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=351"

cell i have a matrix of 50 000</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.100</a></span> | <span class="t">possible

target="_blank">00:07:13.260</a></span> | <span class="t">you did and you should have used a burt type model um so anyway what for what it is it is like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:08:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that we've built on top of it and where we're going with it so um so this gene pt is um is basically built</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">by taking a first of all for every gene in my 50 000 or so genes i turn i have a what's like a description</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">of that gene you start with this thing called the ncbi gene database and for every one of those i can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">just get a description this gene you know um you know this gene like i could even maybe zoom in no i</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">can't zoom in but like you know this gene is used for creating this kinds of proteins and like is this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">you know like whatever right it talks about what the scientific literature some small summary of what the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.100</a></span> | <span class="t">scientific literature says about this gene and then you take that you pump it into the um the this i didn't do this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.860</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">right and um so that's like a vector that is you know between one of you know 1024 and 3078 dimensions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">these are by the

target="_blank">00:10:16.900</a></span> | <span class="t">well um and so you take that embedding and then you look at for the cell what is the gene expression for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">um each one of those genes and then you multiply the embedding by that scalar like so if i have like um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in

saw like a hundred of this one so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">i'm

a database of there are two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">databases

like is it projecting from one place to another yeah so i think that what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">um so each gene has is represented by a direction right which is um so and this is in a high dimensional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">space so that 3078 dimensions so each gene um will be somewhat but not completely orthogonal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.980</a></span> | <span class="t">to the other one um there'll be like a general direction that i'm describing a gene right you'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=857" target="_blank">00:14:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">all of them will be in that direction but then like each one will be slightly different direction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.700</a></span> | <span class="t">and when you add them all up you're kind of getting the average and then normalized to one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.740</a></span> | <span class="t">you're kind of getting the average expression of all these different genes but the interesting thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">about that is is it because it's a text embedding then like let's say that the the information about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the embedding is like oh you know like experiments show that this is related to cancer right or something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">like that then there'll be like some bit of cancer direction in there too right and and uh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.900</a></span> | <span class="t">you know whatever like drug interactions etc so anything that's mentioned in there so that you're getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">like sort of a um in there is a sense in which the direction that the cell um is pointing will be like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=913" target="_blank">00:15:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of the aggregate of the scientific literature about all the genes or this particular cell does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.740</a></span> | <span class="t">that make sense i mean that's it's it's a little bit abstract by its nature but that's the way i think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=926" target="_blank">00:15:26.060</a></span> | <span class="t">about it that makes sense and so when you multiply it by your that the matrix that's kind of green and blue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.980</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah that's all that cell in sorry the gene information you had on the previous slide right like it was a big block</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.900</a></span> | <span class="t">yes exactly and then what you get in the output is for that specific cell all that specific gene</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">information but maybe it but for that cell yeah that's right exactly okay cool thank you yeah and and it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">actually turns out that this technique um in some some cases exceeds the performance of other like the scgpt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.100</a></span> | <span class="t">for example um so which is kind of incredible because it the scgpt uh transformer was trained on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">like actual genetic information whereas this is just like uh i'm gonna um so that like you know presumably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.620</a></span> | <span class="t">there's like a lot of relationship information between different genes and whatever whereas in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.900</a></span> | <span class="t">case we're just saying you know like oh we have these different um you know embeddings and we're just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">going to create a new embedding space and then and then like look at how well we do um so like and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1005" target="_blank">00:16:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">can see this umap over here and i have a few more i think umaps in this but um that you can or no it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">not in here it's in my notebooks which i want to make sure i get to um but you can see like okay like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">you are kind of your clustering is kind of capturing uh the the colors are the cell types so like um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.780</a></span> | <span class="t">the it is kind of capturing different cell types in different you know clusters in umap so that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.220</a></span> | <span class="t">promising um so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and then like since this is like a you know latent space uh event uh you have we have to have a graph of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.820</a></span> | <span class="t">performance and and um we can see that like i think that my my nutshell is that sometimes scg</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">in some of these data sets right scgpt does better in some data sets gmpt does better and there's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.380</a></span> | <span class="t">i'm not going to go into the difference between these two um but and then some uh like this is the exact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1067" target="_blank">00:17:47.980</a></span> | <span class="t">model so in this bones one um and then in some data sets the ensemble between the three of these does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">better and but you'll one thing that is important is that even when it's not the top the ensemble is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.060</a></span> | <span class="t">always pretty close to the top right so like so that and so that what this tells us is that the ensemble</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.540</a></span> | <span class="t">probably will do better and like maybe also interestingly sometimes you know because like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes scgbt does well sometimes um you know and does pretty significantly better than this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">in accuracy and precision recall f1 and then sometimes uh that you know gene pt does the best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1109" target="_blank">00:18:29.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and it does pretty significantly better than scgpt so they're capturing different information right and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.900</a></span> | <span class="t">and that so then ensemble is a great um a great approach because you know you can kind of hopefully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1123" target="_blank">00:18:43.100</a></span> | <span class="t">get close to the best of both worlds um so uh and and so yeah um okay so what so let's talk about i'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.100</a></span> | <span class="t">going to explain this plot a little bit then i'm going to dive into some notebooks because this is ai in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.180</a></span> | <span

just basically the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1157" target="_blank">00:19:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">descriptions from this ncbi gene database what we did was we added we got um we got uh gpt4 to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1167"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">the embedding right so we embedded the we we generated text on each gene um using a prompt we we did that over all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1185" target="_blank">00:19:45.900</a></span> | <span class="t">that over all 50 000 or whatever genes and then we took those and we embedded the full description</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1192" target="_blank">00:19:52.220</a></span> | <span class="t">so we came up with our own and with this is not super well labeled but for different um so we have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1199" target="_blank">00:19:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">this smaller test set uh you have like i think 20 donors of cells and then or so and then um just leaving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1211" target="_blank">00:20:11.340</a></span> | <span class="t">i picked three that i thought would be good for test sets and then what we did was just leave one out so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.940</a></span> | <span class="t">train on all the so all the donors except this one and then test on the last one and then do the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">for each donor right and you can see that like um the i think that there's two things that i think are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1230" target="_blank">00:20:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">noteworthy here is one is that um like the adding so this red one is the original embedding basically and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">then these guys are are improved embedding so it does actually seem to help to add more information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1246" target="_blank">00:20:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">about the cell and just like these are like progressively adding more information to the prompt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">and it does continue to get better right i mean not in this case maybe but in many cases um and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1261" target="_blank">00:21:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">other thing to note is like this is scgpt and this does pretty significantly better in some cases right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1268" target="_blank">00:21:08.380</a></span> | <span class="t">so which we knew in this case it doesn't um and then if you look at the weighted meaning um for by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">by the number of cells then actually it in in this case for this donor um we do this we're done just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1283" target="_blank">00:21:23.260</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty significantly better than um scgpt and even in the unweighted case it does as well a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">okay so that's that's like sort of uh so i want to just talk a little bit about how i did this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

render so for exploratory stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">um they're awesome they're amazing even for some pipeline stuff they're amazing because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.860</a></span> | <span class="t">you can see um sort of plotted output for your pipeline but they're also like total garbage for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.220</a></span> | <span class="t">rigorous software development because they basically have global state right and so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.460</a></span> | <span class="t">you're you're and you're

target="_blank">00:23:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">like production level stuff um i have not quite adapted it yet but i but i actually believe uh they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1410" target="_blank">00:23:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">produce some good software over there it's fast ai yeah yeah yeah mb

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">that's a cool way to develop but i don't personally use it yeah i mean i definitely have done uh um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1426" target="_blank">00:23:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">um i've done the fast ai course and um at least one of them and and uh like it but does he have like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1437" target="_blank">00:23:57.740</a></span> | <span class="t">specifically like here's how i do notebooks in production kind of thing yeah mb dev i think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1443" target="_blank">00:24:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">is like what they build on top of and if you look at like fast html it's built with yeah flash there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1450" target="_blank">00:24:10.300</a></span> | <span class="t">okay okay yeah

bunch of i think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1484" target="_blank">00:24:44.060</a></span> | <span class="t">even the doc strings get auto-generated like there's a bunch of cool primitives that they have in there to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1488" target="_blank">00:24:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">make it okay easy to go from notebook to like actual production stuff um but i haven't done enough of a</span></div><div class="c"><span

a lot with like material scientists and like chemists and um like uh mechanical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1519" target="_blank">00:25:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">engineers that would produce these like absolutely horrid iphone notebooks and so like can you push this to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">prod and be like oh no i uh one of the techniques that i developed is uh a just like have a python file on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1533" target="_blank">00:25:33.820</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1538" target="_blank">00:25:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">to the package and then reuse it in the notebook yeah and then the other one that i would often use is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1544" target="_blank">00:25:44.460</a></span> | <span class="t">replace the notebook with a script that's the same as the notebook right like something that that is not meant to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.940</a></span> | <span class="t">functions or a program that you reuse but add decorators to cache the expensive to compute data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.900</a></span> | <span class="t">so that the first time you run it it will it will do that and then you can always run the whole script</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1564" target="_blank">00:26:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">right so you don't so that you start with this the fresh python don't have like objects left over from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1570" target="_blank">00:26:10.540</a></span> | <span class="t">like 14 cells ago that you know are kind of gone um and they would develop on that so it looks like kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1577" target="_blank">00:26:17.820</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1583" target="_blank">00:26:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">but it is actually reproducible like those were two techniques that i used how did you um sorry where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1589" target="_blank">00:26:29.740</a></span> | <span class="t">does the decorator save the state like onto disk or yeah just like dot state as json or something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1596" target="_blank">00:26:36.300</a></span> | <span class="t">that i'm sure there's like more there's like more elaborate okay but it's saving it to persistent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">storage so that when you redo then so but the other thing so maybe you have a thought about this too</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1606" target="_blank">00:26:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">the other thing that i really like is the ability to have rich output in between cells right because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1612" target="_blank">00:26:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">then i can see like even if it's a like it work i often um we do we use databricks and some of the pipelines</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1620" target="_blank">00:27:00.300</a></span> | <span class="t">are written with um with notebooks and the nice thing about that is that you get you can be like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1627" target="_blank">00:27:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">okay here's the out here's the output of this intermediate step and here's a plot or a table or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1633" target="_blank">00:27:13.340</a></span> | <span class="t">something so that when i go back and review because of a failure or whatever i can just look at the plot</span></div><div class="c"><span

python thingy where it's a python</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1646" target="_blank">00:27:26.460</a></span> | <span class="t">file

target="_blank">00:27:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">eludes me right now which when you open it in vs code for example looks just like a notebook and i think</span></div><div class="c"><span

target="_blank">00:29:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and i have done that very much um so like you know so like this inference for that gene pt um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1748" target="_blank">00:29:08.060</a></span> | <span class="t">for those uh like the gene pt uh cell cells i've kind of codified into this like set the this set of libraries</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1759" target="_blank">00:29:19.340</a></span> | <span class="t">so here's like how do you do the inference this is embeddings this is all open source i'll i'll share</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">the link um and um but like so you can see that um you know there's different in like a bunch of utils</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1773" target="_blank">00:29:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">right so i call these from my notebooks um and as i develop them like and they become more like i'm like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1780" target="_blank">00:29:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">oh yeah this is a common thing or people would benefit from this and i add them there um so okay good so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1789" target="_blank">00:29:49.020</a></span> | <span class="t">uh let's see so where do we start the the um this so i did this i think this is the right notebook</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1797" target="_blank">00:29:57.340</a></span> | <span class="t">so i did this eda oh no this is not a very this is not it um i think this one is the one i want um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1804" target="_blank">00:30:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">so this is as i mentioned this is this tabulous sapiens data set this is like so cz is chan zuckerberg</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1812" target="_blank">00:30:12.060</a></span> | <span class="t">um jan zuckerberg institute you can um you know this is a link um i'll i think the easiest if anyone's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1819" target="_blank">00:30:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">interested in like following up on this more i'll just post a link to the this repo that i'm i'm uh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1826" target="_blank">00:30:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">presenting from and then you can just like find all this information um so so uh this um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1834" target="_blank">00:30:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">this is like an example of embedding sorry for the whiplash here um this might even be the plot that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1842" target="_blank">00:30:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">or a version of the plot that she did except that it's like active and you can see that again um this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1849" target="_blank">00:30:49.980</a></span> | <span class="t">like you have these different cell types and they're kind of sorta um embedded you know like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1856" target="_blank">00:30:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">you can kind of like get pretty good classes so um you can imagine that a classifier in high dimensional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1863" target="_blank">00:31:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">space is probably going to be able to do a pretty good job with this and that's indeed what we find so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1867" target="_blank">00:31:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">like um so this this code was the embedding and then there's this analysis one um so to be clear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1876" target="_blank">00:31:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">this was like after you have the embeddings then what do you do um and so you're like this is um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1882" target="_blank">00:31:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">this is scgbt and you can see like that like a couple of interesting things to note is that they're like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1889" target="_blank">00:31:29.100</a></span> | <span class="t">lots of different well isolated clusters whereas this one is more um maybe a little bit like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1896" target="_blank">00:31:36.700</a></span> | <span class="t">relationship the the discrimination between the classes is uh better in in general here but you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1905" target="_blank">00:31:45.340</a></span> | <span class="t">see that they have these like really horrible parts that are going to be completely impossible to just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1910" target="_blank">00:31:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">differentiate um and then uh this one is let's see what's the difference between well it doesn't really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1917" target="_blank">00:31:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">matter so um so i you know like we do these um oh this was the different versions of the the uh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1926" target="_blank">00:32:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">the um the embedding and you can see like they're all kind of the same this one gets a little better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1931" target="_blank">00:32:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">like i don't know visually it's hard to tell but like maybe this one and then this one like slightly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1938" target="_blank">00:32:18.460</a></span> | <span class="t">better probably um or actually this one yeah so like this one's a little noisier i would say than this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1946" target="_blank">00:32:26.060</a></span> | <span class="t">final one um so kind of you can kind of tell visually that it seems to be doing a little better but not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1952" target="_blank">00:32:32.380</a></span> | <span class="t">during not dramatically but better um so let's see and then like you know this i chose like this guy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1960" target="_blank">00:32:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">this guy and this guy so tsp1 2 and 14 and because they have good representation across all the cells and if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1969" target="_blank">00:32:49.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you kind of look you'll see that basically there's not a lot of missing cell types although they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1975" target="_blank">00:32:55.900</a></span> | <span class="t">like this cell type is only in 30 and so the classifier is probably going to not do well in 30</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1981" target="_blank">00:33:01.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and um maybe this type as well what is that whatever that uh that's this ecto epithelial self right so um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1991" target="_blank">00:33:11.260</a></span> | <span class="t">um so then i basically just run like in a loop i train and i trained uh let's see like if you look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=1999" target="_blank">00:33:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">at what i did it was sort of um you know leave one out and then i'm looking at uh let's see i'm looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2009" target="_blank">00:33:29.580</a></span> | <span class="t">at uh the three different algorithms which are random forest uh xg boost or light gbm actually and maybe one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2019" target="_blank">00:33:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">other um and then you know so like blah blah blah lots and lots of compute and then um and then like so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2028" target="_blank">00:33:48.860</a></span> | <span class="t">here's some tabular data and then eventually you get to this and the other plot that you get to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2036" target="_blank">00:33:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">is maybe um well okay so i did this i don't think the details you guys really care about a lot um but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2045" target="_blank">00:34:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">like so okay first of all we're you know this is how we ended up with this plot is we embedded those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2050" target="_blank">00:34:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff any any questions about that so this is partly about my workflow and stuff so if you have like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2058" target="_blank">00:34:18.700</a></span> | <span class="t">workflow questions or whatever um that's great too and and so okay um how we did this how did we do this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2068" target="_blank">00:34:28.140</a></span> | <span class="t">well um again not nothing no rocket science here but um if you look here uh you know basically um we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2079" target="_blank">00:34:39.020</a></span> | <span class="t">you know sort of like for every gene we submit batch requests to uh open ai so um the open ai embeddings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2089" target="_blank">00:34:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">are all old but they have a couple advantages one is that they're matryoshka embeddings so um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2095" target="_blank">00:34:55.580</a></span> | <span class="t">you guys are you guys familiar with matryoshka embeddings is it like a really good concept to know about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2103" target="_blank">00:35:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">um yeah but there was one question in the chat about how are you quantifying which one is better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2110" target="_blank">00:35:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">as in which metric so i think about that last graphic oh okay this one yeah so this is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2116" target="_blank">00:35:16.540</a></span> | <span class="t">f1 score so meaning um and this is actually a like an insightful question yeah go ahead uh i know i meant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2124" target="_blank">00:35:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">to ask about the like um when you were looking at the umap graphs you were saying that somehow the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2130" target="_blank">00:35:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">embeddings are better so this is um so you're quantifying it using that one score uh the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2135" target="_blank">00:35:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">models right yeah yeah and so in the f1 score is a little bit like it's not a great f1 score is only makes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2146" target="_blank">00:35:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">sense if you have all of the cell types uh in the same level in the hierarchy right so like way back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2154" target="_blank">00:35:54.860</a></span> | <span class="t">in the beginning of the presentation here i i you know like you have these this hierarchy if you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2163" target="_blank">00:36:03.020</a></span> | <span class="t">like some cell types here and some cell types here even if you're correct you might get it quote unquote</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2169" target="_blank">00:36:09.740</a></span> | <span class="t">wrong and so the f1 score doesn't work super well for for like sort of broad data sets but it works well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2176" target="_blank">00:36:16.140</a></span> | <span class="t">for uh the data set i'm using to test here because that tabular sapient data set all of the cell types</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2183" target="_blank">00:36:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">are at the same level in the hierarchy does that make sense yeah so for broad cell types what kind of metrics</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2189" target="_blank">00:36:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">you use uh sorry what what kind of um like when you are taking from different families what kind of metrics</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2197" target="_blank">00:36:37.020</a></span> | <span class="t">do you use other than f1 uh so f1 precision recall uh no i'm uh i meant you said f1 is good for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2205" target="_blank">00:36:45.980</a></span> | <span class="t">particular data set oh i see okay yeah let me i'm gonna get to that so let me let me answer that in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2212" target="_blank">00:36:52.220</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit that's a great question it's actually one of our most important questions um yeah</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2219" target="_blank">00:36:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">i i will answer that um okay so uh yes so let's see um yeah okay so and i don't i mean like there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2229" target="_blank">00:37:09.900</a></span> | <span class="t">no magic here most of this crowd probably knows how to do this if you don't i'll like go over it really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2234" target="_blank">00:37:14.940</a></span> | <span class="t">briefly but you basically um you know like to in order to embed things with open ai you basically you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2243" target="_blank">00:37:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">you know upload all your um text to open ai in batch usually and then like so you create these files</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2251" target="_blank">00:37:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you just create a batch job and it will you know for something like i think it's half the price</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2257" target="_blank">00:37:37.500</a></span> | <span class="t">um it will just happily turn away at it for up to a day depending on the size of the data set i think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2266" target="_blank">00:37:46.060</a></span> | <span class="t">you can see here for and interestingly for larger data sets the throughput is much higher but you can see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2272" target="_blank">00:37:52.460</a></span> | <span class="t">like um you know for 30 000 descriptions it took me what about an hour not even an hour half an hour or 40</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2282" target="_blank">00:38:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">minutes right so like um and it cost me like a dollar or something so like it's pretty amazingly cheap</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2289" target="_blank">00:38:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">um and and because their batch api is so well like it's designed for like massive projects so like it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2299" target="_blank">00:38:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">super robust like you just send it stuff and you get back stuff in a little while and it works well and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2305" target="_blank">00:38:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">like it's they've thought through all the failure conditions and how to restart and whatever so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2310" target="_blank">00:38:30.780</a></span> | <span class="t">like i i was like really pleasantly surprised at how well it works versus trying to manage all that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2318" target="_blank">00:38:38.220</a></span> | <span class="t">yourself and it's half the price um okay so uh yeah so that's that's like sort of how we generate it and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2327" target="_blank">00:38:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">then you know so we generate all these embeddings we try it on different um embedding types and i was kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2333" target="_blank">00:38:53.500</a></span> | <span class="t">of thinking that you know my hypothesis beforehand was that like

to tune hyperparameters and then we ended up with you know this classifier um you know that is stored in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=2996" target="_blank">00:49:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">stored in weights and biases and can um classify like our test set you know 100 000 cells in like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3003" target="_blank">00:50:03.900</a></span> | <span class="t">15 seconds so like super efficient at the end the inference is super efficient um but took a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3011" target="_blank">00:50:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">work to get there um and we ended up with uh so like and i can let me just share on weights and biases really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3019" target="_blank">00:50:19.020</a></span> | <span class="t">quick uh um in fact i think it's reference from here so let me just grab it here yeah here um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3030" target="_blank">00:50:30.940</a></span> | <span class="t">so if you guys are not aware of weights and biases you definitely should be using it um and uh so like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3037" target="_blank">00:50:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">the like maybe the final thing i'll mention uh is that like i ended up you know learning a lot about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3047" target="_blank">00:50:47.020</a></span> | <span class="t">training models uh in this process i don't have a ton of experience with neural networks and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3055" target="_blank">00:50:55.900</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting thing so you can look at these two different training runs one is the blue one and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3061" target="_blank">00:51:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">you know the um the orange one or yellow one and um and like the i won't talk so much about my metrics</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3070" target="_blank">00:51:10.700</a></span> | <span class="t">actually i want to talk also about the metric that we're developing um so i'll be really brief on this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3075" target="_blank">00:51:15.980</a></span> | <span class="t">but you can see that like this guy keeps having these loss spikes and never really getting to a point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3081" target="_blank">00:51:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">where it can converge before it has another loss spike whereas so let me let me make this larger</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3087" target="_blank">00:51:27.260</a></span> | <span class="t">so like you know it keeps getting down and then oh shit and then i have another loss spike and this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3091" target="_blank">00:51:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">is a periodic thing and what this corresponds to is different um different data sets and so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3098" target="_blank">00:51:38.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and the reason is that it's doing this because the distribution in the data sets is different and so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3104" target="_blank">00:51:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">that um it like whenever it gets to a new data set then it's like oh crap i'm mispredicting everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3111" target="_blank">00:51:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">and i have to restart from here and then it gets you know it like sort of like lowers um uh so it it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3119" target="_blank">00:51:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of like um gets down to a certain point and then it doesn't have enough um you know generalization</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3126" target="_blank">00:52:06.300</a></span> | <span class="t">so you can see it like generalizes a little bit and that these loss spikes are um a little bit not as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3132" target="_blank">00:52:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">bad and it gets a little bit lower but it doesn't really um smoothly improve the neural network so what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3139" target="_blank">00:52:19.500</a></span> | <span class="t">we did was this was using the 30 78 dimensional um uh um embeddings and i what we what we did was okay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3149" target="_blank">00:52:29.740</a></span> | <span class="t">just chop it off so everything can fit in memory so we can easily shuffle around the data set and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3155" target="_blank">00:52:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">just shuffle the entire data set and pick random sound sub samples for my batches and then suddenly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3162" target="_blank">00:52:42.060</a></span> | <span class="t">you're the loss um is much is dramatically better and um and you know these these are different measures</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3168" target="_blank">00:52:48.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that are not super important um but uh one so uh i'll take i'll stay on for a few minutes after and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3178" target="_blank">00:52:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">answer questions but i want to answer the question um about the metric so um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3185" target="_blank">00:53:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">we developed the the metric that we used let's see it's written out somewhere here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3191" target="_blank">00:53:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">uh yeah here the metric that we used um so you can if you look at the um the macro metrics so like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3201" target="_blank">00:53:21.580</a></span> | <span class="t">standard uh f1 score macro then they they're total garbage like the f1 score here is nine nine percent right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3211" target="_blank">00:53:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">uh uh and uh and and precision and recall are equally bad right so like um that and the reason is because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3219" target="_blank">00:53:39.820</a></span> | <span class="t">even if i'm correctly predicting but i'm in the wrong place in the hierarchy then i still am mispredicting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3226" target="_blank">00:53:46.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and so um like these you know so these are ranking metrics that are traditionally used in information retrieval uh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3234" target="_blank">00:53:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">uh um like this is like um that if is my is my uh correct answer in the top ten top five top two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3244" target="_blank">00:54:04.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and like these guys are just basically waiting like how far from the top are my uh is the correct answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3251" target="_blank">00:54:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and so um so those do better but i find it very unsatisfying because like one if you like in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3259" target="_blank">00:54:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">practice i'm not going to be like that doesn't help me right like i'm doing science i don't want to know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3264" target="_blank">00:54:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">like it's one of these five i want to know what's my best guess right and the other thing is that um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3271" target="_blank">00:54:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">you know it doesn't take into account this hierarchy very well uh where did that slide go um</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3278" target="_blank">00:54:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">it doesn't take this hierarchy into well so i i think that we're we're coming up on like a basically a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3287" target="_blank">00:54:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">hierarchical uh metric that we want to use that is basically how far in this hierarchy am i from uh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3295" target="_blank">00:54:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">the correct measurement so okay this is kind of biology related not so probably interested for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3303" target="_blank">00:55:03.340</a></span> | <span class="t">crowd but i do like i i thought that this was really fascinating because like this is very much a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3311" target="_blank">00:55:11.340</a></span> | <span class="t">process of discovery of the problem i'm learning about the problem as i learn about in the data as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3318" target="_blank">00:55:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">i learn about the specific model so i thought the process here was really exciting to me and i wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3325" target="_blank">00:55:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">to share with you guys um did i answer um the the woman who was asking the question yeah okay good all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3335" target="_blank">00:55:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">right and i i'm curious have you ever dealt with something like this and is that um it like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3340" target="_blank">00:55:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">like and if so like what did you do i haven't worked with bioinformatics data at all so okay but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3348" target="_blank">00:55:48.700</a></span> | <span class="t">what about like hierarchical data in general uh not really no i've worked with like uh easy related data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3354" target="_blank">00:55:54.780</a></span> | <span class="t">and all of those are i don't see any hierarchical kind of connections in that yeah i also need to ask</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3359" target="_blank">00:55:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">like how important do you think having domain knowledge is in uh inomics is to get into this field</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3365" target="_blank">00:56:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">like to do this by your measure i think that having an expert uh to ask questions and guide the decision</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3372" target="_blank">00:56:12.220</a></span> | <span class="t">making process is pretty critical i guess like like the intuition for what will work what's important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3379" target="_blank">00:56:19.260</a></span> | <span class="t">those things um you need an expert but i don't think you need to have a formal training i don't right so i</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsBryL4BoEM&t=3388" target="_blank">00:56:28.300</a></span> | <span class="t">have and i have a but i have a friend who is a very experienced bioinformatics who's done drug</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
