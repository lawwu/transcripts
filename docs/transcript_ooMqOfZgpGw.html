But there's a certain sort of black box quality to these companies because people aren't shorting them and aren't, you know, whispering to journalists about that, that there's something wrong here and there aren't publicly available financials for people to dig through and look, look and look at the numbers.</p><p>So now I don't think that's a coincidence. And I do think this gigantic moves into private assets has been probably not great for that, for the, for the, for the, for the, for the safety of the system. And you'd say, well, it's just institutional investors who can afford to lose money, who aren't losing money, but it's really not because institutional investors are just pentant fund money and is now mutual fund money.</p><p>So that distinction that the people who are investing in this stuff can afford to lose it is not really true. Um, so I don't, I don't like that rationalization. I think we're going to see how that plays out.</p></div></div></body></html>
