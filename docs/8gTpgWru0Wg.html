target="_blank">00:01:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And at AWS, we explain it like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">An agent is an autonomous system that can reason, plan, and take multiple steps to perform an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you have a task and you give it to an agent, the agent is able to take that task and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">"Here is the high-level

those steps have been taken, the actions have been taken on those steps,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">then it can evaluate the results and reason on what needs to happen next until it actually achieves</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.700</a></span> | <span class="t">This is an agentic system that we'll be discussing today.</span></div><div

colleague,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Souman, is going to talk about at this time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you so much, Duan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So taking one step further, what we have done, in fact, last week, last Friday,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">we have announced an open source SDK to build an agentic application called strands agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So what this agent does is it's a very simple SDK which needs three things: models, tools, and prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.220</a></span> | <span class="t">It cannot go any simpler than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't have any scaffolding that you don't have to guardrail your prompts, your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.460</a></span> | <span class="t">backstory, goals, etc. What we believe in is that in today's world, the LLMs are pretty strong and we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.540</a></span> | <span class="t">want to make use of the full strength of the model in the backend. So we are giving the better flexibility</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">for the model to reason on behalf of us. And that's why, if you look at this architecture,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.540</a></span> | <span class="t">it's very straightforward. You create a prompt or this is your question. You send it to the agent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.020</a></span> | <span class="t">which is the strands agent. And when you create an agent object, you will define the model and tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.940</a></span> | <span class="t">that we provide to you. You will see in the workshop when Banjo will go through a couple of the demos,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">you will see that the default model that we use is Claude 3.7, as of today. And the moment you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">strands installed and configured, you get a bunch of tools inbuilt. So you don't have to write heavy lifting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.220</a></span> | <span class="t">code to create a few of your basic needs. And the best part is not only for your testing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and deployment in the test environment, you can actually deploy on the cloud. So assume that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">have your workforce in EC2 or Lambda or ECS, you can just deploy your code with ease with the integrated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.260</a></span> | <span class="t">support for all these services. So to get started, just take a snap of this. This contains the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">launch blog, as well as the documentation, which is nothing but strands agent.com and the GitHub.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is an open source project, so feel free to give a star and just raise a PR. If you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">anything interesting that you built or if you have any specific requirement which is not there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.140</a></span> | <span class="t">feel free to contribute. It's just three days old and we got many PR and feedback from the community,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and we would love to work with all of you. All right. So the moment you're all waiting for,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">it's time to build. So we have pre-configured AWS accounts for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.340</a></span> | <span class="t">VS code is also configured so there's nothing you need to download. Everything is done in the browser.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you go to this URL, it's going to take you to our pop-up screen and you're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.780</a></span> | <span class="t">sign in. It's going to ask you for a one-time password. That's the best way to log in. And once</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.140</a></span> | <span class="t">you do that, you're going to be able to have access to the AWS account as well as the VS code server we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.060</a></span> | <span class="t">spun up. So we're going to take a few minutes to get set up. I always say this is the hardest part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.860</a></span> | <span class="t">of the workshop. So Tumon and Duan are going to be walking through. Ask any questions, raise your hand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'll also walk through it. But take some minutes to get started and let's start building.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you log in, you'll get to a screen like this. So I'll give a couple more minutes to get to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.780</a></span> | <span class="t">the screen and I'll walk through setting up bedrock so we can have access to the models and then to our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">VS code server. While people are waiting, I have a video to highlight what strands can do so I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">just show that in the meantime. So in this example, we actually have a strands agent that's actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">going to create a math video for this. So it's actually pretty cool. So let's see what happens here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's running an MCP server. It's going to start that. It's going to actually create an animation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">video for us. So it's going to create a maxim scene to draw the cubic function, 2x cubed. Yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">something hard that you might have to do in latex, scientific.

So we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">created a quadratic equation and we wanted to plot that within the range of minus 3 to 3.

So we'll push that code in the GitHub repo which we have shared earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's see what we have here. But this is just a testimony of how you can get started quickly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.020</a></span> | <span class="t">with the out-of-the-box tools and just a few lines of code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you. So the first thing to do is make sure you log into this AWS account. So you should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">not be using your own AWS account.

You should see this workstop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.060</a></span> | <span class="t">participant role. So you should not be using your own AWS account if you haven't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.340</a></span> | <span class="t">From here we're going to type bedrock, Amazon bedrock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we get to the Amazon bedrock console screen, we're going to want to enable the models so we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.060</a></span> | <span class="t">use them in our lab.

So we're just going to use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Claude V7, 3.5 Haiku, and 3.5 Sonnet.

But I don't think it's enabled in this account yet. So we've got to use the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">older models. So I'm going to press next. Once we request access, submit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, this code, all the code is open source. The workshop is open source,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and we can share the link so you can run this on yourself. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Module 1 is the one we're doing today. So we're going to show you how Strand Agent works and how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.460</a></span> | <span class="t">you can actually build agentic workflows with it. So the first thing you do is install it. So just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.780</a></span> | <span class="t">doing pip install strand agents and strand agent tools gets you what you need. And have some utility</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.300</a></span> | <span class="t">things, UV to download MCP servers. So I'm going to copy that command.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Paste.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.380</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Already installed. Great. So.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the cool thing with Claude Code, you actually can use it with Amazon Bedrock. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">if you have an AWS account, you have Bedrock, you can use Claude Code without using the Entropic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.340</a></span> | <span class="t">key signing in. Everything is just down to Bedrock. That's by using the export Claude Code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.060</a></span> | <span class="t">environment variable. So let me go ahead and do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.300</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So Claude gets started. Research preview. I'm going to press dark mode. Of course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.380</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Cool. So use recommended settings. Yes. Proceed. All right. Claude Code's ready to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So all I did was just export that command because it's already used in Bedrock. Everything that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.300</a></span> | <span class="t">ready to go is already in my environment. And you all can see this, right? This is a good screen. Yeah. Cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.700</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So the first exercise of the workshop was actually going to use a weather count. Every AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.700</a></span> | <span class="t">thing has to start weather first. So, you know, well, we added two tools to this one. The one that can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.940</a></span> | <span class="t">actually get the weather and actually count how many words are in the response just to show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">how easy it is to use different tools using strands. And we're actually going to use Claude Code to explain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">how this code works as well before I dive into it. So I'm going to open this up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">paste. Can you explain the structure of the strand agent weather word count file?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So it's going to be able to see what happens. Use the tokens. Let me open the file while it does that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll see what Claude says. Let me make this bigger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So demonstrate a simple agent, implementation the strand framework, an agent file,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">import necessary, word count tools, using Claude 3.5, actually the query. So let's walk through the code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.900</a></span> | <span class="t">in more detail. So we actually have a system prompt. And we're saying, you know, find the weather. And it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.940</a></span> | <span class="t">actually puts the API in the system prompt, hdpweather.gov. So there's no API key needed for this. So I can just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">query this and get the actual weather of what the place is and provide it in a human readable way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And the cool thing about this, strands has this HTTP request tool already built into the framework.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's going to be able to just make that request for you automatically. You just provide URL. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.300</a></span> | <span class="t">able to call that and get the actual data from that. And then you can use the cool thing about strands</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.460</a></span> | <span class="t">also is you can change the different models you can use. You can use LLM. You can use Ollama. You can use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Bedrock. Bedrock to default. So I just changed the Claude 3.5 just to be faster here. And then the cool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.740</a></span> | <span class="t">thing about strands is that's the system prompt, the big system prompt we put up there, which tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.860</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to use, the word count tool. Now what I really like about the tool decorator is I just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">define a function and just put the return value. There's no crazy thing, no adding. I just put this tool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.060</a></span> | <span class="t">decorator and it handles the rest. So as a developer building functions, I want to put all this extra stuff in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">there, make it as simple as possible to have a tool. So that's a really big plus to the strands framework.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And then from there I can just say, what's the weather like in Seattle? Let's change it. San Francisco.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.300</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so we can see how it's going here. First I've got the coordinates for San Francisco. You can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">see the HTTP request tool. Now it's going to use the HTTP request tool to find that weather. It gets the San</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.220</a></span> | <span class="t">San Francisco, 65, sunny, west, winds, few days, highlight. Now it uses the word count tool, 110</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.540</a></span> | <span class="t">words. So we've got about 44 lines of code. We're able to make that API request. We have the agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to have multiple tools done. So I'll pause here for a second just to have any other questions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">with strands because everybody's going through it. So strands is an open source SDK for building agents. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.220</a></span> | <span class="t">there are a lot of agentic frameworks, but strand is its own one. And you can see that you really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.460</a></span> | <span class="t">just need a system prompt, the tools, and a model, and it can execute that loop. So yeah, it is similar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">to other agentic frameworks, but I believe it's much easier to get started without the boilerplate and extra</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff that you've seen in other frameworks. All right. One more question and we'll move on to the next part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you. So I have a code-related question. So how are you passing the latitude, longitude,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.780</a></span> | <span class="t">and zip code inside the string? Right. So the cool thing is that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">letting the model decide how to do that. It uses this HTTP request thing and it understands what the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">latitude and longitude is of San Francisco and is able to pass that to this API endpoint or use API zip code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So it understands what the API is based on the system prompt and the model is figuring it out by itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're handing a lot of the infrastructure you might see in other agent frameworks to say you've got to do this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">you've got to do this. We're letting the model decide to do that because the model is the much more capable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">than they were two years ago when you saw the first type of agentic framework coming out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=900" target="_blank">00:15:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So the strands tools, like I see that you're importing two tools, which is like word count</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and HTTP request. So how many tools are there like? Yeah, yeah. So there's some built-in tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.140</a></span> | <span class="t">in the strand framework like HTTP request. But then I also just made my own tool, which is literally this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=918" target="_blank">00:15:18.700</a></span> | <span class="t">one line of code, return this length. So it's very easy to make your own custom tool. You just put this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.580</a></span> | <span class="t">tool decorator and that's it. So very streamlined. All right. So we're going to move on to the next exercise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So the next exercise is fun one, MCP servers. So you know, MCP is the hottest thing, you know. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.900</a></span> | <span class="t">what's really cool about Stranded has built-in MCC support and AWS, we actually have official AWS</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.900</a></span> | <span class="t">MCP servers. So I'm going to highlight the documentation lookup because AWS docs will be very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.940</a></span> | <span class="t">long, a lot of different things. So if I just have one endpoint that just grab that information and pass it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.020</a></span> | <span class="t">to the model, it's going to be able to understand how to build. And then an architecture diagram.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So making AWS diagrams. So there are two MCP, there's a whole bunch of them listed here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.540</a></span> | <span class="t">but I'm going to highlight these to an example. So let's go back. And we can also ask Claude</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Claude code to explain it as well. So I have to explain how the MCP diag one works. So let me open that up while it's waiting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Claude code is documenting. It's looking at what to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So while Claude code is going, I'll explain what's happening. That's just finished. Cool. All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Import the strand. Still going. All right. So the cool thing about MCP server is we can actually just pull it in with one line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We just the command UVX. This is the Python material for downloading things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to point it to the MCP server and it will download it locally. So I'm passing in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">the documentation MCP server and I'm passing in the diagram MCP server. And then, you know, Claude's even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">saying the same thing. Connect to the MCP diagram one. Configure using bedrock. Again, I can choose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.380</a></span> | <span class="t">different models on bedrock to pass in. And then I'm giving a system prompt. You're an expert</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">certified solutions architect. Your role is to help customers understand best practices, query</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.020</a></span> | <span class="t">documentation, generate diagrams, tell the customer the full path of the diagram when you create it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Just so we know where it is. And then again, we just say, pass in multiple MCP servers with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">diagram client, the docs client. We get all the tools based in those MCP servers. And then again, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">we have the tools, we have the model and the system prompt. All you need to have the stands agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we give it like, get the documentation for AWS Lambda, then create a diagram of a website</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.140</a></span> | <span class="t">that uses Lambda for a static website hosted on S3. So that's the task I give it. Let's see how it executes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1098" target="_blank">00:18:18.300</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So download the MCP servers. I already downloaded them already. And I was processing now. It breaks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">it down into steps. So first I'll search the AWS documentation. Then I'll read the document. Then I'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1117" target="_blank">00:18:37.980</a></span> | <span class="t">create a diagram illustrating architecture. So you can actually see its thought process. It makes an HTTP call to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1124" target="_blank">00:18:44.060</a></span> | <span class="t">get the search. It finds the Lambda welcome page to get the information. It queried the documentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Now it's going to draw the diagram. Let's see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It listed the icons. So what icons are available for it. Now it's actually generating the diagram. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">excellent. It failed there, but it understood that. And it explained, let me correct the cloud icon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Now generated it. Explained what's happening. And it made this new diagram saved here. So I should be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.460</a></span> | <span class="t">to open it up. Generated diagrams. And ta-da! It made a new diagram for me. So. Whoops.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. It's going to be different every time when you, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">based on how much context you give it. But yeah. I'm able to make that diagram. And just about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.980</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, 40 lines of code. I have two MCP servers. I put my system prompt. Picking a different model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm able to create that agentic workflow very quickly and very easily without any too much headache.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1185" target="_blank">00:19:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to pause here on any talks about MCP servers connecting me with strange agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1192" target="_blank">00:19:52.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there a pattern through API Gateway to host a MCP server with Lambda? Like the server side events.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1202" target="_blank">00:20:02.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there something that allows? Yeah. Yeah. Now because MCP supports the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1205" target="_blank">00:20:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">HTTP streaming server side event, you can have it in a Lambda function and do that. There are some,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.300</a></span> | <span class="t">I believe there are some open source code that demonstrates how to do that. One of my colleagues</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.060</a></span> | <span class="t">have done that. So yeah, it's totally possible to do that use case. Because right now I'm just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.980</a></span> | <span class="t">running the MCP server locally. But if you wanted to have it in the cloud, like a Lambda function,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1222" target="_blank">00:20:22.140</a></span> | <span class="t">totally possible use case. You'd have to change how this is set up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1228" target="_blank">00:20:28.220</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So the last exercise was we're actually going to create a new agent using cloud code to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1236" target="_blank">00:20:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">understand how it does without just looking at the code we have already and being able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1241" target="_blank">00:20:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">understand which CDK. I'm going to make a CDK agent. So CDK is a cloud development kit. So it's a way to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1248" target="_blank">00:20:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">create AWS infrastructure through code. Normally, if you want to create AWS infrastructure, you might use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1254" target="_blank">00:20:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">something like CloudFormation, which is a YAML-based way. But if it's a developer, CDK is more preferred</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1259" target="_blank">00:20:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">for that because you can integrate it to Python TypeScript code. So I'm going to show an example of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">how we can use cloud code to actually create a new strand agent for us. So I'm going to make this new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">file here. Oops. All right. So I created a brand new file. Nothing in it. And then I'm going to ask</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1285" target="_blank">00:21:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">cloud code, you know, update the CDK agent to create a strand agent connecting to an MCP server. Look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.820</a></span> | <span class="t">other files to understand how to do this. So I'm not giving you the documentation. I'm just going to say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1296" target="_blank">00:21:36.300</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, use the knowledge you have already to understand how to make it. So let me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1301" target="_blank">00:21:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">let me get into the repo and then clod</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1310" target="_blank">00:21:50.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and ask it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1323" target="_blank">00:22:03.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, so now cloud code, they're going to look through, see the plan of attack it does. So let's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1332" target="_blank">00:22:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">let's see what it's doing. All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1336" target="_blank">00:22:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll update the CDK agent to strand agent connected to MCP server. You know, it looks at the other one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1341" target="_blank">00:22:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no one line of code there. I read the other word count one. All right. It finds the MCP doc one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1348" target="_blank">00:22:28.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It examines it. Cross it off the list. All right. On to the next one. Create a stand agent. It put all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1353" target="_blank">00:22:33.340</a></span> | <span class="t">the code for that. It asks me, do I want to make this edit? So say yes, make the edit. It's adding the code to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Configure straight agent, quick MCP client, configure system prompt. It's done it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Perfect. So I'm going to close out of it. And what I like about cloud code actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.260</a></span> | <span class="t">tells us how much it costs when you end it. So the total cost, how long the API took, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.220</a></span> | <span class="t">how many code changes, how, which models it use. It used cloud 3.5 site haiku, use click full site</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.820</a></span> | <span class="t">sign it to understand what the best way is. So using cloud code of bedrock, that's an easy way to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1388" target="_blank">00:23:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">started in building applications like this. And it's now natively inside VS code, which is very exciting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1393" target="_blank">00:23:13.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's see if the code actually works. So I'm just going to run it. Let's see your expert AWS CDK expert.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.060</a></span> | <span class="t">How can I get a simple S3 bucket with CDK? Give us something simple. Let's see how it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.300</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So I was making a TypeScript example. I'll provide step-by-step guidance. It wrote the code for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's doing that security, Texas, add a CNN nag rule. So it really understands what CDK is. It's putting all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1434" target="_blank">00:23:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">this extra stuff there. And yeah, it even explained that. So cloud code is able to understand how strand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1441" target="_blank">00:24:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">agent works, create a new agent based on that, create a template on that. And it was very easy to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1445" target="_blank">00:24:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">understand. So by providing enough context, cloud code is able to understand what to do, create this agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1451" target="_blank">00:24:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's pretty good job. So I'm very impressed with using cloud code and bedrock powering. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.980</a></span> | <span class="t">also amazing. But that was kind of the workshop through and through to kind of show you what strands</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1460" target="_blank">00:24:20.540</a></span> | <span class="t">can do from a simple weather agent to connecting to MCP servers and then also making your own agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1466" target="_blank">00:24:26.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to pause here for any questions or if you want to see a demonstration of something cool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1470" target="_blank">00:24:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">happy to try it out and see what cloud can do. Sorry, I just have to ask like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1474" target="_blank">00:24:34.940</a></span> | <span class="t">what are some of the use cases for like using MCP? Like, I know I will be building agents that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1480" target="_blank">00:24:40.300</a></span> | <span class="t">probably connect to the outer world like through APIs and all. Like, maybe I don't know a lot about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1485" target="_blank">00:24:45.820</a></span> | <span class="t">MCP, but like what are some of the use cases you can like use MCPs for?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1489" target="_blank">00:24:49.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So a great question. What are the use cases for MCP? So by default,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1493" target="_blank">00:24:53.340</a></span> | <span class="t">the agent doesn't have enough information to connect to external API. So you saw in the example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1499" target="_blank">00:24:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">we created an AWS diagram. If I did that without an MCP server, the model would not know how to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1504" target="_blank">00:25:04.300</a></span> | <span class="t">the AWS diagram and won't know how to look up the AWS documentation. So providing extra context to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">model to do extra action. So when it comes to using large-angle model, context is really that empowers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1514" target="_blank">00:25:14.940</a></span> | <span class="t">what's going to go on. MCP provides a structured way to grab that information so it can take action,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1520" target="_blank">00:25:20.460</a></span> | <span class="t">read documentation, connect to external applications. So MCP is really kind of the USB-C, they call it, of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1527" target="_blank">00:25:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">connecting the LLM. So for me, it's a great way to just connect the external applications, get different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.380</a></span> | <span class="t">context for your model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1541" target="_blank">00:25:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'll show you some highlights of the AWS MCP servers just so you can get an example of what we have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1546" target="_blank">00:25:46.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are official lists of AWS MCP servers that do a bunch of different things. So I'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1556" target="_blank">00:25:56.220</a></span> | <span class="t">go through some examples. Show the documentation one. Bedrock knowledge base, if you have a bunch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1562" target="_blank">00:26:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">PDFs or documents you want to give to an LLM. Cost analysis, so you want to do AWS cost analysis,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1568" target="_blank">00:26:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">if you want to get another example, the MCP server could be useful for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1572" target="_blank">00:26:12.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Amazon Nova Canvas, if you want to draw images, Nova Canvas MVC server. The diagram one that we use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1579" target="_blank">00:26:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">today, you can also draw AWS architecture diagrams, cloud formation. So there's a bunch of different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1584" target="_blank">00:26:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">ones. And Terraform, if you use Terraform, front-end code, you want to specialize in React or using AWS</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1591" target="_blank">00:26:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Amplify, etc. So there's a whole source of MCP servers. So one big use case is I want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1598" target="_blank">00:26:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">my model to understand these things. You have a bunch of documentation, Postgres database,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1603" target="_blank">00:26:43.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Amazon Neptune server, like so. This is really the power of MCP. So there's so many integrations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1608" target="_blank">00:26:48.860</a></span> | <span class="t">you can have to give that model extra abilities to do. We do have AWS credits for you. So if you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1615" target="_blank">00:26:55.420</a></span> | <span class="t">to give us some feedback and surveys, I want you to fill this out. You'll get $25 of AWS credits to use,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1621" target="_blank">00:27:01.500</a></span> | <span class="t">so you can play around, try some things out. But thank you for coming and let's go build.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1626" target="_blank">00:27:06.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you very much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1627" target="_blank">00:27:07.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you very much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1628" target="_blank">00:27:08.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you very much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1629" target="_blank">00:27:09.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you very much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1630" target="_blank">00:27:10.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you very much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1631" target="_blank">00:27:11.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gTpgWru0Wg&t=1632" target="_blank">00:27:12.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div></div></body></html>
