And this does affect people. So income is very fickle. Like I like looking at like professional athletes, how do they end up broke and a broke because they had five years of really high income, and they spent money based on their income, not on their wealth, they didn't accumulate wealth to keep sustaining that spending.</p><p>And as a result, you end up one day end up bankrupt, because you don't have the flow after five to seven years that dries up. And then you have to live the rest of the life off that. So I think that's the difficulty with this stuff. Yeah, that's the argument.</p><p>Everyone mathematically lottery winners should always take the lump sum. But I imagine that if you win the lottery and you take the payments over however many years, you are probably statistically likely to end up better off people that win the lottery, not most, but some large percentage of them end up without money.</p></div></div></body></html>
