I guess I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">would order it next, maybe like venture capitalists. If you had a really big venture capital firm,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">where you can get a cut of the returns, now you can jump above that low seven figures and get that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">good, healthy mid seven figure type payouts. And then you have this big leap where you get to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">tech sector, like your friends, and then the tech sector, because you can have businesses that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">bought, that's where you start to get eight figure or low nine figure paydays. So now it's okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I've started a tech company and I netted 30 million in the sale.

And then the people who lord over it all is the hedge fund managers. Because now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">when you're a hedge fund manager, they laugh at everyone else because they can do eight or nine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">figure income every single year, because they're getting their carry cost of these really big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">hedge funds. And so then they look at the tech people and say, look, you're laughing at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Goldman guy who makes one five a year because you sold your company for 30 million.

Notice nowhere</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in that hierarchy that I say author podcasters, we don't land on that hierarchy, unfortunately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Professor podcasters don't land on that hierarchy.

I want to get longer cables for our video switcher so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">when we have guests, we can bring the video switcher so you can switch video for us. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">two. So boom arm for the computer monitor. That's number one. Longer cables for the video switcher.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">That's number two. Private jet. That's number three. Number four, I'm thinking we should have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">our own coffee maker because we buy a lot of coffee.

I think with that sweet workable money and grammarly money, we'll have that private jet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">right after we get those longer cables. That's depressing thinking about big money people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But I got to say, those people must all be incredibly stressed out. That's all stressed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">out. I think the sweet spot I still think is genre novelist. So you produce one thing a year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but you don't have to win book. It doesn't have to be literature because there's too much stress</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're a literary novelist because you live and die by the reviews. But no, you're writing like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">a Jack Reacher book. It doesn't have to be literature. You have your formula, one book a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">year. No one expects you to do anything else. Lee Child doesn't have a big social media presence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">He doesn't podcast.

You make a good amount of money. Like Lee Child,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">he bought the apartment above their apartment for writing.

That's the sweet spot. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">have a lot of money, but not a crazy amount of money. But it's the money to anxiety ratio. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTEn1ru3-Pc&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">think that's got to be the, if we put the other way, anxiety to the money ratio.
