Praise YAH. How blessed is the man who fears Yahweh, who greatly delights in his commandments. His seed will be mighty on the earth. The generation of the upright will be blessed. Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness stands forever.</p><p>Light arises in the darkness for the upright. He is gracious and compassionate and righteous. It is well with a man who is gracious and lends, who sustains his work with justice, for he will never be shaken. The righteous will be remembered forever. He will not fear an evil report.</p><p>His heart is set trusting in Yahweh. His heart is upheld. He will not fear until he looks in triumph on his adversaries. He is given freely to the needy. His righteousness stands forever. His horn will be raised in glory. The wicked will see it and be vexed. He will gnash his teeth and melt away.</p><p>The desire of the wicked will perish. (silence)</p></div></div></body></html>
