This is one of those moments in my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">life, and I wrote about leadership strategy and tactics where I recognized in a moment what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">detachment was and how helpful it was. I'm on an oil rig doing a training mission. My whole platoon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is in a skirmish line looking at a large area of the oil rig that we're supposed to be clearing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, this is not combat. This is in the 90s. There's nothing going on. We're just doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">training. And I'm standing in this skirmish line. And by the way, I'm the youngest and most junior</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">guy in my platoon. And I'm standing there looking down the sight of my weapon, and I'm waiting for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">someone to make a call and tell us what to do.

And we're waiting for a leader</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in my platoon to make a call to tell us what to do, tell me what to do. And finally, after like 30</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">seconds, which seems like an eternity, I can't take it anymore. And so I take a step like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">foot, a one-foot step, 12 inches. I take a step off the skirmish line. I look to my left. I look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to my right. And what I see is every other guy in my platoon is staring down their weapon, staring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">down the sight of their weapon, which means their field of view is tiny. It's like a 20-degree field</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of view. You're looking down the scope of your weapon or the sight of your weapon. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">how big their field of view is. I'm looking. I'm thinking, "Oh, there's my platoon commander. He's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">looking down the scope, the sight of his weapon. There's my platoon chief. He's looking down the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">sight of his weapon. There's my leading petty officer. He's looking down the sight of his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">weapon. There's my assistant platoon commander. He's looking down the..." So everyone in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">platoon is looking down the sight of their weapon, which means they all have a very narrow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">field of vision. Well, when I take a step back and look to my left and look to my right, guess</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">what kind of field of vision I got? I got a massive one. I can see the whole scene and I can see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">exactly what it is we need to do. And at that moment, look, as a new guy, you need to keep your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">mouth shut. You don't say anything. And I'm thinking, "Well, but no one else is saying anything."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So I muster up all the courage I can and I open my mouth and I say, "Hold left, clear right,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">which is a basic tactical call. This is not a patent level genius maneuver. It's just a normal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">call to make in a situation that we were in. I say, "Hold left, clear right." And I'm expecting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to get kind of slapped, told, "Shut up, new guy." But instead, everyone just repeats the call,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">"Hold left, clear right. Hold left, clear right." And we execute the maneuver and we finish the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">clearance of this oil rig and we'll get done. We get to the top of the oil rig, which means we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">cleared the whole thing. We're on the helo deck at the top and we go into a debrief. And now I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">expecting, okay, now I'm going to get told, "Hey, what were you doing? You need to keep your mouth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">shut." And instead, the platoon chief goes, "Hey, Jonko, good call on the cellar deck down there."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was kind of like, "Yeah, that's right." But then I thought to myself, "Hold on a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Why, if I'm the youngest, most junior guy in this platoon, why was I able to see what we needed to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">do and make that call? Why did that just happen?" And then I realized it was because I took a step</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">back, to use your term, I broadened my field of view, which allowed me to think more clearly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Because instead of being hyper-focused and narrowly focused, I broadened my range of vision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I took a breath before I made my call.

And I started doing it all the time. And I started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">doing it in land warfare. I started doing it in urban combat. I started doing it in all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">tactical training scenarios. These are just training. This is the nineties. I started doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">these training scenarios. And it always allowed me to see what we needed to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I started doing it like when I was having conversations with people and having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a conversation with my platoon chief. And I can see that he's starting to turn a little red in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the face. And we're about to argue about something. I said, "Oh, wait a second. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">taking a step back. Look, he's getting mad right now. And he's the platoon chief.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You better just deescalate this thing real quick." And I'd say, "Hey, you know what, chief? That</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">sounds good. Let me go take a look, re-look at the plan or whatever." And so I started to do this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of with my normal life was to not get wrapped up in my own emotions, not get wrapped up in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">gunfight that was happening right in front of my face, not to get wrapped up in the details of what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">was going on, but instead take a step back, detach, look around, and then you can make a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">much, much better decision. And it's not – it's exponential. You – if you're looking down the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sights of your weapon and you take a step back and you look around, it's exponential how much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">more you can see. Now, listen, if you are the only person in a gunfight, it's going to be harder for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you to do that because you've got to be focused on whatever you're shooting at. But when you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">16 guys or 20 guys, they're all looking in the same direction, it's very easy to be the guy that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">goes, "I'm going to take a step back," look around, make a call. So when you talk about the mechanics,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">when I teach this to people now, the mechanics of it, take a step back. Literally, you're – you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">know, you and I are at a meeting, there's a bunch of people, this starts to get heated argument,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I will literally push my chair back away from the table, change my perspective, open,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">widen my field of view. The other thing – the other thing like on the – in the SEAL teams,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't want to – you don't want to sound panicked on the radio for a couple of reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Number one, because when you panic on the radio, it's going to cause other people to panic. Number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">two, if you panic on the radio and you sound panicked, everyone's going to make fun of you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So you – you know, when you get back from the mission, everyone's going to go, "Yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you sounded like a baby out there." So what would I do before I would key up my radio?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Take a breath. And so here I'm manually slowing down my breath, I'm broadening my field of view.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're in a meeting or you're in a – you know, you're at the – at the supermarket parking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">lot and someone starts to yell at you, take a step back, take a breath, broaden your field of view,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">detach from those emotions that you're having, and make some space. And that's – that's how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I go through the mechanics of detachment. Now, I can tell you right now, I mean, when you – when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you do this all the time, which I kind of do this all the time, I don't – I don't really have to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">like, step back. But when you're starting to be able to try and do this, absolutely,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">make a – and I'll tell you, here's another, like, weird little nuanced thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Lift your chin up and put your hands down. Now, this is not in a combat situation, not in a fight,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">but here's the thing. When – when – when I get defensive, what am I going to do? I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">raise my hands up and put my chin down. That's like a fighting mode. So if you and I are having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a discussion and I'm starting to get heated and I'm starting to, like, oh, he's not listening to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">me, instead of me putting my chin down and – and putting my hands, like, up – up to where I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">put them in your face a little bit, no. I'm actually going to take a step back. I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">say, put my chin up. It changes my perspective a little bit more. It changes my visual perspective,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">just by changing the angle of my head. Take a step back. Put my hands down. I'm not being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in a defensive mode. I actually want to hear what you have to say. And if I start listening to what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to say and not talking, it's very hard to be detached when you're talking. It's another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">key component. You want to detach, shut your mouth. So I'm in meetings, you know, I'm in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">bunch of different companies. I'm running a – I have a bunch of – I own a bunch of different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">companies. I'm in a meeting in my companies. I'm not the one that's doing all the talking. In fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm doing mostly listening. When I'm in task unit bruiser, my task unit, I'm not sitting there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">giving the entire brief. No, I'm letting the platoon chief and the platoon commanders give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">those briefs. And that way I'm detached. I'm listening to what they have to say. I'm more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">capable of seeing what holes there are in their plans by not moving my mouth, not talking. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">listening. So those are some of the methodologies that I use and that I advise people to use in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4BH2wlBpog&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">order to effectively start down the pathway of being able to detach in various scenarios.</span></div></div></body></html>
