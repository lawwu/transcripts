And I know a lot of our listeners are just now having built up a lot of big balance of points and getting past the pandemic, thinking about where to go.</p><p>I'm curious if you have any suggestions from all the travels you've done of where people might wanna take a trip to or check out something that maybe is not the obvious place. (laughs) Oh man, my favorite place is Malaysia because I also grew up there in my middle school teenage years.</p><p>And that was like exciting. The food is the best, top three in the world. It's very inexpensive. I love Angkor Wat, Cambodia. It's so hot, it's like 95 degrees and humid, but the temples are unbelievable. I love Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia is a great, great region. Friendly people, people speak English.</p><p>Food is amazing. And the cost of living is low. So I love that. I went to Europe, probably 20 different countries in Europe. I love it as well. I love the lifestyle, the attitude of living not for work, but living for living sake. It's just that one of those things where after you see like five Gothic churches, they all start looking the same.</p><p>So I enjoyed Mallorca, Spain. Mallorca was amazing. The Spanish culture, you eat tapas at 10 p.m. You enjoy life, the water, the beaches. So, and then Amsterdam. Amsterdam is kind of like the San Francisco of Europe, where people are pretty chill. You know, weed is available everywhere and there's really diverse culture.</p><p>And I love Amsterdam as well. - I haven't been to Mallorca. Amsterdam's amazing. I want to come back to Malaysia because I think it's a country, having been there, I don't often hear a lot of other people go there that don't have some family there or some business reason to be there.</p><p>So if someone's thinking right now, listening to this saying, "Oh, Malaysia, I've never really thought about going there." What would you tell them to think about as a trip? Not, you don't need to plan a whole week or two itinerary, but what are a few highlights of something they should do other than my favorite is just eat all the roti canai you can find on the street.</p><p>That would be like my path. But what would you tell someone to think about as they plan a trip? - Well, Malaysia, it's a peninsula surrounded by water on three sides. And the beauty is the food is amazing, right? The mamak stalls, the roti canai, the milk fish, the chicken, fish, all that stuff.</p><p>The kangkuk belacan, gotta check that out. You can go to Kuala Lumpur for sure. See the palace, see the Batu Caves, go on these excursions, but go to the Pulau, which are the islands on the east and west, or go to Penang and see the turquoise water and go scuba diving 70 feet down and still see the water and have nobody around you.</p><p>My favorite trip was to this resort called the Tara's Resort. It's an island and there's an island on the east side. And we just had, it was kind of like, you know, the movie "The Beach." I think it was "The Beach" with Leonardo DiCaprio. It was kind of like that.</p><p>You would take a dinghy out, you'd go scuba diving, you'd come to this cove, there'd be some little sharks around, turquoise water. And it was just unbelievable. So it's the Tara's Resort. I would check that out. - Awesome. Yeah, I don't feel like I gave Malaysia its justice on our trip.</p><p>It was part of our eight month backpacking trip around the world, but it was awesome. The only thing, I don't know if this is still the case, but the one thing I remember very specifically, because it was a big problem, was that the ATMs in Malaysia would not accept any of my two or three American bank cards.</p><p>And so we showed up in Malaysia with probably $7 in cash and went to the ATM and it didn't work and we could not get cash. - So how'd you get the cash? - So I ended up going online and finding some local community in the tech community. So there was these events called Bar Camp, which are like unconferences that I'd gotten to know.</p><p>And I just went like Kuala Lumpur Bar Camp, emailed the list serve and was like, "Can anyone here meet me in Kuala Lumpur and I can PayPal you money and you can bring me cash?" - And someone did. - But my new plan is never go to a country without at least like maybe $100 of cash.</p><p>We literally probably had like $7, which could get you a lot farther in Malaysia than I imagined, but- - But not too far. - But not too far. - Wow, okay. - Well, yeah, so yeah, bring cash. And again, the Terrace Beach and Spa was on Redang Island. Redang Island, so.</p></div></div></body></html>
