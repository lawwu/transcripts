If you did perhaps an introductory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw44sG--n3Q&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">paragraph dealing with just sanctification in general, the term sanctification and the meaning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw44sG--n3Q&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of sanctification, that would be a good introduction.

The Bible uses the terms "sanctification" or "sanctified" in the past tense. We have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw44sG--n3Q&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">sanctified. And we'll look at some scriptures as we go along. So, there is a past aspect to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw44sG--n3Q&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">sanctification. Theologians refer to this as definitive or positional sanctification. This is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw44sG--n3Q&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the sanctification that we have already received. We have been sanctified. We have received</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw44sG--n3Q&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">sanctification. And so, that is referring to the decisive break between the believer and the power</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw44sG--n3Q&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of sin that has occurred at the moment of our conversion. So, there is a past aspect to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw44sG--n3Q&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">sanctification. But you'll see the second usage is the one we're familiar with. It's the present</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw44sG--n3Q&t=857" target="_blank">00:14:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">aspect of sanctification. This is our daily fight against sin. This is our daily progress in Christ</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw44sG--n3Q&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">likeness. Paul said, "I leave what lies behind. I press forward to what lies ahead.

I'm daily seeking to be more like Christ." There are the present aspects</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw44sG--n3Q&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of pursuing sanctification. So, the Bible not only describes sanctification in the past tense. We have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw44sG--n3Q&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">been sanctified. But the Bible refers to sanctification in the present tense, that we are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw44sG--n3Q&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to pursue sanctification in the Lord. And so, theologians refer to this as progressive sanctification,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw44sG--n3Q&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">or we might refer to this as practical sanctification. And then we have the third</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw44sG--n3Q&t=918" target="_blank">00:15:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">aspect, which is the future aspect of sanctification, which is also known as ultimate or perfective</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw44sG--n3Q&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">sanctification. So, the Bible says we have been sanctified. The Bible says we are to pursue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw44sG--n3Q&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">sanctification. And then the Bible says we will be sanctified. And so, there is a future aspect of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw44sG--n3Q&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">sanctification.

We live in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw44sG--n3Q&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">aspect of progressive sanctification. And just for a moment, I want to make a note as to why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw44sG--n3Q&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the present aspect of sanctification is so important.
