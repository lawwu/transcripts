There is like a moment right now for effective altruism where it is the thing. Some of it is political polarization, like the main parties are so stupid and offensive.</p><p>Those energies will go somewhere. Some of that in the 1970s, say, maybe went to libertarianism. Libertarianism has been out there for too long. It doesn't seem to address a lot of current problems like climate change or pandemics very well. So where should it go? Rationality community gets some of it.</p><p>That's related to EA, as I'm sure you know. Just like the tech startup community gets some of it. That's great. It seems to be working pretty well to me. Like, I'm not an EA person, but maybe they deserve a lot of it.</p></div></div></body></html>
