So I prepared some notebooks here. I was going to make slides,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.060</a></span> | <span class="t">but then I thought it would just be easier to walk through some of what this looks like in practice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a link here, and I can share it with you at the booth later if you have follow-up questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically, what I wanted to show you first is just what a general GraphRag architecture looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so basically, what we do is we have our agents, we have our tools, just like you normally would.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But then in the middle here, you see off to the side, we have this knowledge graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And this knowledge graph, you can both extract data from documents in unstructured places,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and also have standard ETLs for structured data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's a big question of why in the hell you would want this knowledge graph thing sticking in the middle there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And I could talk about accuracy and explainability, but I think what's really valuable to talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">about is kind of what this means going forward with agents and how it's valuable for agentic workflows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And as we think about some of what agents can do with reasoning and decomposing questions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of the retrieval that we're seeing is not so much just a straight shot vector search anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of what we're seeing is a question being broken down and being handed multiple queries, right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to go and pull the data that you need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And the great thing about having a knowledge graph is that you can express a very simple data model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.780</a></span> | <span class="t">to get started to your agent, which can help it do that decomposition, pull information accurately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.220</a></span> | <span class="t">and then as you sort of expand, you can keep adding more and more data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The example that I'm going to show you here inside of these notebooks is going to be for a employee graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically think about a knowledge assistant that's responsible for helping pull information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">around skills analysis, look for similarities or substitutions in a team,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and try to figure out who's collaborating, where skill gaps are, all that sort of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And the data that we're going to start with today is just going to be in resumes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I just have these PDFs, just like a folder of resumes, that are pretty standard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It just lists people's professional experience and descriptions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's for a company called, what did we have here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Cyberdyne systems, if anyone's familiar with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.260</a></span> | <span class="t">A little Terminator reference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So anyway, the first thing that I'm going to do to just show you what this looks like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is I'm going to load documents into the Neo4j graph database,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">but just sort of as like basically documents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Basically take every resume, put an embedding on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">What it looks like here, if I was to scroll here, is kind of like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically, I have these different nodes, but you'll see the nodes are basically just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">going to have some metadata, some text, which is the resume, and then an embedding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically what I'm going to do is I'm just going to create an agent inside of ADK,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">so Google's framework, and I'm going to start asking it some of those questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so basically what you're going to see here, and I don't have time, unfortunately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.180</a></span> | <span class="t">to walk through all of the code, but basically if you look at this agent that's been constructed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">right, I have my agent, I have some instructions to pull data, and then I give it one tool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.900</a></span> | <span class="t">which is a tool to go search documents, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'm going to ask it a question, how many Python developers do I have?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You can imagine, right, this is probably not going to work out very well if all I have is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.140</a></span> | <span class="t">just documents, because basically it's going to tell me I have five Python developers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's because I set K equal to five, right, when I went to go pull my documents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So obviously that's going to be wrong, and I'm telling you that that answer is wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So you could probably solve that with doing some entity extraction and putting more metadata</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">right on your node, so that's fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So then I'm going to ask, who is most similar to a particular person in terms of just their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.580</a></span> | <span class="t">skill set or what they've done?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, here, what you'll see, and I've told it in the bottom to kind of explain what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it's doing, if I go down to the display here, it'll tell me basically here that what it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">doing is it's just going to be using search terms to go pull information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So this might help you find similarity to a certain extent, like it knows, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Lucas is a full-stack AI engineer, and he does, you know, Python, JavaScript, and some machine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">learning stuff, I guess.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can search for that, and you can find some similar people, but the logic is still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit hard to control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just sort of, you know, plain semantic similarity search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And as I start to go down, I can ask questions like, summarize my technical talent and skills</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">distribution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.540</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not going to be able to answer that, right, because it needs to be able to do an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.900</a></span> | <span class="t">aggregation to answer a question like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I was to go up and look at the logic again, or I'll go down here, it could say I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">search, you know, employees' resumes using certain search terms and stuff, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's basically, if I go down and ask these questions, it's just going to be using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">search terms to find things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's not really good enough for our use case, because we want to do analytics,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we want to do aggregations, and we want to try to find relationships between people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, like in the last question, I basically asked it to find who's collaborating on lots</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.100</a></span> | <span class="t">of projects, and all it can do is search for collaborators, which is not really what I want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what I want is to find who's been collaborating with who on different projects, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And the resume data, you know, might have that, but it's all, you know, sunk inside of the text</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.700</a></span> | <span class="t">and stuff, so it can't really do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question is now, well, how do I think about basically explaining my data to my agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and then also making sure, right, that I have a data model that makes sense?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you think about it, you can do this at the data layer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.940</a></span> | <span class="t">You can think about how do I want to model my data just to start for some of these beginning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And here it's basically like I want to know what a person is, so I need that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I want some concept of a person knowing skills.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the only other thing that I really care about is what do people do, like what things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">do they do, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Very simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">That's just the data model that I want to express.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to do entity extraction of these documents to basically create this graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And really, it's going to be just slightly more complicated than that, because basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">what I need to do here is I actually need to create a graph where, right, I have, instead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.460</a></span> | <span class="t">of just doing things, I have publish, build, one, lead, manage, optimize, shift things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then those things are going to belong to different domains and work types, which is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">to allow me to kind of connect similar things together inside of the graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a little bit more complicated, but it's the same exact concept.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically, the entity extraction workflows we use are pretty self-explanatory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.620</a></span> | <span class="t">They use, if I was to go here, I use Pydantic classes to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have concept of enumerations on the types of accomplishments and domains that I want and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">work types as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I define my things, I define how someone does a thing through an accomplishment, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.340</a></span> | <span class="t">basically, I put that through another workflow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I use Langchain in this case to basically decompose those documents and spit out a bunch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">of JSON.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And inside of that JSON, for example, for this person, I have their skills, right, that I get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">in here, and I also have their accomplishments that I get inside of here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can go ahead and load that as well into my graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And now I have a much more expressive data model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I go back to here and scroll up and look at this guy, this is now kind of what my data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">model looks like, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I have my people, but now you see how they're connected by all of these different skills</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that they have, as well as the things that they're actually working on, and how those things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.020</a></span> | <span class="t">connect to higher level concepts, like whether it's building something for a system, or shipping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.020</a></span> | <span class="t">code, doing all those sorts of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And now, because I have that expressive data model, I'm able to start having a lot more precision</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">around the way that I get my questions basically answered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I do here after all this graph construction, which I already talked through, is I create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=513" target="_blank">00:08:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">this other agent, give it a similar set of instructions, I tell it a little bit about my data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">model in here, and then I'm actually going to be using this MCP server that allows it to read</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the schema, and also generate cipher statements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is an MCP tool that we just have, you know, out on GitHub that you can pull.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, when I ask how many developers I have, now I can actually do a query that's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to match on person knows skill, Python.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And because of that, I get an answer that's much closer to correct, which is 28 developers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.700</a></span> | <span class="t">That's very simple, that's just aggregation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But now I can ask a similarity question, right, like I did before, who is most similar to Lucas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Martinez and why?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is the same exact question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I went to go calculate that, I got an answer that it's Sarah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And it will explain the reasoning that it did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It searched for people who knew the same skill sets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes when I ask this, it will also search for people who have similar accomplishments as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And it will explain exactly like, hey, like I did an overlap calculation in the graph to figure out basically, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">given the number of skill sets they had and the number of overlap, this is the person that I think is the closest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So the benefit of doing this is that you have much more control and you can go in and filter exactly what skills people have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, if I knew someone actually didn't have a certain skill or did have a certain skill, I can audit that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I can adjust the graph to be able to make that work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then similarly, as we go down, to summarize a technical talent distribution, again, I can match on those skills</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and I can start to answer these questions and actually get numbers between how many people know different skills.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And it can also break down different accomplishments and other things of that nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So you just get much more refinement in the types of answers that you get for your questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I can also add additional tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So instead of just generating Cypher kind of on the fly with a language model, I can also,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'll show you what some of these look like in my bigger screen here, I can go ahead and move this up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is an example of finding people with similar skills here that I'm about to show you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically, right, I can do these very flexible queries in a graph database where I can say, hey, go from person ID to this other person ID.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And as I do that, basically what I'm saying in that top syntax there is go out some, you know, zero to three hops, basically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what that allows me to do is I can traverse over both the skills, over the common systems, over the common domains they work at, and all of their accomplishments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And if I wanted to add something else to that data model, maybe there's a collaboration link or another project link, that would all get picked up inside of that query.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a lot of flexibility and also higher performance in a graph database when you start wanting to do those types of complex traversals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And that allows me then, when I go to find similar people again, so if I was just to scroll down to my question where I define my agent again, I give it more tools,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and then I can actually look at who is most similar to Lucas Martinez and why, and it will start doing these queries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So what you see it get back is, like, all of the results of what I was just showing you earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And what that will help with, if I scroll down to the response, is now what will help me get all of these specific numbers around the skills and then also the domains now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">between the different AI and analytics and data engineering and things that they were working on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's more explainability with the way that these questions are being answered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.020</a></span> | <span class="t">The last part that I wanted to show you, and I only have a few minutes left, so I'm going to go very quick, is what happens now when you want to add more data to your graph, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically, say that we had this resume data, but now we have this internal data that comes from a human resource intelligence system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And this tells me different projects that people are working on together and collaborating on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have basically the same people that came from resumes earlier, but now I can see different projects that they were working on together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And the great thing about graph is that it allows you to add these things very flexibly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I go back to my notebook here, when you expand a data model with something like, if you're in sort of RDBMS or tables,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the assumptions that I made when I was ingesting the resumes initially was it was one person, an accomplishment only had one person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">It was sort of this one-to-one relationship, or really it was one-to-many, but an accomplishment only had one person because it was just listed on their resume.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But now that I am doing this thing with this internal system, I can actually see people who are co-collaborating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And what that would mean in a tabular environment is I would have to create another join table, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'd have to do some sort of data model refactor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But the great thing about graph is that I don't have to do that at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I can just sort of create new relationships.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is very useful when you're going from one-to-many, to many-to-many, or when you're introducing completely new node and relationship types.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very easy to do that, which is super important as we move very, very fast, right, with our agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And we want to ingest new data quickly and kind of build out our systems and pivot and all that sort of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And once I have that information, right, I can start asking questions about who's collaborating with each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create, this is sort of what the tool creation looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.380</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a lot of the same tools that I had before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But the tool that I can create here to find collaborators will basically do this match.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.220</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all the way down here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It will do this match to find people who are working on the same thing within a certain set of domains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's kind of what the graph looks like that I get returned.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I now want to, since I've added that tool, basically what it means is that when I ask a question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.660</a></span> | <span class="t">like which individuals have collaborated with each other to, and this says, deliver the most AI things, right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.460</a></span> | <span class="t">it can go ahead and leverage that tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it can now return an answer that's much more, you know, exact and based on my data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So now I know that Sarah and Amanda have collaborated on very specific projects,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">and as well as I have other collaborators here with supply chain and such.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was my short presentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I hope it was helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

talk more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's it for me today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you,
