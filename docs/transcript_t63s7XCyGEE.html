Yeah, so first we have flight search tools. So you know you want to go from this airport to that airport, you know your dates of travel.</p><p>Press go and tell me what flights are available, how much they cost with points. Another category is flight discovery, and that's where the tools are broader. Then the next two categories are around hotel searches. So you have hotel points and you want to use them. You know you're going to be going to Paris during July 6th to the 20th and show me what hotels are available and how much do they cost with points.</p><p>The other category I'm calling impossible to find hotel awards. So this is where you have your heart set on a particular hotel, but it's a popular hotel. It's rarely available with points. Tools like this will help you find when it is available.</p></div></div></body></html>
