And I think we were in training camp in San Diego, and I'll never forget this. I think I came down and hit a heasy pull-up, but I think you were on the side, waiting for me to pass him, and he was like, "I hit the shot," but you were like, "Mike, I can do that, too." You passed him, I was like, "Okay, he's cold," and this is your rookie season, and you just were so confident, bro, so it was a joy to watch you play, and be your teammate.</p></div></div></body></html>
