Flying direct with Fiji Airways. Hey radicals, this is Josh Rascheitz. Just a quick note of announcement to say that Radical Personal Finance will be on spring break for the next few weeks. I want to let you know that I do have a couple of interviews pre-recorded and I'm going to release one or two shows where I've been featured on somebody else's podcast and in the interim until we get back to the regularly scheduled programming, I encourage you to check out the archives.</p><p>The full archives are available on the Radical Personal Finance app, all the episodes going back to episode one. If you haven't listened to the past archives, I'd encourage you to go back and look through the titles and see if there might be some shows that you'll find useful. The philosophy here at Radical Personal Finance is to try to hit most major topics only once.</p><p>Even though you might have to deal with a few more ums and ahs and a little bit less of a polished delivery in the earlier shows, I think you'll find a lot of good information there. I know hundreds of people have emailed me and told me they've found a great deal of value in the archives of the show.</p><p>So when I get back from spring break, we will resume our regularly scheduled programming, look for some sporadic episodes being released over the next few weeks and in the meantime, enjoy the archives. Again, all 320-ish episodes, I had to look to see which one this is, all about 320 episodes available in the archives on the free Radical Personal Finance app in the App Store.</p><p>The LA Kings Holiday Pack is back! The perfect gift for the hockey fan in your life, a three-game pack starts at just $159 and includes a holiday blanket. Buy today and you'll receive an additional game for free.
