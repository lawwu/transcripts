These are people that are not just good at what they do, but are exceptional at what they do.</p><p>"Among the professions they looked at in this study," 'cause they didn't look at all professions, "those in the military "and those who are professional athletes "or had jobs in the social or natural sciences, "there was a lower percentage of those "that had depression or mania. "In some cases, like those who are professional athletes, "there was no incidents of mania." It is really striking to see how the creative occupations, poetry, fiction, art, nonfiction writing, music composition, theater, much higher incidents.</p><p>We'd be wrong to say that certain aspects of manic episodes don't lend themselves well to creativity. In no way, shape, or form do I believe that being depressed is a good thing or that being manic is a good thing.</p></div></div></body></html>
