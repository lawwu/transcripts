get so cluttered?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=8" target="_blank">00:00:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If you open your Bible at a random page, you'll find verse and chapter numbers have been added, of course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=14" target="_blank">00:00:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And often the text has been scrunched into a two-column layout, like no other book we read,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=20" target="_blank">00:00:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and often with a bunch of tiny cross-references printed down the middle of those two

added, and so too have been book introductions and often study notes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=30" target="_blank">00:00:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">colorful images, call-out boxes on the pages, and a concordance and maps and other things in the back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Our Bibles are loaded with extra clutter.</span></div><div

and markings is a long one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and Bible readers are beginning to ask what the clutter is doing to the psychology of our Bible reading.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And should we be preserving space in our lives to read the Bible without all of these markings?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I connected with Glenn Powell, the executive director of the Biblica Institute for Bible Reading,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.300</a></span> | <span class="t">a think tank dedicated to studying trends in Bible reading and design.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Glenn is also the author of the new book, "Saving the Bible from Ourselves, Learning to Read and Live the Bible Well."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We recently sat down and recorded this weekend conversation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and to start I asked him about the history of verse and chapter numbers that we see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Who added those to our Bible?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure, it's actually a little piece of a bigger story with the Bible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's actually pretty hard to find Bible manuscripts that are perfectly clean with no markings on them at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's often said that the very first manuscripts were just a series of letters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">with not even spaces between words and punctuation, that sort of thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">which is basically true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">However, very early on, people started saying, "Look, we need to have these things with helps."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The early manuscripts were read out loud, so oftentimes the very first things that appear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">are breathing marks, little spaces between words, page numbers, those sorts of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think what happened over time is we just started inserting more things into the text,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">all with the interest of providing help, of course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">There were practical reasons for these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But by the time you get to the end of the history of the Bible in our time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">these helps, these additions, have pretty much overwhelmed the text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, chapter numbers, surprisingly to many people when I speak about this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">came rather late in the game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">The chapter system that we know in our Bibles today came from Stephen Langdon,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">who was an English church leader in the early 1200s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So to think about the fact that the Bible existed without these chapter numbers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">for over a thousand years is startling to many people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think just the realization, I think one big light that comes on for people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is to know that the Bible itself has a history as a book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and that it developed over time in its format,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and that the Bible doesn't have to be what we see today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And in fact, it always hasn't been what we see today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're interested to know that verses and chapters have separate histories, really.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The chapter numbers were inserted--Langdon was actually working on Bible commentaries,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and so it's very helpful to find the Bible in sections that are easier to find specific pieces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So the chapter numbers came in for that reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, many times, some of the various chapter number systems--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">there were more than one at various points in the Bible's history--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">were included so that people could find passages for public reading of Scripture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's these practical uses that really developed the form,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the changing form that we see in the Bible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Verses came 300 years later in the 1500s,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's interesting, the gentleman who started the verse number system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the man that we know, Robert Estienne, a French printer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">was actually working on a Bible concordance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So verses, of course, are more precise than chapters,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and so he needed something closer to smaller pieces of the Bible than chapter numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So he inserted verse numbers into a Greek New Testament</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and added numbers to the Hebrew breathing marks that already existed in the Old Testament,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and voila, you get the modern chapter and verse Bible for the very first time in the 16th century,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">which is, again, surprisingly late in the Bible's history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, it's fascinating, I think, to realize that both innovations were added to the text</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">in the search of better reference help, commentaries and concordances,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's what led to the introduction of chapters and verses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The history of oral Bible reading is a rich and incredible story of its own,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but it'll have to wait for another podcast episode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to talk about the implications of this reference style in a moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">When we open our Bibles, we also see a two-column style.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Where did that originate, and how does that style influence our engagement with the Bible?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, when you think about the scroll, right, opening horizontally, columns had to exist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Those lines can't go on forever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, the scrolls certainly had columns.</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="t">and when we back-design or back-format the Bible to fit our desire for something like a concordance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">then we're changing what the Bible is in its regular presentation.</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:08:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we changed the Bible into a chapter and verse Bible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lChRd3u1QkE&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">plus added all these other modern additives, cross-references, section headings,
