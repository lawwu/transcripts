This video is of Mark Zuckerberg and I, Lex Freedman, training jujitsu. Martial art with the goal of attaining positional dominance of your opponent, and then to submit them by breaking their arm or leg or choking them unconscious. But stopping right before that, as your opponent taps twice to designate that they give up.</p><p>I'm a black belt in jujitsu and I've been doing it for over 15 years, and also judo and wrestling for 10 more. Mark has been training jujitsu for just over a year, and has taken this journey on with humility and with a seriousness that to me is truly inspiring.</p><p>This was recorded shortly after our recent podcast conversation. And given the recent back and forth between Elon and Zuck on social media, I should mention that I'm a longtime friend of Elon and a new friend of Zuck. And I'm excited to see them take on the journey of being martial artists in their own way, and I look forward to training with each of them.</p><p>They both run large, successful, impactful companies, and so they're super busy. But I do believe there's tremendous value in them practicing martial arts, as it will make them better leaders, better human beings, and students of human nature. First and foremost, at least to me, jujitsu is humbling, and humility is a powerful tool for innovation and leadership.</p><p>Let me quote here as one must, the great Miyamoto Musashi, a Japanese swordsman and warrior philosopher from the 17th century. Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world. That said, this is a martial art. So he also did say that the way of the warrior is the resolute acceptance of death.</p><p>In this video, you see Mark and I doing live technical training and some practice of techniques under the guidance of the legendary jiu jitsu and judo instructor Dave Comorillo. And now, dear friends, here's Mark Zuckerberg and I training some jiu jitsu. >> You can grapple too. >>  >> You want to do it with both hands?</p><p>>> I just don't want to do it with the hands. >> Okay, yeah, no worries. >> Nice, Mark. >> Hey, what? >> >> You know what? You guys go. Sorry. >> You want to get in here with me? >> Okay. >> What? You're back, right? >> Nice. >> Nice.</p><p>>> You're gonna have to stand up to make it shake off. Nice. >> Hey, you guys need help? >> Yeah. >> Just a little. >> Yeah. >> If that doesn't work, sit up. Sit up. >> And if not, there's your triangle. Triangle, yep. Nice. Up, up, up, up. Close your hand on your arm.</p><p>Yes. There you go, Max. Very nice. Sit back, sit back. >> Okay. >> You don't have to. There you go. >> Hold your right. >> You could lock your leg. >> Yeah. >> Notice, and that's why I'm doing it here. >> That's what we're talking about. Let's get the posture to shake them off.</p><p>>> Spin. >> Yep, yep, yep, exactly. >> All right, we're gonna finish that. >> Yeah. >> We're gonna finish that. >> Yeah. >> You know it's better on your feet now. >> I'm not getting that low, guys. >> Mark, you look like a jitsu guy. >> I'm not. >> Awesome.</p><p>>> You look like a jitsu guy. >> I'm not. >> Awesome. >> You look like a jitsu guy. >> I'm not. >> Awesome. >> You look like a jitsu guy. >> I'm not. >> Awesome. >> You look like a jitsu guy. >> I'm not. >> Awesome. >> Exactly. >> Thank you.</p><p>>> That was awesome. All right, time for one more. Let's put Mark and Lex together. >> We had such a great run on this one. >> All right. >> Start with four positions. >> Take that. >> Come on, bud. >> You need to use pins. Get Nick down and get them.</p><p>>> Yeah, that was great. >> You look like a jitsu guy. >> Nick, double up on that. Get on with the double. >> I'm not. >> You look like a jitsu guy. >> I'm not. >> You look like a jitsu guy. >> I'm not. >> You look like a jitsu guy.</p><p>>> Nick, double up on that. Get on with the double. Nice, nice. >> Nice. >> I don't think you can go for the double. >> You got to lean back against the wall. His legs were pinned together. You've got to double and pull up. >> When he has that guillotine, turn away from the elbow.</p><p>Like, turn towards the elbow. You know what I mean? >> Yeah. >> Don't go in here. >> I'm not. >> You look like a jitsu guy. >> I'm not. >> You look like a jitsu guy. >> I'm not. >> You look like a jitsu guy. >> I'm not. >> You look like a jitsu guy.</p><p>>> I'm not. >> You look like a jitsu guy. >> I'm not. >> You need to sweep and get a pin.
