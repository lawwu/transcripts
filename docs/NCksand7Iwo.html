target="_blank">00:01:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the world to clawed code and i wouldn't be surprised if if virtually everybody in this call had kind of had the</span></div><div

i found is that um and hope i don't know if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.540</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a pg-13 filter on this but i'm basically a cuckold to clawed all i do is sit there and watch it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.420</a></span> | <span class="t">do what i used to love doing and um i'm just helpless i sit there it takes you know one to two minutes to uh</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to complete and i often find myself getting you know on twitter and it's actually quite demoralizing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to be honest as a workflow to just like constantly go back and forth between twitter and claw code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">so i think there are lots of things that we can be doing as developers during those one to two minutes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">um that we're waiting and essentially what i've come up with is uh vibe kanban and it is it's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.080</a></span> | <span class="t">simple concept it's basically a kanban board and you can add projects so projects are um git repos</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and you can queue up different tasks in the kanban just like this so what we're editing at the moment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is actually vibe kanban itself so what i will do is you know just make a very simple dummy ticket change</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the settings icon to uh you know some fruit or something and we can go ahead and hit create start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you have the option of so what what what just happened when i hit start is the uh in the background</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a git work tree is being created specifically for this task you can see the um a setup script is now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">running and so these are defined on a project level it's kind of like what you would do if you were setting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">up your github ci or you had some scripts in you know in your docker file or something like that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.740</a></span> | <span class="t">um i've just got pmpmi and cargo build uh and then what's going to happen in a minute although it takes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a minute so i'll just skip maybe to one of these that uh has already run is that an executor will start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.900</a></span> | <span class="t">and this can be either clawed code amp or gemini i actually find myself mainly using amp these days i don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">know uh how familiar everybody is with that but um it's from its source graph's new coding agent which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is pretty cool gemini i haven't been able to try yet because i just get 429'd every single time i try it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">but i've heard you know decent things from people that have managed to get through and essentially once a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.780</a></span> | <span class="t">task is complete uh what do you want to do well you want to review the changes so you get a um uh a kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">of mini github review screen if you need to rebase it you get a rebase button if the and that'll just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.700</a></span> | <span class="t">you know one click rebase it i'm going to add claw code for fixing kind of messy rebases as well soon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.600</a></span> | <span class="t">uh and then when you're ready to merge you can go ahead and just hit the hit the merge button so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">basically just takes everything you were doing in five or six tools uh or five or six different terminal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">windows and just brings it into one and the beauty of it is it just gives you that visibility so that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">while this is running i can be thinking like okay well i can test the last thing that came in or i could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">be planning the next thing that i'm going to do and i'm not just sitting there kind of helplessly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">watching claude um trying to think if there are some other nice little things that are worth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">mentioning okay so dev servers that was another thing that i found myself doing quite a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">um you can hit start and that'll run a script that's configured in your project in this case it's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">npm run dev and we can see the logs uh address already in use that means i'm running a dev server</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">probably just somewhere locally off vibe kanban at the moment if it was on vibe kanban</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it would have automatically killed the the other one and that is basically it i'm very interested in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">hearing you know

lap</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">laptop like an m3 you know mac but

these coding tools so they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.540</a></span> | <span class="t">actually

target="_blank">00:31:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">okay great all right i'm gonna do this in the background let's go to the next question are you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

show show show us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=1886" target="_blank">00:31:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">show us oh okay but does it have it looks like quite a big installation though i think if you've already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=1894" target="_blank">00:31:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">got this installed how do you actually start it sort of debugging okay yeah all right we're just gonna do</span></div><div class="c"><span

gonna tag some relevant files</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=1919" target="_blank">00:31:59.920</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=1970" target="_blank">00:32:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this okay i can do a simple version of this but then the complex version is going to be like session</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=1976" target="_blank">00:32:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">management and then follow-ups and things so this is just going to be the basic implementation for now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=1980" target="_blank">00:33:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">um and then like sometimes it especially with bigger code bases it makes stupid mistakes where it'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=1988" target="_blank">00:33:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">implement this everywhere and then forget to like add it to the

so we have like an amperage limit in our brains of how many amps we can have going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=2356" target="_blank">00:39:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">at a time and like actually have things keep up and depending on how rested you are like in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

right and so like i guess the there's also this cognitive thing we had this week</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=2374"

what the question that i'm so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCksand7Iwo&t=2386" target="_blank">00:39:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that's
