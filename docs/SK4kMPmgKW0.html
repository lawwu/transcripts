And now, dear friends, here's Christopher Capozola.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's start with a big and difficult question. How did World War I start? On the one hand,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">World War I started because of a series of events in the summer of 1914 that brought sort of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">major powers of Europe into conflict with one another. But I actually think it's more useful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to say that World War I started at least a generation earlier when rising powers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">particularly Germany, started devoting more and more of their resources toward military</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">affairs and naval affairs. This sets off an arms race in Europe. It sets off a rivalry over the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">colonial world and who will control the resources in Africa and Asia. And so by the time you get to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the summer of 1914, in a lot of ways, I say the war has already begun. And this is just the match</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that lights the flame. So the capacity for war was brewing within like the leaders and within</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the populace. They started accepting sort of slowly through the culture propagated this idea</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that we can go to war, it's a good idea to go to war, it's a good idea to expand and dominate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">others, that kind of thing. Maybe not put in those clear terms, but just the sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that military action is the way that nations operate at the global scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, yes and. So yes, there's a sense that the military can be the solution to political</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">conflict in Europe itself. And the and is that war and military conflict are already happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That there's war, particularly in Africa, in North Africa, in the Middle East, in the Balkans,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">conflict is already underway. And the European powers haven't faced off against each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They've usually faced off against an asymmetrical conflict against much less powerful states.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But in some ways that war is already underway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So do you think it was inevitable? Because World War I is brought up as a case study where it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">seems like a few accidental leaders and a few accidental events or one accidental event led to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the war. And if you change that one little thing, it could have avoided the war. Your sense is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that the drums of war have been beating for quite a while and it would have happened almost no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">matter what or very likely to have happened. Yes, historians never like to say things are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">inevitable. And certainly, you know, there were people who could have chosen a different path,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">both in the short term and the long term. But fundamentally, there were irreconcilable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">conflicts in the system of empires in the world in 1914. I can't see, you know, it didn't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to be this war, but it probably had to be a war. So there was the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Empire, there's France and Great Britain, US, could US be called an empire at that moment yet?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">When do you graduate to empire status? Well, certainly after 1898 with the acquisition of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the former territories of the Spanish Empire, you know, the United States has formal colonial</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">possessions. And it has sort of mindsets of rule and military acquisition that would define</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">empire in a kind of more informal sense. So you would say you would put the blame</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">or the responsibility of starting World War I into the hands of the German Empire</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and Kaiser Wilhelm II? You know, that's a really tough call to make. And, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">deciding that is going to keep historians in business for the next 200 years. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">there are people who would lay all of the blame on the Germans, right? And, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">would point toward a generation of arms buildup, you know, alliances that Germany made and promises</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that they made to their allies in the Balkans, to the Austro-Hungarians. And so, yes, there's an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">awful lot of responsibility there. There has been a trend lately to say, no, it's no one's fault,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">right? That, you know, that all of the various powers literally were sleepwalking into the war,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">right? They backed into it inadvertently. I think that lets everyone a little too much off the hook,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And so I think in between is, you know, I would put the blame on the system of empires</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">itself, on the system. But in that system, the actor that sort of carries the most responsibility</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is definitely Imperial Germany. So the leader of Austro-Hungarian Empire, Franz Josef I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">his nephew is Archduke Franz Ferdinand, he was assassinated. And so that didn't have to lead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to a war. And then the leader of the German Empire, Kaiser Wilhelm II, pressured sort of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">started talking trash and boiling the water that ultimately resulted in the explosion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Plus all the other players. So what can you describe the dynamics of how that unrolled?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, US, what's the role of US? What's the role of France? What's the role of Great Britain,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Germany, and Austro-Hungarian Empire? Yeah, over the course of about four weeks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">right, following the assassination of the Archduke in Sarajevo, it sort of triggers a series of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">political conflicts and ultimately ultimatums, sort of demanding sort of that one or other power</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of stand down in response to the demands of either, you know, Britain, France, or in turn,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Germany or Russia, at the same time that those alliances kind of trigger automatic responses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK4kMPmgKW0&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">from the other side. And so it escalates.
