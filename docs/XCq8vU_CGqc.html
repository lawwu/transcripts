turns out, the law of Christ, that is, the law of love, fulfills the Old Testament commandments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=187"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For the commandments, "You shall not covet, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or whatever commandments there are, are filled up in this word, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think we are turned away from law-keeping as the dominant, defining, primary way we relate to God, to Christ, and to the Holy Spirit, the new way of the Spirit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the question becomes, "Okay, where does tithing fit in?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just taking tithing as a specific example of the law, where does that fit in?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We know it was a way of supporting the Levites.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The Levites didn't have any land, they didn't get an inheritance, and the way that tribe was supported was that all the others were taxed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Namely, they were to give a tent and then bring it, and the Levites would live off the tithes of the people as the people shared.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you could say generally it was a way of supporting the covenantal religious system of that era.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we should ask, "Well, then should that be the way we would support our covenantal system of the church today?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because we know that the New Testament says pastors should be supported.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"You shall not muzzle an ox when he's treading out the grain," and "The laborer deserves his wages," 1 Timothy 5.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The elder should be worthy of double honor in the context of the support of widows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we know that Paul thought that pastors should be paid if they give their whole lives to the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So is that an implication that we should just bring over then the tithe?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Paul's way of dealing with the support is to say, "Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver," 2 Corinthians 9.7.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It seems as though Paul is jealous to raise the money that the people should be giving, not under compulsion and not reluctantly, but cheerfully.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, at the end of the day, as Don Carson likes to say, I would say we should value our riches in Christ in this new covenant relationship so highly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and our freedom from sin so highly and our gospel so highly that we would simply love to give.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus said it is more blessed to give than to receive, and we would be free from a love of things and a dependence on things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we would out-give those who lived under the law because we have a better covenant and a better promise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything is greater with Christ. Why wouldn't giving be greater?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think I preached on tithing two or three times in 33 years at Bethlehem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I talked about giving and sacrifice all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But as far as tithing goes, and when I did, I think the gist of it was, "Brothers and sisters, why would we want to do less?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the person who is saying, "Do I have to?" They're getting off on the wrong foot immediately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything is greater in the new covenant. We have better promises, a better covenant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hebrews says, "Why wouldn't there be better sacrifice, better giving?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCq8vU_CGqc&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you, Pastor John.
