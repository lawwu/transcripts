So it's an incredibly important company, NVIDIA is. I think they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">performing brilliantly. They're running many of the same plays that Intel did to try to create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">total dominance.

So I thought it was a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">important conversation and hopefully we can post it.

And by the way, it's great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to be in Paris, too.

That was that was actually my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the biggest takeaway outside of the actual AI conference itself. But that's a Western City</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">problem.

I've been to Hong Kong,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">but I've not been into China for six years.

My kids were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">just in Japan for spring break.

These Western cities are a bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">chaotic.

We also, at least in San Francisco, we have subsidies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">for people who want to live on the streets and do drugs all day.

So all of our public spaces have been taken over by people who are happy to take the whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it is, $700, $800 subsidy and do drugs all day. We also had this referendum in California that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">essentially lowered a whole bunch of felonies to misdemeanors. Basically, if you steal less than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">$950, that's considered a misdemeanor now instead of a felony. And so there's been a huge increase</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in crime because of that.

And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">misdemeanors don't get prosecuted anymore. We've had all these SOARs, DAs who don't want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=633" target="_blank">00:10:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">prosecute misdemeanors. So I think if voters had understood that lowering a lot of these crimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">from felonies to misdemeanors meant that they wouldn't get prosecuted at all, I don't think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">they would have done it.

But then what's ringing in the back of my ears are these warnings from people that have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">lived there for 10 and 20 years, who've had this stuff happen to them.

That hasn't happened.

I also got to go to this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=900" target="_blank">00:15:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">thing where I spent a lot of time with CIOs and CTOs at other companies, big companies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And a big takeaway for me that I also didn't realize was how most of them are not on a single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">cloud provider. Almost everyone I spoke with is on multiple clouds. So they're all on like AWS</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and Azure and GCP. And they use different aspects of each cloud. And there's a lot of interoperability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">between the clouds now, which I had previously my naive concept of this, because I'm obviously not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">deeply in the space was that a company picks a cloud and they move everything over to that one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">service provider.

So it was pretty clear that everyone is, it's like a race to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">bottom on pricing for basic commoditizing services in the cloud, like data storage, right? And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">whoever has the better higher level services, whoever has access to better models or has a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">lower price on running models, or on running things like inference. That's where the money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is made. And the gross margin on that is quite different. And I think that's where a company</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">like Google probably has a much bigger advantage because of the uniqueness and the quality of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">models that they've developed. But yeah, I just didn't I didn't really appreciate like how much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">there was also. So my other big takeaway was the cloud is a wide open competitive market right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Like there is no AWS lock in in this market.

And the intention was that we would see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">inflation come down to their target of 2% and they would start to lower rates. And obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we're not seeing that inflation is remaining hot.

And I think the Wall Street Journal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1154" target="_blank">00:19:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">put it best.

And I think the expectation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">going into '24 was it would keep going down and we'd get these rate cuts. Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">after three straight months of inflation being more persistent and stickier than people expected,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that narrative is basically dead. So I think the new narrative now is it's going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1230" target="_blank">00:20:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">rates are going to be higher longer. And I think Larry Summers is reflecting that view. Larry's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1236" target="_blank">00:20:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">going further. He's not just saying that rates are going to be, you know, at the current rates</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">for longer, he's saying they might actually increase. And that's a risk. Yeah, last summer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">he said, and this was last summer. So almost a year ago, he was saying, the market's got it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1250" target="_blank">00:20:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">totally wrong. We're actually going to need much higher rates than the market's anticipating for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">much longer, as well, than the market is anticipating. And so did Mario Draghi,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1258" target="_blank">00:20:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">they both said the same thing. No one paid attention to him, everyone ignored it and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1262" target="_blank">00:21:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">assumed that this was going to be a quick rebound to normalization. It's clear that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, once again, Larry has proven himself to be fairly prescient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1269" target="_blank">00:21:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Larry Summers has, for the most part, been spot on from this on this whole inflation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">question going all the way back to 2021. Remember, 100% in Q1 of 2021, Biden's first quarter in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1282" target="_blank">00:21:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">office, the big legislative push was for the $2 trillion COVID relief bill is the so called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1288" target="_blank">00:21:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">American Rescue Plan. And Larry Summers said that it was it risked inflation, it was an inflationary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1294" target="_blank">00:21:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">bill. It was unnecessary. Yeah, we didn't need it. The economy was already coming back, and we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't need it. And Biden was risking inflation. But of course, inflation was only at 2% at that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">point. So the administration kind of poopooed Larry and said, you know, this is Larry Summers being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Larry or whatever. And sure enough, we were at 5% inflation by that summer. And you have to wonder</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1316" target="_blank">00:21:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">if Biden had listened to that advice. Would he be in a different position right now going into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1321" target="_blank">00:22:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">election? I think probably he would have been. And you got to wonder for what I mean, what did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that $2 trillion accomplish? I mean, COVID was winding down. I mean, these were the last bit of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1332" target="_blank">00:22:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">stimmy checks and payments to these pharma companies. And I mean, it was basically a grab</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">bag and it was passed on straight party lines. And it was just totally unnecessary. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1343" target="_blank">00:22:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the economy certainly didn't need it. And so here we are. And I think that a lot of people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">including the markets thought that Biden was kind of out of the woods that this year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1355" target="_blank">00:22:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">we'd see the final leg of inflation going back to normal, but that's not going to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1360" target="_blank">00:22:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think, you know, going beyond the political ramifications, I think there could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1364" target="_blank">00:22:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">several other knock-on effects that we should talk about. I mean, one is for the consumer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">This means that the cost of borrowing is going to be higher for longer. That makes it harder</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1376" target="_blank">00:22:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to buy a house. Mortgage payments are higher. That also means if there's fewer home sale</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1381" target="_blank">00:23:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">transactions, that means the price of housing could come down. So there could be a correction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1386" target="_blank">00:23:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in that market. Second, if you want to buy a car, your car payments higher. And if you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1391" target="_blank">00:23:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">loans, your personal interest is going to be higher. And this is why I think consumers feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">like they're worse off than the economic data would otherwise reflect. And Larry Summers actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1401" target="_blank">00:23:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">had a tweet storm about this about a month ago, where he calculated that if you included the cost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of borrowing in inflation, that inflation was much higher than people thought and that it actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">peaked not at 9%, but at 18%. So Larry had an excellent tweet storm on that. And he said that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the cost of borrowing, which used to be calculated in inflation but is not anymore, was the reason</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">why consumer sentiment about the economy was depressed. He said that that accounted for about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">70% of it. So people should be feeling better off because GDP growth is good and unemployment is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1436" target="_blank">00:23:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">low, but they're not because inflation is so high. And if you include cost of borrowing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1441" target="_blank">00:24:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the inflation is even higher. So I think this is really bad news for Biden. But it's a story</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that's been going on now for three years.

And I think the market, in some cases,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">were predicting as high as four or five.
