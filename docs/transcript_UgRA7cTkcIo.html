And so I've seen people who've been at companies for years and have never done that. And they're kind of maybe waiting for the employer to be like, oh, here you go. And maybe that happens, but often they got to kind of advocate for it.</p><p>And all of a sudden they do it and they're expecting, how dare you, you ingrateful, horrible person, you're fired or whatever. Sometimes it's like, yes, okay, here you go. Other times it's like a, well, not now. And then instead of, I coach them, instead of being like, okay, fine, sorry, sorry.</p><p>They're like, you know what? Okay, can you tell me more about when that might be or what might I do that might warrant that kind of promotion or pay increase? Being in that direct contact with their employer,</p></div></div></body></html>
