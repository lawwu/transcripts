What is too much? What is just enough? Taking that and applying it to an actual real trip. We like to build a scaffolding for people. They have their, their flight in their flight out.</p><p>We know what their big purpose of going on this trip is. It's relaxation. It's seeing the sites, it's eating these meals. It's going to a Taylor Swift concert. And then we put that centerpiece, that capstone somewhere in that trip. Everything else around that. We ask a few questions. How much activity and motion do you want to have?</p><p>How many different things each day do you want to be doing? If you had to cut all of this out and just focus on one thing, what's the thing that matters the most?</p></div></div></body></html>
