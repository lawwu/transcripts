He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">primarily writes about nature, and his writing makes me feel very peaceful and relaxed. I'd</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">love to be able to write like him. I remember you talking about doing this with your own writing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">career. How did you go about it? I'd love to hear your thoughts. Thanks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, Abhishek, there's two things I'd recommend when it comes to improving nonfiction writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">One, yes, dissect. Dissect the authors that you want to emulate and try to replicate their formula</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in your own writing. Now down the line, this will evolve into your own style, but that is deliberate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">practice for style development. As you referenced, I did this back when I was first emerging as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">nonfiction writer. I was trying to understand the then kind of new but quite popular nonfiction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">pop science style of idea writing. So I would dissect Malcolm Gladwell. I remember dissecting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Clive Thompson, maybe some Stephen Johnson. But I would take articles, and I would break it down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would figure out like, OK, here are the sections, and then what happens in each section?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, opening story with a cliffhanger transition, idea introduction back to opening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">story. Like I'd really break these things down. And then I would try to emulate that in articles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I was writing. So great. I am now going to take this style of this article. I broke down the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">formula. I'm going to now try to write my own article that follows that formula. That's how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you actually begin to grow those muscles, see what works, see what doesn't work. It's practice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">with direction. It's what makes practice deliberate and not just repetitious. You know, who used to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">this famously was Ben Franklin. So when Ben Franklin was learning how to write, he would take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">essays or poetry and would break them down to their component parts and then try to replicate it from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">scratch. So he really had a mimic style way of learning because he had no other way of learning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">how to write. He was apprenticed to his brother's printing shop in Boston and wanted to become a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">writer. So he would just literally break down and reconstruct other people's writing. And then he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">started writing anonymous letters for his brother's newspaper in the name of characters. His brother</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't know it was him, but he was at that point able to apply what he learned. And he was a pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">good mimic. And that's where he really developed his style. So I think it's a really effective</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">tactic. So I would definitely recommend you do that. The second thing is, if at all possible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to write for editing. There is a difference in the deliberate practice effect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">between writing something that someone's going to look at and potentially say, "Nope, that's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">good. We're going to reject it or edit it heavily," versus writing for your own blog or writing your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">own journal. And this is what I did. So when I was deconstructing Gladwell, when I was deconstructing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Thompson or Johnson, it wasn't for blog posts. I actually went out and found an online magazine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that had editing, but they needed content. So I was like, "I'm just good enough to get pieces in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">here." But they'll reject them if they're not good. And it was like a serious writers, but the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">magazine never really took off. It was called Flack Magazine. I think it eventually closed down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But it had real editors and they were open to submissions. And there was a period of two years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.120</a></span> | <span class="t">where that was where my writing energy was going. I believe this was primarily between my second</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">book, How to Become a Straight-A Student, and my third book, How to Become a High School Superstar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was between those two periods, which is why superstar actually reads like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">what if Malcolm Gladwell wrote a college admissions book? Because I was doing this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">training and I was focused on this magazine, not because they had a big audience, not because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">anyone ever saw those articles, but because I was deconstructing writers I admired,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">then pitching an article to Flack. And then when they'd accept that pitch, I would write that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">article in a direct emulation of a style and article as deconstructing. Because I was writing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">for editing, it pushed me harder to make that better. The stakes were higher. And then I'd take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">another article and I was like, "Let me try this format." So I pitched an article that allowed me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to practice that format. And then I would practice that format. And that's how I built up my initial</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">nonfiction idea writing chops. It was through exactly that practice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's my two piece of recommendation. Dissect writers, emulate their style,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">if possible, do that emulation for editing so that you have that pressure and feedback to try</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to stretch yourself and make that writing as good as possible. And thank you, by the way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">for being such a longtime reader. The Google Reader Days, those are some of my favorite days,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">2007, 2008. It was like the Study Hacks blog and you had your RSS reader. And I liked that day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">This was before social media had taken over the internet. And it was like interesting people with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting blogs. And you would curate them in your RSS feed and see their articles that came in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember back then being big on the minimalist bloggers. This is when Leo Babuda</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and Zen Habits. This was before the FIRE movement. But I'm trying to think. There's some other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">bloggers like that, people who were doing interesting radical experiments in their life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And they'd write these essays about it. And it was also personal and interesting and creative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just think there was like a high point, early Web 2.0 was this great high point of web</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">production. And then five years later, all that got reduced to Facebook posts and Instagram things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6voBOGFRTGs&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And we kind of lost that moment.
