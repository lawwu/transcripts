Karabeth currently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">serves as the primary advisor for over 125 clients.

I thought it might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">be useful to start with a few general questions, but otherwise Karabeth and I have organized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this session by life stage. So we've got topics to cover for people just getting going with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">their financial plans, as well as for those of you who are further along in your investment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">careers and potentially thinking about retirement or already in retirement. So we're really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">going to hit the whole life cycle during this conversation, but I just want to start with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a few really general questions. Karabeth, you're an hourly fee only advisor. Maybe you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">can talk about why Timothy uses that business model and what sorts of clients, what sorts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">of investors you think it's a good fit for? Yeah, that's a great question. And thank you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">so much for having me today as well. So Timothy got started by our founder Mark Berg about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">20 years ago. And when he started the firm, it was because he was working in a different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">fee only model, asset center management, which is the most prevalent even today, and saw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that there were people out there who weren't working with that type of advisory firm with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">an AUM firm who really could benefit still from financial planning advice and who were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">interested even in receiving that. And so he saw that as both an opportunity and just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a large group of people who weren't able to be served or in that kind of prevalent business</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">model. And so he started Timothy Financial as an hourly financial planning firm 20 years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">ago. We've always been an hourly only financial planning firm. And some of the sorts of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that maybe fit into that group, especially even when he was envisioning it back then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">there may be people who actually have a fair degree of wealth, but it's tied up in an illiquid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">asset like a business. Those people can't work that easily with an asset center management</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">model because there are no liquid assets or very few to be managed and for advisors to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">get paid that way. Similarly, I mean, I'm here in Illinois and there's a number of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">who have quite a bit of their wealth tied up in either state or federal pensions. Again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.820</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe there's quite a few financial planning related questions, even big decisions around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">those assets. But those are not people who are going to be able to be served well under</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that model. Younger people, and I say younger, but not even necessarily right out of college</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.380</a></span> | <span class="t">or something, but maybe people in their 30s and 40s, really in kind of peak accumulation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">years, they may have a large amount of assets already, but maybe not quite hitting minimums</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for some of those other advisory firms, or it's all in a retirement plan that really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">can't be managed by such a firm. So there's all these different groups of people who have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">unique questions and certainly would be served by having an objective advisor come alongside</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of them, but they're not able to get advice in that manner. And then there's just a whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">group of people out there who, and maybe this group today fits into this, who aren't that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">interested in paying for the asset management.

And so if they see an index in their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">portfolio and an individual stock in their portfolio that's outperforming, that is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit harder, or that I have seen that be harder for clients to make the choice to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">sell when stocks are so far up like that.

That is often something I am encouraging clients to do, because of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the psychological difficulties, both on the upside and the downside.

But you want the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1JSsCHICI&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">stock to go up, you don't want to lose money.
