class="t">One thing I think they gain is a little bit of experience taking those speaking skills that they've sharpened and refined through their foundations presentations on a weekly basis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/35633735/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.900</a></span> | <span class="t">They get the opportunity to practice those in a different environment with a different topic, which they have chosen, hopefully because they

href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/35633735/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.520</a></span> | <span

class="t">And so, you know, I think Courtney has already alluded to this, but, you know, being successful at Faces of History is the culmination of lots of little choices and conversations that you have together as a family leading up to that main event where your student gets to sign and costume and share everything that they've researched and that they've learned.</span></div><div

class="t">Of history, looking at your student, having conversations with your student, being able to assess what are the things that come easily or the things that might need a little bit more collaborative work with you and your student.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/35633735/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.780</a></span> | <span

class="t">Yeah, I would just add to what Courtney and Sarah have already shared that as a parent, if you're listening to this and you're an essentials parent and you just have a vision for what the Faces of History event can be, definitely have a conversation with your child's tutor and also with your director.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

love to help with the heavy lifting for something like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
