And his claim is that means he's now breathing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">17.5% oxygen, which is too low. And if he was, that would be too low, 19.5% is kind of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">normal cutoff where people say, oh, not enough oxygen. But actually that's not what's happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me explain why. So you see, he's actually not breathing in the air that is 17.5% oxygen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">he's actually breathing air that's inside the area around the mask, and let me show</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you why that is. That's because when I breathe out, the area between my mouth and the mask</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.980</a></span> | <span class="t">it's too small an area to hold all my breath, and I'll prove it to you. So if I put on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">normal kind of cloth mask that we're all being asked to wear, and I get this bag and I make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">sure it's all squished out so there's no air in it, and then I breathe into it. So the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">thing to point out is that this would not be blown up at all if all of the air was trapped</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">between my face and the mask. In fact, a lot of the air has ended up in here. So we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">estimate how much. So what I'll do is I'll grab a measuring tape, so here's a measuring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">tape which we can grab, and I can take this measuring tape and we can say, well, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is about 9 inches by about 6 inches by about 4 or 5 inches. We're going to call it 4 because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it's kind of rounded off. So we'll call it 9x6x4. So actually what's happened is, next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">time I breathe in, this amount of air is going to come in from the outside of my mask, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit of air is going to come from inside my mask. So let's head over to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">computer and figure out what the percentage of oxygen I'm actually going to breathe in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is. Come with me and we'll have a look. So here's a little spreadsheet I created, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">what we're going to do is we're going to put in the height, width and depth approximately</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of the bag we blew into, and then we'll try to figure out also, we'll just make a guess</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">at how much air might be inside the mask. And then in this spreadsheet we've got the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">starting oxygen level in the air at what the Canadian gentleman said is 20.5 percent, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">then he said in his mask afterwards it was 17.5 percent. So the amount we exhaled into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the bag was 9x6x4 or so, so about 216 cubic inches. So that's the amount that ended up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in the bag, and then what ended up inside our mask? Well, it's probably about, I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">know, half an inch deep between my kind of mouth and the mask that's being probably generous,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and then the area that's kind of not touching my face would be something around maybe 3x4.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that means that we have about 6 cubic inches, probably less than that in practice of air</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">inside my mask and about 216 in the bag. So when I inhale again, it's going to be about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the same mix. So that means about 3 percent of what I inhale is coming from that 17.5</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">percent atmosphere, and the remaining 97 percent is coming from the 20.5 percent. So that means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in practice, I'm going to get 3 percent times 17.5 plus 1 minus 3 percent, 100 minus 3 if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you like, times 20.5. And so my actual oxygen that I'm inhaling is about 20.4 percent. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in practice, it looks like these masks are causing our oxygen levels to go down from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">20.5 to 20.4, so we're losing about 0.1 percent oxygen, not getting anywhere close to that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50QWRrsO8mM&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">dangerous level of 19.5 percent.
