Then we took a quick tour of the office. I found both the Kama 2 system and the entire Kama AI team and operation very impressive. Plus I got a 3D printer named after me.</p><p>As one robot to another, we're in this together my brother. And now on to the ride and tour with George Hotz. I'm here with uh driving with George Hotz and uh looking at the Kama 2. Trying to find a stretch of road where we can enable it. Yeah just start looping back to the office.</p><p>I mean I could enable it here but this isn't really where it shines. Yeah so we don't have we don't have our license stop signs yet. Um I don't want to ship it until we have a real uh holistic one. Until we have an end to end one. So you'll be able to then like stop at a stop sign.</p><p>So the longitudinal control. Did you just enable it? I just enabled it yeah. So this is the uh so we're gonna have to stop at this light. But um how do you enable it? Uh cruise control. So that's that's the the integrated knobs on the on the car. Yeah we have a good we'll go on the 163 a bit and that's that's that's a good test of uh whether your level two system's any good.</p><p>Supercruise actually can't do it. Supercruise can't do it because they're they're not good enough with roll on the road. Autopilot can do it and we can do it. How's San Diego in terms of quality of roads and lane markings and all that kind of stuff? Pretty mediocre like the rest of California.</p><p>What's your favorite uh reason for using KAMA? Like when when do you find the most joy? Oh oh it's it's long trips. It's um you know driving from here to LA. You'll do it without a disengagement almost. You can you can you know it's two hours to LA from here.</p><p>You could just go to LA. Uh get in your car and you just sit there and watch. And it's it's a it's a great time. All right so we can we can engage here. So you know watch. So it doesn't technically require perfect lane markings? No not at all.</p><p>In fact you can do lane changes on roads that don't have lane markings because it's all end to end. So I have to get over three lanes. I'm just going to take control here to do it. Especially since there's a cop there. So let me just get over three lanes and then this road's a decent demo.</p><p>Yeah so I think only us and Autopilot can do this road. Pretty curvy. Yeah and uh it's not just curvy it's also banked. Um and if you don't yeah if you don't do that well if you don't have a model that can detect that. Um so the longitudinal policy is actually just being done by the car.</p><p>Um Hyundai has quite a competent ACC. Probably the best one. Uh so we haven't really felt the urge to move to our gas and brakes. There's a few cute things where which ours will do better and more holistically than than theirs. But um really it's about the turning. How hard is it to get it to be this smooth?</p><p>Uh hard. Five years of engineering. All of this end to end huh? When we're detecting the lane lines they're used but they're more used as uh see like right there that's the stock system being too harsh on the brakes. If you're a human driving you would have been much more gradual on the brakes there.</p><p>But we're really going to push to switch all the longitudinals to open pilot once we have end-to-end longitudinal and the same way we have end-to-end lateral. What's harder end-to-end longitudinal or end-to-end lateral? We put a lot more work into end-to-end lateral because there's a lot more subtlety in that.</p><p>The car companies have managed to build competent longitudinal. We have competent longitudinal using old school policies. But lateral there's so much subtlety. For example like when a lane splits out should you follow that split? Should you stay in the center or should you stay to one side or so much subtlety there.</p><p>And making it all smooth and not freak out. Yeah and this thing you know the reason I feel very confident keeping my hands off the wheel our torque limit is so much lower than Tesla's. So you can't can't do anything crazy? No we do injection tests where one person sits in that seat with a joystick and the other person keeps their hands off the wheel and that person you can't look at them they're free to jam the joystick in any direction and if you don't feel you know safe in that maneuver they take back over here because we're getting off here.</p><p>But yeah that stretch of road is a is a is a competent demonstration of open pilot. Yeah that was impressive. It's not the high end. Maybe when we get to the city streets I'll engage on the city streets. Is city streets like a compelling use case or is that just kind of without it?</p><p>Intuition builder. Without end-to-end longitudinal it's pretty like it's not really useful as product. So it's more just it's cool that it can do it and like we don't gate it off but most of open pilot is highways like most of the value real gain is highways. But also not just highways also like one lane each way kind of things like double yellow kind of roads.</p><p>I was doing all like the mountains up in Colorado with this thing and just you get to look at the mountains before it drives. So like I can engage it here. Now remember the longitudinal policy is is Hyundai and it's not ideal for cities. But so again we're going to go through this intersection with no lines.</p><p>See notice how there's no line there yet our placement is still almost human ideal. Yeah this is great. So there I mean there you see we did a stretch of you know a minute of city and perfectly human nothing sketchy. See places like that or where disengage on gas is really nice.</p><p>Really easy to you know hand off you always know when that handoff is happening with the noise. It didn't like keep the ACC on or anything. God if it kept the ACC on and I make the turn and it's like trying to accelerate at a weird time you know just asking to have a bad time.</p><p>I like the the sounds the visual it's like clear when it's on and when it's off. Love it. Well done. Damn that's impressive. That's really impressive. That's the intersections without thinking about it. Okay that was awesome. It's communicating the uncertainty with this movement a little bit. I like it.</p><p>Humans actually wobble a little more than you think too. You notice it a lot more when they're this. Yeah that's an interesting point yeah. Yeah true. I think Jesse Levinson mentioned this on one of his interviews. He's like so you know we have all these we have the safety driver sit in the car and mark every tiny mistakes it made and then we also had the safety driver sit in a car that was being human driven and mark all the little tiny mistakes it made.</p><p>So this is the comma office in downtown. The comma office is right here. We're at uh comma AI offices with uh Mr. George Harts. Can you give us a little tour? It doesn't light up anymore I don't know why. Do you think most of these dashboards are okay? They're almost at 30 million open pilot miles.</p><p>Wow. Oh it's a hell of a number. So here here's dailies, weeklies and uh so actually yeah dailies are like maybe not 2,000 1.5. So those are used daily and then used weekly. Yeah. That's really cool. Weeklys are almost 2.5 and monthly is a little over 3. This is how many devices are on our botnet in the last hour.</p><p>Botnet last day, botnet last week. Is this all over the United States? This is no this is everywhere. So here's here's here's the maps. Here's the map of the world. Uh so we're everywhere in the world. So let's see. In the last 30 days we had 2,200 in the U.S.</p><p>and then Korea, Canada, Taiwan, Japan. Japan's up there. This is our percent engaged. So percent of miles engaged is about 50 percent. Percent time engaged is about 30. Our disengagements are split pretty evenly between cancel, gas and break. Most of our segments are now coming from Comma 2s. Comma 2s.</p><p>Comma 2 is the big the big breakout for this company. Yeah. Oh yeah. That's profitable. This is our live link to the Europe office. It comes as a multinational corporation. George just erased a bunch of top secret things. Censorship. The censors came in. Yeah. Look the mission's at the top of the board.</p><p>Solve self-driving cars while delivering shippable intermediaries. Amen. What do we do badly? What can we do better? Right. Good questions. Open pilot 1.0. When is that coming up? When those things are done. PyTorch. Okay. I like how that's the bullet point. That's like move everything to PyTorch. Oh, sorry.</p><p>It's not a data center. It's a compute cluster. For legal reasons, it's a compute cluster. It's a compute cluster. Okay. That sounds sexier too. Data ingestion, multi-chain. Cool. So this is like a vision board for OpenPilot 1.0. It's not going to happen for a while. But the Comma 2 is going to get OpenPilot 1.0.</p><p>It's like what I said with the hardware. So this is all going to come to the Comma 2 just with OTAs. OTA, over the air. We're going to get it. Yeah. I mean, we're getting close on a lot of these. I'm going to start lowering the wheel touch timeout.</p><p>Alex, this is Alex. Hi. She's our COO. COO. Nice. Nice to meet you. She runs the back there stuff. What's the technical description of the back there stuff? You want to see? Yeah. I think it's more exciting than this stuff. It depends who you ask. We're ahead of all the secrets, right?</p><p>Nick, do we have any secrets out? I'll blur it out. I'll blur the top secrets. This is production. Stress test. This is our final test. The Comma 2s hang out here for about 24 hours. We test them for their heat, their temperature, their light sensors. We do cosmetic checks, screen checks.</p><p>Pretty exciting. You can see they all start over there as phones. Then they get retrofit. Then they go full house fit. You can see we have a class of 100 phones out right now. They're getting tested. It's kind of exciting actually. Lex, this is Mitchell. He's the latest addition to our machine learning team.</p><p>That's Chris, also known as Virtually Chris. He's a famous YouTuber. Oh, wow. How did fame change you? I introduced you as a famous YouTuber. Yes, I was the open pilot YouTuber. Don't let it get to your head. That's our head of hardware. Awesome. What's that stage of the assembly?</p><p>This is the final case. We have board testing. Then the retrofit phones get board put on them, soldered to them. We get the heat sink and the fan. Then we put the cases on them. Awesome. Yeah, they're taking cases off, screens off here. They're testing screens over here. Oven.</p><p>Yeah, 3D printer. You want to show that? I will too. I'm afraid to take it in there. It's very hot and loud. It's also the home of the compute cluster. It's not a data center. It's not a data center. That's right. It's a compute cluster. Prepare yourself. It's the sound of productivity.</p><p>Yeah. Oh my God, it's really hot. Fresh bag, cases. This is what you see on the outside of the Comma 2s. These are all of our printers. Yeah, I like how they have names. Meg. What's the purpose of the rings? They used to be for athletic activity, but now we have too many printers.</p><p>You can't anymore. We just got about 20 printers in the last few months. They've come from all over the world. Literally, Poland, Germany, Peru, France. How long does it take to print a single one? Yes, we'll name number 49 for you, Lex. Thank you. We'll call him Lex. I told him he could be number 49.</p><p>I could be. So great, 49's not working right now, but I promise 49 will work. It'll be Lex number 49. I appreciate that. That would mean a lot to me. This is cool. So unfortunately, because we got to keep the bugs and dust out, they're covered, but 1U. I already forgot their official name.</p><p>The compute cluster. So these are our CPU machines. We have three racks that look like that. Two petabytes of spinning disks. We're at 3080s. Our 3080s are in only desktop computers for non-business purposes. These are our GPU machines. What's in there? V100s. It's like a farm. Every day we kind of go out.</p><p>21st century farm. We got to hire a good farm bill player to come farm us. These are the ones that are ready to ship. I think these are all of our growing harnesses. These are all the hardware support. Bosch, Deliver, Nynex, Subaru, Toyota, all the Hyundais. All the way to J, Nissan, VW.</p><p>All these are assembled by hand? Yeah. That's cool. That's amazing. That's legit. That's awesome. Yeah, I don't know. That's the office. Have you been for a ride among the cars? Yeah. He took me for a ride. It was awesome. It was really surprising how well it worked. Where'd you take him on the highway?</p><p>We did like the 163. In the city a little bit too. It held up. Definitely. You didn't show him any secrets, though, did you? No, I didn't show him any secrets. It means like keep on driving, you know? That's why we replaced it with a heart. We're all big Elon fans.</p><p>Elon's success is our success. If iOS succeeds, Android succeeds. Thanks. you you you you you you you</p></div></div></body></html>
