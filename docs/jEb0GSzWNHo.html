But there's one point in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">particular that I want to highlight because I think it's particularly relevant to the modern</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">digital environment. So again, I'm going to quote from the article here. This is Derek talking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">one of multiple problems with solitude.

This neededness can come in several forms,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">social, economic, or communitarian.

I think we can kill this here, Jesse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">In my book "Digital Minimalism," which actually made a lot of points that I think are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">being underscored by the experts in this article, I made this related argument where I said, look,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">when it comes to sociality, what our brain really looks for is us sacrificing non-trivial time and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">attention on behalf of someone else. So we have evolved to think about, if I am sacrificing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">non-trivial time and attention, so reproductively relevant, survival-relevant resources,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">on behalf of another person, that person is someone with whom I have an important connection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're connected.

The problem is, if you're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">sacrificing non-trivial time and attention on behalf of someone, you don't get to draw a line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we're seeing a lot of people's social graphs are sparse. And if your social graph</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is sparse, you're not feeling that neededness that Reeves talked about. So I just think this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is two sides of the same coin. He talks about neededness. That's a subjective description</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of what it means to have a connection to an individual community, that they need you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you play an important role. I use sacrifice of non-trivial resources as a sort of quantitative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">or functional description of what this type of connection means. It's about what are you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">actually giving up on behalf of another person. So the more of these actual neededness or sacrifice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">connections you have to other people around you, the more resilient you become, the more fulfilled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you become, the more satisfied you become about your life. So why then is this dissolving, as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Reeves points out in Derek Thompson's article? Well, I think technology plays a major role in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that story of dissolution. And it does so in two major ways that sort of work together into a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">negative symphony. So the first type of way where the modern digital technology plays a role in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is it leads us away from that type of behavior, that sacrifice of non-trivial time and attention</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that's really required to feel connected to someone. Let's think about the ways in which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it does this.

Because it gives</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">us a sense, if you're a user, that you're a part of a community.

Video games are doing the same thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">especially for young men.

The final way the technology I think is leading</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to this actually comes from the world of work.

So like I write about in my book, Slow Productivity, we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">pseudo productivity, the management heuristic that visible activity is a proxy for useful effort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">combined with mobile computing. So now I can do work at a very visible fine grained level in any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">location on earth. Those two things have made us very, very busy, especially or notably outside</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of our normal work hours. Of course, I wrote a whole book about this. But from the point of view</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of what we're talking about here, neededness in the social graph, being more and more busy outside</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of normal work hours means there's less and less time to sacrifice non-trivial time and attention</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">on behalf of other people. So that too is getting in the way of building these strong social graphs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">which give us that sense of neededness. All right, so modern technology is playing a big role</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in this solitude problem.

Once we know what's going on here, the solutions are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">obvious.

Well, that's what it's like using the internet without a VPN because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1343" target="_blank">00:22:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">every time you connect to an unencrypted network, at the airport, you're at the hotel, you're at a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1348" target="_blank">00:22:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">coffee shop, your online data is not secure.

And then you send that to a VPN server, then the VPN</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">server unencrypts it, talks to that site or service on your behalf, encrypts the response, sends it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1375" target="_blank">00:22:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">back to you.

I'm a medical doctor switching specialties. This requires I study for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1452" target="_blank">00:24:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">entrance exams.

This leaves only the weekends to study. How can I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">improve on scheduling and following through on weekdays? Well, as I learned doing research for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1468" target="_blank">00:24:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">last week's episode on morning routines, I think the key is, and Jesse will agree with me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1472" target="_blank">00:24:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is to do your studying from within a cold plunge. Because what that's going to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1476" target="_blank">00:24:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is the cytokines are going to sharpen your focus muscles, and then it's going to be very difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1483" target="_blank">00:24:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, what you need to do is in the cold plunge. You need a cold plunge that's deep enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1488" target="_blank">00:24:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that you can do pull-ups while in the cold plunge.

Okay, let's get to the heart of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1500" target="_blank">00:25:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this here. Kay, I'm going to tell you first of all to use a phrase from the older episodes of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1507" target="_blank">00:25:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">show, to face the productivity dragon here, which means confronting and accepting the reality of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1513" target="_blank">00:25:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">particular workload that you're struggling with. You have a very hard job, and so you're finding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1520" target="_blank">00:25:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it hard to also do a lot of hard studying after your job is over. That is just the reality. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1525" target="_blank">00:25:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">not a broken thing. It's not unusual. It's not inexplicable. It's not a problem. In fact, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1531" target="_blank">00:25:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">not at all surprising. It's hard to be a doctor. Those are long shifts. And so the study, something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1538" target="_blank">00:25:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">intense after a hard shift, might just be really hard. So we have to just accept that at first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1543" target="_blank">00:25:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But we can't see it. To ignore the productivity dragon is just to really want something to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">doable, to be frustrated that it's not, and just hope if you get upset enough or focus on it enough,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1558" target="_blank">00:25:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you can just sort of make it possible. That dragon is there, and sometimes it's going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">block you from getting where you want to go. All right, once we accept that, now we can review what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1568" target="_blank">00:26:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">are our options and tools here without yet trying to assess whether any of these is going to solve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1573" target="_blank">00:26:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the problem. Let's just put on the table, there's a dragon up here. All right, townspeople, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1578" target="_blank">00:26:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">weapons do we have? Let's see what we have, and then we can build a plan. So in your case, there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a few things that could be relevant. Better energy could help, right? There's things you could do so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1588" target="_blank">00:26:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that you're coming off of your shift, you have higher energy, maybe you're able to persist in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1591" target="_blank">00:26:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">more studying than you are now. These are things like sleep, exercise, and nutrition. Those are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1596" target="_blank">00:26:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">probably the big ones, maybe with a good shutdown routine from the doctor job. In theory, if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1603" target="_blank">00:26:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in really good shape and have really good health, in theory, you probably would have more energy you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1610" target="_blank">00:26:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">could probably spare. I don't know if that's going to be a lot because the physical and intellectual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1615" target="_blank">00:26:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">are related, but they're not completely congruent. But that's a tool we have on our table.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That might take a while, though, to get healthy, to get in good shape, but that takes time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1623" target="_blank">00:27:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And kind of ironically, you don't have a lot of time each day to work on this. We could get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1627" target="_blank">00:27:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">around that, doctors get around that, they work out at the hospital, etc. But it takes a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1632" target="_blank">00:27:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">time to get in, you know, to get healthier. And you might have to be done with this in a couple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1635" target="_blank">00:27:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">months. Alright, another tool, though, better study habits. So if you're using the right study</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1641" target="_blank">00:27:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">habits, maybe a shorter amount of time per day, you can get more out of it. Also, studying is less</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1647" target="_blank">00:27:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">exhausting when it's more focused and you trust it, right? When you're a really good studier,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1652" target="_blank">00:27:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I was a really good studier, I wrote books about how to study. When you're a really good studier,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1656" target="_blank">00:27:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a lot less exhausting. Why? Because the sense of exhaustion from studying in particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1663" target="_blank">00:27:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is sometimes generated from your mind having resistance to the activity that you're about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1668" target="_blank">00:27:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to do. It doesn't want to do it. So it's like, I don't want to do this. And now you're competing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1672" target="_blank">00:27:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">with your mind trying to drag it into this activity. That's exhausting and not super</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1676" target="_blank">00:27:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">sustainable. Why does your mind reject studying? Well, one of the reasons why it rejects it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1683" target="_blank">00:28:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">because studying is not a precise verb. Your mind doesn't think you have a particularly good plan</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1689" target="_blank">00:28:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">for how you're going to get prepared. Your mind knows that you're just going to sit down and open</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1692" target="_blank">00:28:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">up your books and then look at your phone and then look at your instant messenger and then kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1696" target="_blank">00:28:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">read some things and kind of look over at something else.

And so it holds back motivation. So now you're dragging your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1706" target="_blank">00:28:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">mind through it. By contrast, if you're a really good studier, your mind's like, oh, yeah, we got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=1710" target="_blank">00:28:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a good plan.

But the other thing is they have a lot of extra text</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=2544" target="_blank">00:42:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">because of all the platforms. All their platforms have these giant archives of text, and text is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=2548" target="_blank">00:42:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what you need to train these. And so maybe they can eke out some more training, like OpenAI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=2553" target="_blank">00:42:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">who maybe is just limited to the full open Internet and every book ever written. So to also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=2557" target="_blank">00:42:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">have everything ever said on Facebook, that's more text. So more text helps. But we're kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=2560" target="_blank">00:42:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">of running out of text to train these things on.

Now, there's different training methods that matter, right? Like the O1 model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=2582" target="_blank">00:43:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and I don't want to go down too deep down this rabbit hole, but the newest chat GPT is better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=2586" target="_blank">00:43:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">at reasoning. And this is in part due to the way they train it now. It turns out you can make these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=2592" target="_blank">00:43:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">things a little bit better at, feed forward networks better at reasoning if you do a particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=2596" target="_blank">00:43:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">type of training where what you really do is you say, when you give an answer, it's a simple idea,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=2601" target="_blank">00:43:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but it has a huge impact.

When you give an answer, chat GPT, we want you to explain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=2612" target="_blank">00:43:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">your steps that lead to your answer.

This is how they train these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=2630" target="_blank">00:43:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">models not to like say bad things or to avoid certain topics.

Like, hey, show your work. So if I ask you like a math problem,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=2639" target="_blank">00:43:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">don't just say the answer to that math problem is 27, I'm going to give you a happy zap if instead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=2644" target="_blank">00:44:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of just saying that, you say, well, let's walk this through. We started with this many apples,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=2648" target="_blank">00:44:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and we took away this apple, so we've left this many apples, so now the answer is 27.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=2651" target="_blank">00:44:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So by zapping it, like, hey, we really like when you show your work. Now, when you're training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=2656" target="_blank">00:44:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">these networks, they're more likely to train in a way that actually captures more of the logic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=2661" target="_blank">00:44:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">because they have to actually say the steps along the way, and then they're more likely to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=2666" target="_blank">00:44:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">reasoning better.

Because writers are full-time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3756" target="_blank">01:02:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">writers, and you sometimes have to be pretty much elite to do it full-time, have that type of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3762" target="_blank">01:02:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">ability to be more seasonal. Elite athletes, I actually think about as practitioners of slow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3766" target="_blank">01:02:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">productivity as well. I mean, they do one thing. They're sport. They're not working on 30 things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3772" target="_blank">01:02:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">They're not answering emails and jumping off and on calls. They're training for their sport. Of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3777" target="_blank">01:02:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">course they obsess over quality. That's what makes them elite athletes. And their work is literally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3782" target="_blank">01:03:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">seasonal. Here's the sport season. Here's the off-season. We treat these things very differently,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3787" target="_blank">01:03:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">so they have different rhythms of their week. Elite academics, often they become elite because,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3793" target="_blank">01:03:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">again, they are slow productivity practitioners as well. Hey, I'm focusing on just this result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3799" target="_blank">01:03:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Academia is very seasonal, teaching, non-teaching, but also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3805" target="_blank">01:03:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">working on a result and being done with a result.

And they obsess over quality. Now, of course, a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3812" target="_blank">01:03:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">academic positions have the slow productivity subverted by the injection of the administrative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3818" target="_blank">01:03:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But in this context, we note that's a problem. They say, I'm worse at being a professor now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3823" target="_blank">01:03:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">because I have to do all this administrative work. So what made them elite was not the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3828" target="_blank">01:03:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">busyness you see of a later stage career professor holding all these administrative positions. What</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3833" target="_blank">01:03:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">made them elite is when they were more true to the slow productivity principles. So I see it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3838" target="_blank">01:03:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, what's missing here, you mentioned balance. I think what you mean by balance is like the total</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3842" target="_blank">01:04:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">number of hours you're working in a day is not too bad. Athletes, I guess, violate that because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3848" target="_blank">01:04:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it takes a lot of hours if you're just in a season. Yeah. Writers don't work a huge number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3852" target="_blank">01:04:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of hours. So I think that's still OK. Elite academics, they can work a lot of hours. Yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3857" target="_blank">01:04:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, especially if it's a lab-based academia. So fair enough on that point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3861" target="_blank">01:04:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">There are, of course, you mentioned Elon Musk, that points towards the idea that there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3865" target="_blank">01:04:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">careers in which elite level is not really compatible with slow productivity principles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3869" target="_blank">01:04:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Entrepreneurship is probably the classic example of that, like starting up a company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3873" target="_blank">01:04:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You just, you aren't doing one thing.

And it's not really obsessing over quality because you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=3881" target="_blank">01:04:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">have time or energy to do that.

So what do I want to get done this week? Well, let's see,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=4062" target="_blank">01:07:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">if I could finish a draft of chapter three this week, that would actually be good.

Like today's big, you know, this week's focus is working on chapter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=4071" target="_blank">01:07:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">three.

All right, so I'll keep that in mind first. Second, okay, so what happens if you have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=4094" target="_blank">01:08:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of stuff waiting to hear back from?

The status has changed. I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=4161" target="_blank">01:09:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">heard back.

I'm going to put that back,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=4164" target="_blank">01:09:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, under whatever column is appropriate.

And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=4180" target="_blank">01:09:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">also, you know, I'm pretty loose about these things.

But you know, hey, sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=4199" target="_blank">01:09:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">things take longer or you lose some admin blocks, you don't get them done.

Like the critical stuff is going to end up being a part of my weekly plan</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=4208" target="_blank">01:10:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and probably make its way onto my calendar. So hopefully that makes sense about waiting for,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=4212" target="_blank">01:10:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">just because you've been waiting for something for a while, doesn't mean you have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=4215" target="_blank">01:10:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">act on it right away when it comes back to you.

And I think one of the points we made is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=4259" target="_blank">01:10:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, don't be too stressed about this.

In some ways, it's something more insidious, but in other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=4985" target="_blank">01:23:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">ways, it's something that feels like it's much more solvable because it feels much less important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=4989" target="_blank">01:23:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Its grasp is hard, but its grounding is shallow. So I actually came away from this like, "Oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=4995" target="_blank">01:23:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">not as scary because no one's fighting me on this.

You see one of these services being banned. That also just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=5010" target="_blank">01:23:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">helped change their mindset of like, "Yeah, these things are kind of optional. It was okay. We took</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=5013" target="_blank">01:23:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that one away. We all survived." It just kind of emphasizes the optionality, the triviality,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEb0GSzWNHo&t=5019" target="_blank">01:23:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the tangentiality of these services.
