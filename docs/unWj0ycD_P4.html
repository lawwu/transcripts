class="t">What you're doing at Betterment as the Director of Behavioral Science and Investing is extremely interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I thought it'd be great to have you on the show so you can talk with us about all the work that you're doing there and all the neat stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like you're in this big lab in real world and you get to actually run experiments on real people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and do real things as opposed to theory, sort of an ivory tower classroom setting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So can you tell us a little bit about who you are and how you ended up at Betterment?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a great place to be, but with great power comes great responsibility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll trace out so that I think it's actually useful for the path that I got here by.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's interesting that it explains my background a bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I did my graduate degree in decision science, which is a combination of psychology and game theory and statistics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So trying to figure out how to help people, real people, make better decisions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I had never had any desire to go into finance or investing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But during that program, one of the people who I worked with said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">why don't you come and work with my investment company for a little while?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I thought, you know, I heard that these people get paid well and it sounds really interesting what they're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I went and did that and I worked there for about a year and it was an incredible experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Learning very quickly the difference between academic finance and real world finance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And after doing that for a year, I realized that that specific kind of finance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a private equity firm, was not what I wanted to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this job came up at Barclays Wealth in the UK, which is a high net worth asset management firm,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">doing applied behavioral finance, trying to help advisors give better advice,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">not only in terms of it fitting to the client better,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but also the client being more likely to adhere to it, to actually go through with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I worked there for about six years with advisors,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">both building behavioral tweaks to the platforms as well as integrating it into their advice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the things that kept striking me, as you've alluded to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is that there's this three body problem going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have the end investor who's going to come with their specific circumstances,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but also their psyche and their particular strengths and weaknesses as an individual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you have the same thing for the advisor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's me sort of in the background trying to change the system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to change the system and the advisors and coach them and train them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to see if we can help the end client be better off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's a very noisy environment to be in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The feedback is delayed and noisy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're never really sure if what you are doing is actually working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I moved to the U.S. and I started looking at Betterment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It struck me as a great opportunity to improve upon both of these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So number one, I, as a behavioral scientist, can try to improve things with clients,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but test it in a rigorous fashion in the real world, see what impact it has on the behavior,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and if it works, roll it out to all of them and have high confidence that it actually works</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">rather than hope that it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you were looking at Betterment as an option,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and you liked the idea that it was a real-time experiment with real investors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">At the time, the company was up and running and they were using index funds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Did you give it any thought to why John Stein had chosen index funds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and why that was the focus of the investment philosophy behind Betterment?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there are a lot of reasons to go with index funds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.000</a></span> | <span

just charging 25 basis points to our retail clients.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=2295" target="_blank">00:38:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And over the years, we learned that, number one, some people wanted more of a CFP engagement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=2302" target="_blank">00:38:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We found that there's a lot of upfront costs.</span></div><div class="c"><span

circumstances,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=2309" target="_blank">00:38:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then have one or two calls with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=2312" target="_blank">00:38:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they didn't want to start again from scratch later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=2314" target="_blank">00:38:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we started offering what we called Betterment Premium,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=2316" target="_blank">00:38:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which was 40 basis points instead of 25 basis points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=2319" target="_blank">00:38:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was an annual fee, so that you were kind of locked in for one year at 40 basis points rather than 25.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=2326" target="_blank">00:38:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the uptake on that was just of a very specific person who wanted kind of like that ongoing relationship,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=2333" target="_blank">00:38:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where they wanted to be able to call us anytime, which was a subset of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=2337" target="_blank">00:38:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think a lot of people think like you think, which is, well, actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=2340" target="_blank">00:39:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I just have this specific question that I want an answer and some guidance on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=2344" target="_blank">00:39:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and I don't want that to translate into this long ongoing relationship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=2349" target="_blank">00:39:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So about six months or a year ago, we started offering what we call Advice Packages,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=2354" target="_blank">00:39:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which are modular little a

| <span class="t">and I want to understand what's involved in merging our finances and the options there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=2364" target="_blank">00:39:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or planning for a kid's college education, or optimizing Social Security in

the person doesn't feel like they need advice tied to their assets in any way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=2374" target="_blank">00:39:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but they do want, as you said, a conversation with an expert, somebody to take a look at it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=2379" target="_blank">00:39:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">check their work, make sure that they're doing the right thing.</span></div><div

them set up a bit of the execution for it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unWj0ycD_P4&t=2386" target="_blank">00:39:46.000</a></span> | <span
