Jonathan King was a new author to me in 2018. I discovered that in seminary he studied under Michael Horton,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and he completed his PhD work at TEDS under Kevin Van Hooser. Jonathan now serves as lecturer in the Faculty of Liberal Arts at the Universitas Paulina Harapan in Indonesia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Today I am breaking the mold. This will be a long conversation. I suspect it'll go an hour or so. Jonathan joins me from his apartment in Jakarta.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's 7 a.m. in Minneapolis, 8 p.m. Jakarta. I'm still waking up. Jonathan, hello. Thank you for your book, "The Beauty of the Lord, Theology as Aesthetics."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As you know, for many of us, beauty is a very subjective concept. Divine beauty is, for us, really even more abstract altogether.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But here at DG, of course, we love talking about God's beauty, Christ's beauty, the beauty of the cross even, and of course we should.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Aesthetically, of course, all of us are moved by beautiful music, beautiful paintings, beautiful images that we like on Instagram.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We respond to beauty instinctually. In your excellent book, you argue that divine beauty is objective. It's defined by a certain fittingness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's dive right into it. Take as long as you need. Explain this connection for us between beauty and fittingness in scripture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's something like the definition of beauty that I start with as my baseline is coming from the early classical, patristic, and medieval period,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where the concept of beauty was not a sideline and it certainly wasn't just a subjective thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The gist of the definition of beauty is something like this. Beauty is an intrinsic quality of things which, when it's perceived, pleases the mind by a certain kind of fittingness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, it's contextual, but within a given context, when you perceive something, you see it's both objective with a subjective response elicited to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I apply the idea of fittingness as an overarching term, which captures the range of aesthetic properties that identify innumerable qualities of beauty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So fittingness, of course, is with the same type of quality may or may not be fitting within a given context of beauty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why I think it's a very good term, kind of a more of an umbrella type of term, but a term that can be applied.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you wouldn't just say something has – the delicacy of something or the boldness or something is a fine quality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You would say within a certain setting, a certain dimension, a certain context, it is or is not fitting, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the judgment of fittingness, therefore, it implies a judgment about the degree to which something or someone exhibits beauty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So – but that something or someone is not limited to an object or a thing as we normally think of in such terms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It includes actions and expressions as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you want me to – you've asked about relating beauty and fittingness in regards from Scripture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, right at the very beginning of Scripture, you know, God created the heavens and the earth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course, in the Greek, that's captured by the word cosmos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And cosmos itself implies an ordered arrangement of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a combination of both orderliness and adornment, and it's kind of embedded within that meaning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The Hebrew text, of course, doesn't use – you know, it doesn't use the word universe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But when it talks about the heavens and the earth or the host of heaven, for instance, in the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew text, we – it's used the word cosmos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, as an example, in Acts 1724, of course, in the New Testament, it says, "The God who made the world," cosmos, "and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I don't want to, you know, make – you know, try to wring too much out of this, but I do want to just kind of set the stage that right from the beginning, the creation, there's implied a certain orderliness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then from that, do we see fittingness in different ways?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then being spelled out in – right at the beginning of the Bible, when God makes his assessment of the days of creation being good, and then ultimately, at the end of day six, all of creation being very good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The assessment there includes an assessment of God's delight in his creation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The word tov, the Hebrew word tov, is not just something that's proper and good in some functional sense, but it has ethical and aesthetic connotations as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Reflecting on the translation of that text into Greek in the Septuagint, those translators translated tov to the Greek word kailos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Kailos is rich with aesthetic connotation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, it's – it has this idea of being aesthetically beautiful, morally excellent, noble, organically sound, desirable, praiseworthy, such things as that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I guess what I want to highlight here is that we have a thick theological – we want to have a thick theological picture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right from the very project of creation itself, we want to have that thickness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And not importing – we don't have to import anything in artificially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's their kind of implied connotations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the fittingness we see right in the way that – the aesthetic sense of fittingness is right in the way God set up the realms and the habitants of those realms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We see how the forming of habitations characterizes the first three days, while the filling of those habitations with inhabitants respectively fit for them, characterizes days four to six.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, the artistic patterning depicting the archetypal week of creation displays the aesthetic aspect entails in God's expressed covenant creational purposes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that's just one example, kind of, you know, at the beginning, but what we can kind of tease out is that things – there is a fittingness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if there ever should be a fittingness that is consequential, it needs to be right at the very beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, that it was intended and designed and created by God just so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, in terms of the more – I don't know what's – going back to God as creator and the very nature of God, what I want to – what I argue is that beauty corresponds in some way to the attributes of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, when I get to the doctrine of God part of my book, which is chapter two, I do argue strongly and definitively that beauty actually is an attribute of God, not just somehow associated with the attributes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, we start off with just kind of posing that question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then – but as an attribute of God, as part of God's nature or somehow reflective of his nature, the work of God, the work of God outside of himself, creation, redemption, consummation, the overall work and all the work of God is – my claim, my argument is that it's – there's a consistent and fitting expression of the outworking of God's beauty, of divine beauty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, create – all that God does is certainly more than just beautiful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's not less than that either.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's all imbued inherently because the – at least in my – what I'm putting forward is that beauty is inherent to God and it's reflective of everything that he does, which is the outward expression of his glory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So – but where this really comes to its kind of concreteness, you know, it's not just in talking about the nature of God in his triuneness and so forth, although as fun – as critical as that needs to be established or at least kind of argued for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, in the expression of God in the person of Christ, the most central claim, the most central claim after arguing that beauty is – it's appropriate to say that beauty is part of God's very nature and it's a quality of the very outward expression of his glory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I argue that the sun's fittingness as incarnate redeemer is the critical lens for seeing God's beauty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=598"

up, you know, until his death and then post-death, his resurrection, ascension into heaven, there's – the form of Christ was not just static, was not just the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He presented himself in a very humble means and that was all

refer to that as Christ being in the state of his humiliation prior to his exaltation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a fittingness throughout the entire life of Christ and that fittingness is kind of – captures or at least points to the idea that it's sourced from the very beauty of God itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.000</a></span> | <span

to talk history for a moment and then return to something fascinating that you say about the glory of Christ in human form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">First, what I found your book to be a great help in decoding for me is how older Christians like Augustine and Anselm speak of divine beauty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's always been some disconnect as I've read their works and a lot of works, medieval, even Edwards, talking about beauty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You mentioned the Greek origins of the concept of beauty as an influence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How does – how does that influence inform how we read the early church fathers when it comes to beauty?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and that's something that I'm – you know, there's a lot of work today in evangelical circles, evangelical and reformed circles on retrieving, efforts of retrieval, going back to the early sources and seeing what the church fathers and schoolmen had to say and trying to, you know, appropriate it anew.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, my work is not simply a work of retrieval, although it sort of is, in that I look at some of the prominent theologians and schoolmen in both the East and the Eastern Christianity, Western Christianity, and I do appropriate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I do appropriate some of the best of their insights and for – not just kind of like a magpie picking and choosing, you know, what I wanted, but I mean I tried to do it in a coherent, consistent way, showing that the beauty was fundamental to understanding reality itself, reality, the structure of reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, where this originally came from was the idea of what's called the transcendentals of being.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Being is the most general and comprehensive concept that we have to describe everything that exists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, the idea of a to be is a property common to all things that are – that really exist, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But to get to do more than simply talking about something as existing, the transcendental – you know, throughout the early patristic era and up through the medieval era, up to the Middle Ages, beauty in general or on the whole was considered a transcendental quality of being along with truth and goodness and oneness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this wasn't kind of a de novo, a brand new kind of conceptual framework.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's actually from the early Greek period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's what's called the triad, the transcendentals of, say, particularly, triad meaning the three of truth, goodness, and beauty were coming out of the writings of Plato and others in the early Greek period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What the church fathers did and theologians were kind of recognizing that they were onto something, that reality, that the transcendentals of truth, goodness, and beauty correspond – that corresponding to the good, the true, and the beautiful, they speak of reality being knowable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Reality in its right form being desirable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And reality in its best – its proper expression being – taking delight in it, causing a sense of delight to those that behold that reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in these terms, it's an ontological thing, not simply epistemological like where – like some method of knowing something, like just a methodology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's meanings to say that transcendentals of being get at the very ontology of reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And their insight was, yes, God created the heavens and the earth in such a way that it is in fact knowable, at least explorable and discoverable in a growing, developing kind of way, not that you know everything just by perceiving it all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that things – that there's a propriety to things, that something in its – what by its nature was meant to be is good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a goodness, an inherent goodness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that when things are in their order and their propriety as they were meant to be, it causes delight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In this sense, beauty is not just a discrete thing like, oh, isn't that sunset beautiful or isn't that vista of the meadow something beautiful to behold?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it was actually – I mean it literally is the metaphysics that they were working with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the point is – or their insight was the structure of reality we can address and talk about in these terms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the theologians in the early church focusing on beauty brought out the subjective nature of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they did it in different ways, but for instance, Anselm talked about the fittingness of God's plan of redemption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the fittingness of, say, how a tree was involved in the devil's temptation and how in the plan of God the devil is defeated by the Messiah being crucified on a tree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Anselm, getting this in large measure from the legacy of Augustine himself, you know, they paid attention to these symmetries, to these proportions, to the structure of the plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, sometimes their metaphysical assumptions drove them to overqualify something or overstate something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As an example, Anselm, following the previous lead of Augustine, I might add, said, well, those that God redeems are going to, you know, one for one, replace the fallen angels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because everything God does is perfectly symmetrical in such a way that there wouldn't be anything that was, well, we have too many of one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, they just kind of assumed, they took some of their aesthetic assumptions and drove them maybe a little bit too much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1058" target="_blank">00:17:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, we can, I think, be forgiving if something is over-presumed or something like that, at least flag it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1067" target="_blank">00:17:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But we don't have to throw the baby out with the bathwater.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we see in the very beginning of, again, going back to Genesis, the idea of the good, the true, and the beautiful, again, part of the created order.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1078" target="_blank">00:17:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this is in the context of Genesis 3, where in the event of the fall of Adam and Eve, but what I'm quoting here in Genesis 3, 6, precedes the event of the fall itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1089" target="_blank">00:18:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, according to verse 6 in chapter 3, "So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food," and there's the good, "and it was a delight to the eyes," there's the beautiful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise," there's the true, "she took of its fruit and ate."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I mean, so I think, you know, you can see these correspondences without forcing it, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the early, the patristics and the medieval theologians, that's what they saw.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1128" target="_blank">00:18:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They said, "Yeah, we can affirm some of these insights from, you know, our early, some of the Greek sages and see where they're consistent with the biblical story."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, the transcendentals as categories seem to be there from the very start of Genesis right there embedded in Genesis 3.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1151" target="_blank">00:19:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's good. Historically, I feel like I have a better grasp of these conversations in the early church, thanks to your book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, thank you. You know, your fundamental argument in the book is profoundly simple, that everything God does is beautiful in its God-glorifying nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything God does is beautiful in its God-glorifying nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1177" target="_blank">00:19:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We've talked about fittingness. Now expound on this, the God-centeredness of beauty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The God-centeredness of beauty has everything to do with starting with the objective beauty of the person of Christ, the beauty of the work of Christ,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1192" target="_blank">00:19:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which is traditionally called redemption accomplished, and the beauty of Christ's work ongoing through the Holy Spirit, traditionally called redemption applied.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1202" target="_blank">00:20:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, those three things are the preeminent aspects of how everything God does is beautiful in its God-glorifying nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I might add, all of this is in accord with the redemptive eschatological fulfillment of his original creational purposes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1219" target="_blank">00:20:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I start off with the doctrine of God. I discuss how the economical activities of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit reflect a proper fittingness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1228" target="_blank">00:20:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but more than a proper fittingness, a perfect fittingness in all of their outward works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1233" target="_blank">00:20:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What makes it perfect? What makes it perfect is because the fullness of God's glory is brought to consummative fulfillment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why it's a perfect fittingness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1247" target="_blank">00:20:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I use this phrase, the Christological contours of beauty, and that refers to how the outworking of God's eternal plan through the Son is what brings this consummative expression of fullness of God's glory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The one other point is how the beauty of our formation as Christian disciples involves Christians living out fittingly their identity in Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1276" target="_blank">00:21:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That participation of the imitatio Christi, of imitating Christ, of following him, of having this attitude in you, which was in Christ Jesus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1286" target="_blank">00:21:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and all these ways that the New Testament calls us to maturity in Christ, there's a fittingness of being conformed to his very nature, to his image.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's part of this God-centeredness, except it's from God-centeredness more focused to Christ-centeredness in this case, our spiritual transformation from the Father through the Son in the Spirit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.

You mentioned this earlier, but explain to us again what are you getting at when we talk about it like this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1343" target="_blank">00:22:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I really appreciate you selecting that particular quote. It was one that I kind of came to little by little.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1350" target="_blank">00:22:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What this has to do with is the theological aesthetic relation between beauty and God's beatitude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1356" target="_blank">00:22:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we can follow the line of argument for this particular, this theological aesthetic relation like this, in four points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1367" target="_blank">00:22:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Point one, the beatitude of God is the eternal condition in himself of absolute satisfaction and delight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1376" target="_blank">00:22:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's bound up with God's fullness of glory as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1382" target="_blank">00:23:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that's a traditional understanding of God's beatitude. This is not something that I'm kind of just coming up with myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1389" target="_blank">00:23:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We may not hear a lot about the attribute of God's beatitude, but it is traditional throughout church history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Point two is the outward beauty of God is expressed and perceivable as an aesthetic quality of his glory in his work of creation, redemption, and consummation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1410" target="_blank">00:23:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's important here to call attention to the distinctive characteristic of beauty, which is that beauty as beauty is not desired as a means to another end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the pleasure or delight associated with beholding the beautiful is its own end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Think ahead.

And we talk about God's beatitude. It is its own end. It's self-delight. He's self-satisfied.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1474" target="_blank">00:24:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Where I draw this all together is with the postulation that the beauty of God in his outward works, as it is perceived and experienced by human beings, is what most clearly betrays or points to that perfection of beatitude and sense of delight that belongs to God in himself as Father, Son, and Spirit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1495" target="_blank">00:24:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Amen. Beautiful. I love that. So, are you comfortable with the language of God as being the happiest being in the universe?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1504" target="_blank">00:25:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Good. Yeah, me too. And I think it's huge. I just wanted to state it. He wants to be seen and enjoyed and delighted in. You're a student of Jonathan Edwards. What does he add here to the conversation on understanding happiness and specifically how we enjoy God's beauty?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1523" target="_blank">00:25:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, the idea, in fact, the actual, in English, the use of the word happiness is specifically what Edward uses in terms of human beings sharing in, ultimately, and in our eternal state, God's happiness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1541" target="_blank">00:25:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, for Edwards, he affirms, of course, both the objective nature of God as well as the subjective dynamic of beauty. The objective aspect of God, he refers to as primary beauty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1554" target="_blank">00:25:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But for him, it's a function of, or in terms of this consent or conformity to God. So, for Edwards, primary beauty is not simply in regard to objects or things or the sunset or whatever. It's within the context of relationship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1575" target="_blank">00:26:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it presumes persons with volition and the capacity to love. And so that's the – so to the extent that our wills and our love and our affections are attuned and drawn into God, to that extent, we're participating in what Edwards calls primary beauty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1597" target="_blank">00:26:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But at the same time, he affirms the subjective dimension of primary beauty in terms of the delight or aesthetic pleasure that elicits when primary beauty is present or perceived.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1609" target="_blank">00:26:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he says that it's especially in the context of God's saving grace, salvificly, that human beings infused by the Holy Spirit are granted these spiritual affections, these religious affections that accord with the beauty and the delight of God's nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1630" target="_blank">00:27:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if our affections, if our religious – what he calls our religious affections accord with the delight in God's nature, we're participating in that delight. He says it this way. I'll do a short Edwards quote.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1642" target="_blank">00:27:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"The first effect of the power of God in the heart in regeneration is to give the heart a divine taste or sense to cause it to have a relish of the loveliness and sweetness of the supreme excellency of the divine nature."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1660" target="_blank">00:27:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, he's God the happiest person in the existence, and this is Edwards' way of saying yes, and that sense of the heart is how God draws us into that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1672" target="_blank">00:27:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Beautiful. Yeah, that relational connection is really important. I love the fittingness angle of your book as the objective basis of aesthetics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1682" target="_blank">00:28:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">At the start of the conversation, you mentioned beauty as something above and beyond utility and function. I can imagine one pushback, and it's one I've had myself, because it seems to me that in this age of technology, there's a certain functional fittingness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1699" target="_blank">00:28:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">At my desk right now, I see a USB port in the computer and a USB wire plugged into it. The fittingness is obvious. It was designed that way. I don't find it to be beautiful. The USB port, traditional USB port, is not beautiful to me in any way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1718" target="_blank">00:28:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Should I see beauty in the fittingness, or is there a fittingness that's just purely functional?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1725" target="_blank">00:28:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a good question, and there's no reason to oppose fittingness with functionality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1732" target="_blank">00:28:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. In fact, going back to the medieval perspective of it, something that was properly functional was by definition meant that there's a fittingness, a beauty to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1744" target="_blank">00:29:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But something can be simply functional, utilitarian, get something done, but lacks a certain aesthetic to it or has a low aesthetic, if we want to use that, or a low fittingness idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1760" target="_blank">00:29:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so fittingness is – it is a matter of degree. Things are not fitting in fullness, in complete, as much as they could possibly be, necessarily, or completely unfitting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1772" target="_blank">00:29:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So fittingness is – like beauty, there's degrees of that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1778" target="_blank">00:29:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for instance, I'm not trying to be a plug here for the Apple computer, but we know – I mean, it's well-known how Steve Jobs, when he was at the helm of Apple, he was insistent that their product development prioritized the aesthetics of their products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1801" target="_blank">00:30:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, he didn't have to do that, but I mean their computer or their iPod or whatever the case may be, iPads, they could have been just as functional but less aesthetically pleasing and rich.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1816" target="_blank">00:30:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But he made it a point to prioritize that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1819" target="_blank">00:30:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So to your little scenario about the different plugs and all this stuff, I think what we want to at least appreciate is that many times in our kind of boorish, kind of not valuing the aesthetic dynamics of the world, of life, of our life lived in the world, we settle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1839" target="_blank">00:30:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We settle for very things that are very unfitting, ill-fitting. I'll use that word. Very ill-fitting. They have low aesthetic expression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1849" target="_blank">00:30:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But that doesn't mean it needs to be the way – and there's things – if someone cared, they could, in fact, shape things, express things, form things so that their fittingness, their aesthetic expression becomes much more bold, much more apparent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think it really is a reflection of how we're – what we settle for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1870" target="_blank">00:31:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's good. We talked about Edwards and the divine sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1874" target="_blank">00:31:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the phenomenal points you make in your book is about the spectacular glory of Christ in human form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1880" target="_blank">00:31:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a theme I also see in Pastor John's book, A Peculiar Glory, chapter 11. As a Bible reader, I sometimes assume that moments like Christ's resurrection or his transfiguration are somehow extra beautiful and extra glorious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1899" target="_blank">00:31:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it's a glance at Christ's shining beauty sort of breaking free from behind the cloak of his bland humanity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1907" target="_blank">00:31:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You correct this. You write, "God's glory in Christ all during his earthly career is best appreciated not in an apophatic way, that is, as veiled by his humanity, but in a cataphatic way, that is, as revealed in and through his humanity."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1926" target="_blank">00:32:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So good. So we see the beauty of Christ not apophatically in what Christ isn't, but rather cataphatically in what Christ is and displays.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1937" target="_blank">00:32:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Explain this, if you've got to explain this, and how Bible readers see the glory of Christ in every verse of the Gospels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1944" target="_blank">00:32:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, this is one of those unanticipated insights that I got in the course of my research, in the course of my coming to understand beauty, the beauty of the person of Christ, specifically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1956" target="_blank">00:32:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I start off discussing how Christ is the image of God made visible in and expressed through the form of his humanity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1965" target="_blank">00:32:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As such, the beauty of Christ is inherent in and expressed through his human form.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1972" target="_blank">00:32:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, a common view, a common view throughout church history, and certainly in more modern contemporary times, a common view is that Christ's actual glory, we talk about the glory of Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1984" target="_blank">00:33:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, a common view is that his divine glory was hidden, was hidden or veiled beneath his humanity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=1992" target="_blank">00:33:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And Calvin is exhibit one guilty of this, talks about that Christ in a state of humiliation, his human form hiding his glory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=2003" target="_blank">00:33:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the idea being Christ's flesh, his human flesh acted like a reverse shield of sorts, you know, to prevent his real glory from being openly seen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=2014" target="_blank">00:33:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the problem with this is that if Christ's glory was actually concealed by his human form, then God, the son operated totally incognito as Jesus Christ in the form of a slave, as Paul puts it in Philippians 2, 7.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=2031" target="_blank">00:33:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because because his true identity as God, the son was in this view, what was was actually concealed by a veil of flesh.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=2041" target="_blank">00:34:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And a further problem is that it suggests, or part of the same problem, I should say, is that it suggests a competitive view between the relationship between the divinity of God and the humanity of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=2056" target="_blank">00:34:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're in tension, in uneasy tension with each other in this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=2061" target="_blank">00:34:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, instead, what I argue is that the humanity that Christ took on in the form of a slave, as Philippians 2 talks about, affirms that God's essential nature, you know, his glory is how I equate his essential nature is in fact revealed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=2080" target="_blank">00:34:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's revealed in the most transparent, self revelatory way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=2084" target="_blank">00:34:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so from an aesthetic angle, the idea of the form of things is so prominently important when you talk about the aesthetics of something, its form.</span></div><div class="c"><span

of Christ and is even in a state of humiliation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=2109" target="_blank">00:35:09.000</a></span> | <span

idea of what's, you know, theologically referred to as the Christ kenosis, his emptying of himself from the form of God into the form of a slave is throughout the whole rich passage of Philippians 2, 6, 6 through 8.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=2138" target="_blank">00:35:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not that he exchanged the form of God for the form of a slave, but that he manifested the form of God in the form of a slave.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

why is this important to Bible readers is so we can appreciate in the most robust way the the glory of God in Christ without without having without feeling like we have to kind of say, you know, there's just moments that he lets that glory out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=2171" target="_blank">00:36:11.000</a></span> |

life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGtaL9InOA&t=2836" target="_blank">00:47:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so our end, whatever beauty
