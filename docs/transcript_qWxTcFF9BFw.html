And the very big breakthrough is whether they know how to manage managers. As I started out as an individual contributor, I get trained on how to be a manager of individual contributors.</p><p>That makes me an engineering manager. And then if I get promoted to what they call engineering director, which is one level up, now I'm a director and now I'm managing a team of managers. Anybody who can make that jump now has a generalizable skill of being able to manage managers.</p><p>And then what makes that skill so great is that skill can scale, right? If you keep climbing that ladder, at some point you get promoted to CEO and then you have a team of managers who are the executives of the company, and then everything fans out from there. And so if you can manage managers, like at least in theory, you have the basic skill and temperament required to be able to scale all the way up.</p></div></div></body></html>
