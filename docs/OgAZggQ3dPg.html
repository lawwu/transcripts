Then he consented. So, here we are at the beginning of Jesus's public ministry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">John the Baptist has been preaching a message of repentance. John the Baptist, as you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">has come to prepare the way for the Messiah, and his message was just simple and clear and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">a very hard message. It was, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and so John's message was very simple. You all are sinners, and you need to repent. He preached</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">baptism of repentance, so he was calling sinners to repent and confess their sins. Then he would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">baptize them in the Jordan as a public demonstration of their contrition. What a person was saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">when they were baptized by John in the Jordan was essentially, "I'm a sinner, and I need forgiveness,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and I need repentance." They were confessing their sins as they were being baptized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">by John. So, John had this very hard message, "Repent." He had no patience for the religious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of virtuosity, this exterior religion that was practiced in Israel in that day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">He even preached to the Pharisees, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">wrath that is to come?" He went to the religious leaders of his day, and he basically called them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">"You bunch of snakes, you need to repent, and you need to bear fruit in keeping with repentance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't just tell me that you're repentant. Show in your actual life that you have turned from your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">sin and turned to the Lord." So, John was just preaching this hard message. And so, it was just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a very simple picture of being baptized by John. You were saying, "I am a sinner, and I need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to repent." And so, here is this amazing scene in Matthew 3 verse 13 as the context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">where it says that Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That's really just a stunning scene. Why is that? You remember that John knew who Jesus was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that Jesus was the Lamb of God who came to take away the sin of the world. Jesus was the Messiah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and John the Baptist knew all of that. And yet, here comes Jesus who needs no repentance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and he wants to be baptized by John. And John's looking at this, and it says in verse 14,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">"John would have prevented him." And you know why. John understood, "Jesus, you're not a sinner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You're the Lamb of God who's come to take away the sin of the world. You're the Messiah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You're the light. You don't need to stand in the place of a sinner." And he wanted to stop Jesus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">from being baptized. And then to carry the thought even further, he was protesting not only that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus would stand in the place of a sinner, but he was protesting that he would be standing in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the place of a righteous man baptizing Jesus. And verse 14, John's basically saying, "The roles are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">reversed here. I need to be baptized by you. I'm the sinner, Jesus. I need to be in the place of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sinners. You're the righteous man. You need to be in the place of a righteous man. We have our roles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">reversed." He says, "Do you come to me?" And Jesus answered him, "Let it be so now, for thus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he consented. Now, there's been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">pages and pages of reflection on this simple scene of why was Jesus baptized and what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the significance of all of that.

And my devotional thought is simply this, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus began his earthly ministry the same way he ended it, and that is he stood in the place of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a sinner even though he had no sin. That was why Jesus came. He came to be a substitute for sin</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and to stand in the sinner's place. And what results from Jesus standing in the sinner's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">place is that you have this role reversal, which is seen in, you know, the theme is already here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to come to full crescendo and climax at the end of the gospel records, but you begin to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">see the theme here of because Jesus says, "I'm going to stand in the place of a sinner," then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgAZggQ3dPg&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">John is saying, "Why are the roles reversed?
