if that child's off to school, then you have a tendency to wonder, how's it going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAVUH4qbT6M&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">with the input that's coming from the teacher?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

that, and then there's this adjustment to the last child entering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAVUH4qbT6M&t=143"

quieter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAVUH4qbT6M&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">because they usually have their

a lot of Christian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAVUH4qbT6M&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">families do this,
