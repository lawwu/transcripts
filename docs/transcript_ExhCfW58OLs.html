I appreciate these this comes from Diane She says This is not a new question Just a follow-up on a question I sent before my question at the time Was about the fact that i'm a writer who works at home and seem to be able Uh to consistently do whatever I wanted first thing in the morning, but then having trouble Ever moving on to the second thing I want to do due to the distractions of being at home while I worked well update Since then I think i've solved the problem by renting a small office near my home Now i'm exercising first thing and then I go into the office just like a normal pre-covid working person and get my writing done So it's up to you whether you choose to use my question or not But I feel like i've solved it myself and I feel good about that. So thank you for all your work Great case study diane Work from near home w f n h. I think it's a very important trend. I've written about this in the new yorker Diane is a exemplar. There are lots of things we freely spend money on Without even really thinking about it, but for some reason we have this resistance about I don't want to spend money On a workspace if i'm a remote worker If I don't have to go to an office I don't want to spend money on a workspace near my home because technically You don't need it You have a home office sure But the difference in experience about having a place to go versus not is worth quite a bit So let's say there's a quick thought example building on this case study let's say You had a traditional office job You live in a relatively expensive place. You live in suburban, washington dc All right. So in this thought experiment you live in kensington Relatively expensive house. All right You go permanently remote So you have a home office and your house in kensington But your dogs are there and and your kids come home from school and whatever right like it's it's distracting Your laundry is there the tv is always playing and you find yourself really distracted If you could have a office to go to near your house Your productivity happiness sustainability of your work might be much better. Now, let's say you're spending all your money kensington's expensive Well now that you're really remote You move out of kensington You move for whatever reason you've always had this dream of having land. So you move to a farm in westminster My local listeners know who i'm talking about here, this is actually a real person we know who's doing this And you have some land and a barn and and and you know, it's cheaper to live there and Then you can you go and rent a little bit of office space in the the nearby downtown And it's still cheaper than where you live before you kind of live in this cool place and you have this land and it's cheaper To live so you can spend some of that money you save into an office That's what you should do because you know what if you go to that office to work that works going to be much more effective You'll have much clearer separation between work and home. What a great investment in your money So what i'm trying to say here is what diane did is great If it is all possible to find a way to invest money in a dedicated working space That's not your house, but convenient to your house Do it And I think maybe we should see more of this If i'm remote I'm gonna move somewhere cheaper Reclaim 50 of that savings invested in a place to work</p></div></div></body></html>
