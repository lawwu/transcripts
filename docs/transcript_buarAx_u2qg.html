And what people really think is an incredibly important fact to know. So every time you're actually saying, you can't say that, you're actually depriving yourself of the knowledge of what people really think. You're causing what Timur Karan, who's on our board of advisors, calls preference falsification. You end up with an inaccurate picture of the world, which by the way, in a lot of cases, because there are activists who want to restrict more speech, they actually tend to think that people are more prejudiced than they might be. And actually one very real practical way it makes things worse is when you censor people, it doesn't change their opinion. It just encourages them to not share it with people who will get them in trouble. So it leads them to talk to people who they already agree with and group polarization takes off. The following is a conversation with Greg Lukianoff, free speech advocate, First Amendment attorney, president and CEO of FIRE, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. And he's the author of Unleashing Liberty, co-author with Jonathan Haidt of Coddling of the American Mind, and co-author with Ricky Schlott of a new book coming out in October that you should definitely pre-order now called The Canceling of the American Mind. Which is a definitive accounting of the history, present and future of cancel culture, a term used and overused in public discourse, but rarely studied and understood with the depth and rigor that Greg and Ricky do in this book and in part in this conversation. Freedom of speech is important, especially on college campuses, the very place that should serve as the battleground of ideas, including weird and controversial ones. That should encourage bold risk taking, not conformity. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Greg Lukianoff. Let's start with the big question. What is cancel culture? Now you've said that you don't like the term as it's been, quote, "dragged through the mud and abused endlessly by a whole host of controversial figures." Nevertheless, we have the term. What is it? Cancel culture is the uptick of campaigns, especially successful campaigns, starting around 2014 to get people fired, expelled, deplatformed, et cetera, for speech that would normally be protected by the First Amendment. And I say would be protected because we're talking about circumstances in which it isn't necessarily where the First Amendment applies. But what I mean is like as an analog to, say, things you couldn't lose your job as a public employee for. And also the climate of fear that's resulted from that phenomenon, the fact that you can lose your job for having the wrong opinion. And it wasn't subtle that there was an uptick in this, particularly on campus around 2014. John Ronson wrote a book called So You've Been Publicly Shamed. It came out in 2015, already documenting this phenomenon. I wrote a book called Freedom From Speech in 2014. But it really was in 2017 when you started seeing this be directed at professors. And when it comes to the public, it's not just the public. It's the whole community. And it comes to the number of professors that we've seen, you know, be targeted and lose their jobs. I've been doing this for 22 years, and I've seen nothing like it. So there's so many things I want to ask you here. But one actually, just look at the organization of FIRE. Can you explain what the organization is? Because it's interconnected to this whole fight and the rise of cancel culture and the fight for freedom of speech since 2014 and before. So FIRE was founded in 1999 by Harvey Sloverglate. He is a famous civil liberties attorney. He's a bit on the show. He's the person who actually found me out in my very happy life out in San Francisco, but knew I was looking for a First Amendment job. I'd gone to law school specifically to do First Amendment. And he found me, which was pretty cool. His protege, Kathleen Sullivan, was the dean of Stanford Law School. And this remains the best compliment I ever got in my life is that she recommended me to Harvey. And since that's the whole reason why I went to law school, I was excited to be a part of this new organization. The other co-founder of FIRE is Alan Charles Kors. He's just an absolute genius. He is one of the leading experts in the world on the Enlightenment and particularly about Voltaire. And if any of your listeners do like the great courses, he has a lecture on Blaise Pascal. And Blaise, of course, is famous for the Pascal's Wager. And I left it just so moved and impressed. I was like, "Oh, that's great. I'm impressed." And with a depth of understanding of how important this person was. That's interesting. You mentioned to me offline, connected to this, that there is a... At least it runs in parallel, or there's a connection between the love of science and the love of the freedom of speech. Yes. Can you maybe elaborate where that connection is? Sure. I think that for those of us who are really... Who've devoted our lives to freedom of speech, one thing that we are into, whether we know it or not... Is epistemology. The study and philosophy of knowledge. Freedom of speech has lots of moral and philosophical dimensions. But from a pragmatic standpoint, it is necessary because we're creatures of incredibly limited knowledge. We are incredibly self-deceiving. I always love the fact that Yuval Harari refers to the Enlightenment as the discovery of ignorance. Because that's exactly what it was. It was suddenly being like, "Wow. Hold on a second. All this incredibly interesting folk wisdom we got, which by the way, can be surprisingly reliable here and there. When you start testing a lot of it, it's nonsense. It doesn't hold up. Even our ideas about the way things fall, as Galileo established, even our intuitions, they're just wrong. A lot of the early history of freedom of speech, it was happening at the same time as the scientific revolution. So a lot of the early debates about freedom of speech were tied in. So certainly Galileo... I always point out like Kepler was probably like the even more radical idea that there weren't even perfect spheres. But at the same time, largely because of the invention of the printing press, you also had all these political developments. And I always talk about Jan Hus from the famous Czech hero who was a... Who was burned at the stake, and I think in 1419. But he was basically Luther before the printing press. Before Luther could get his word out, he didn't stand a chance. And that was exactly what Jan Hus was. But a century later, thanks to the printing press, everyone could know what Luther thought, and boy, did they. But it led to, of course, this completely crazy, hyper-disrupted period in European history. Well, you mentioned... To jump around a little bit. The First Amendment. First of all, what is the First Amendment? And what is the connection to you between the First Amendment, the freedom of speech, and cancel culture? Sure. So I'm a First Amendment lawyer, as I mentioned. And that's what I... That's my passion. That's what I studied. And I think American First Amendment law is incredibly interesting. In one sentence, the First Amendment is trying to get rid of basically all the reasons why humankind had been killing each other for its entire existence, that we weren't going to fight anymore over... Over opinion. We weren't going to fight anymore over religion, that you have the right to approach your government for redress of grievances, that you have the freedom to associate, that all of these things in one sentence were like, "Nope. The government will no longer interfere with your right to have these fundamental human rights." And so one thing that makes FIRE a little different from other organizations is, however, we're not just a First Amendment organization. We are a free speech organization. And so... But at the same time, a lot of what I think free speech is can be well explained with reference to a lot of First Amendment law, partially because in American history, some of our smartest people have been thinking about what the parameters of freedom of speech are in relationship to the First Amendment. And a lot of those principles, they transfer very well just as pragmatic ideas. So like the biggest sin in terms of censorship is called viewpoint discrimination. That essentially you allow freedom of speech except for that opinion. Now it's... And it's found to be kind of more defensible. And I think this makes sense that if you set up a forum and like, "We're only going to talk about economics to exclude people who want to talk about a different topic." But it's considered rightfully a bigger deal if you set up a forum for economics, but we're not going to let people talk about that kind of economics or have that opinion on economics, most particularly. So a lot of the principles from First Amendment... First Amendment law actually make a lot of philosophical sense as good principles for when, like what is protected and unprotected speech, what should get you in trouble, how you actually analyze it, which is why we actually try in our definition of cancel culture to work in some of the First Amendment norms just in the definition. So we don't have to bog down on them as well. You're saying so many interesting things, but if you can linger on the viewpoint discrimination, is there any gray area of discussion there? Like what is and isn't economics for the example you gave? Yeah. Is there... I mean, is it a science or is it an art to draw lines of what is and isn't allowed? Yeah. If you're saying that something is or is not economics, well, you can say everything's economics and therefore I want to talk about poetry. There'd be some line drawing exercise in there. But let's say at once you decide to open up to poetry even, it's a big difference between saying, "Okay, now we're open to poetry, but you can't say Dante was bad." That's a forbidden opinion now officially in this otherwise open forum. That would immediately at an intuitive level strike people as a bigger problem than just saying that poetry isn't economics. Yeah. I mean, that intuitive level that you speak to, I hope that all of us have that kind of basic intuition when the line is crossed. It's the same thing for pornography. Yes. When you see it. I think there's the same level of intuition. There's the same level of intuition that should be applied across the board here. It's when that intuition becomes deformed by whatever forces of society, that's when it starts to feel like censorship. Yeah. I mean, people find it a different thing. If someone loses their job simply for their political opinion, even if that employer has every right in the world to fire you, I think Americans should still be like, "Well, it's true. They have every right in the world and I'm not making a legal case that maybe you shouldn't fire someone for their political opinion." But think that through. What kind of society do we want to live in? It's been funny watching—I point this out. Yes, I will defend businesses' First Amendment rights of association to be able to have the legal right to decide who works for them. But from a moral or philosophical matter, if you think through the implications of if every business in America becomes an expressive association in addition to being a profit-maximizing organization, that would be a disaster for democracy because you would end up in a situation where people would actually be saying to themselves, "I don't think I can actually say what I really think and still believe I can keep my job." And that's where I was worried. I felt like we were headed because a lot of the initial response to people getting canceled was very simply, "Oh, but they have the right to get rid of this person." And that's the beginning and end of the discussion. And I thought that was— I thought that was a dodge. I thought that wasn't actually a very serious way of—that if you care about both the First Amendment and freedom of speech, of thinking it through. So to you, just to clarify, the First Amendment is kind of a legal embodiment of the ideal of freedom of speech. And then freedom of speech— That's applied to government. And it's very specific. It applied to government. And freedom of speech is the application of the principle to everything, including the level philosophical ideal of what it—of the value of people being able to speak their mind. Yeah. It's an older, bolder, more expansive idea. And you can have a situation—and I talk about countries that have good free speech law but not necessarily great free speech culture. And I talk about how when we sometimes make this distinction between free speech law and free speech culture, we're thinking in a very cloudy kind of way. And what I mean by that is that law is generally—particularly in a common law country, it's the reflection of norms. Those judges are people too. And in a lot of cases, common law is supposed to actually take our intuitive ideas of fairness and place them into the law. So if you actually have a culture that doesn't appreciate free speech from a philosophical standpoint, it's not going to be able to protect free speech for the long haul, even in the law, because eventually—that's one of the reasons why I worry so much about some of these terrible cases coming up. I'm not going to be able to protect free speech from a philosophical standpoint, because I'm not going to be able to protect free speech from a philosophical standpoint, because I'm not going to be able to protect free speech from a philosophical standpoint, because I fear that even though, sure, American First Amendment law is very strongly protective of First Amendment, for now, it's not going to stay that way if you have generations of law students graduating who actually think there's nothing—there's no higher goal than shouting down your opponent. Yeah, so that's why so much of your focus—or a large fraction of your focus—is on the higher education or education period, is because education is the— Yeah, yeah. —is the foundation of culture. Yeah. You have this history, you know. '64, you have the free speech movement on Berkeley, and in '65, you have repressive tolerance by Herbert Marcuse, which was a declaration of, "By the way, we on the left, we shouldn't—we should have free speech, but we should have free speech for us." I mean, I went back and reread repressive tolerance and how clear it is. I forgot—I had forgotten that it really is kind of like—and these so-called liberal conservatives and right-wingers, we need to repress them because they're regressive thinkers. It really doesn't come out to anything more sophisticated than the very old idea that our people are good. They get free speech. They should keep it. Other side, bad. We should not have—and we have to retrain society. And of course, like, it ends up being another—and he was also a fan of Mao, so it's not surprising that he—of course, the system would have to rely on some kind of totalitarian system. But that was a laughable position, you know, say, 30, 40 years ago. The idea that essentially, you know, free speech for me, not for thee, as the great, you know, free speech champion, Ned Hentoff, used to say, was something that you were supposed to be embarrassed by. But I saw this when I was in law school in '97. I saw this when I was interning at the ACLU in '99, that there was a slow-motion transition. There was a slow-motion train wreck coming. That essentially, there was these bad ideas from campus that had been taking on more and more steam of basically no free speech for my opponent were actually becoming more and more accepted as—and partially because academia was becoming less and less viewpoint diverse. I think that, as my co-author Jonathan Haidt points out, that when you have low viewpoint diversity, people start thinking in a very kind of tribal way, and if you don't have the respected dissenters— You don't have the people that you can point to that are like, "Hey, this is a smart person. This is a smart, reasonable, decent person that I disagree with, so I guess not everyone thinks alike on this issue." You start getting much more kind of like only, you know, only bad people, only heretics, only blasphemers, only right-wingers, you know, can actually think in this way. Every time you say something, I always have a million thoughts and a million questions that pop up, but since you mentioned there's a kind of drift, as you write about, and I read about in the book, and you mentioned now there's a drift towards the left in academia, we should also maybe draw a distinction here between the left and the right and the cancel culture as you present in your book. Sure. It's not necessarily associated with any one political viewpoint, that there's mechanisms on both sides that result in cancellation and censorship in violation of freedom of speech. So one thing I want to be really clear about is the book takes on both right and left cancel culture. They're different in a lot of ways. And definitely, you know, cancel culture from the left is more important in academia, where the left dominates. But we talk a lot about cancel culture coming from legislatures. We talk a lot about cancel culture on campus as well, because even though most of the attempts that come from on campus to get people canceled are still from the left, there are a lot of attacks that come from the right, that come from attempts by different organizations and sometimes when they're on campus. There are stories in Fox News, you know, like they'll go after professors. And about one third of the attempts to get professors punished that are successful actually do come from the right. And we talk about attempts to get books banned in the book. We talk about suing the Florida legislature. Ron DeSantis had something called the Stop WOKE Act, which we told everyone. This is laughably unconstitutional. They tried to ban, you know, a particular topic. They tried to ban a particular topic. They tried to ban a particular topic. They tried to ban a particular topic. And we're like, no, this is a joke. Like, this will be laughed out of court. And they didn't listen to us, and they brought it, they passed it, and we sued, and we won. Now they're trying again with something that's equally as unconstitutional, and we will sue again, and we will win. Can you elaborate on the Stop WOKE Act? So this is presumably trying to limit certain topics from being taught in school? Yeah. Basically, woke topics. You know, it's more – it came out of the school. The sort of attempt to get at critical race theory. So it's topics related to race, gender, et cetera. I don't remember exactly how they tried to cabinet to CRT. But when you actually – the law is really well established that you can't tell higher education what they're allowed to teach without violating the First Amendment. And when this got in front of a judge, it was exactly as – he was exactly as skeptical of it as we thought it was. I think he called this dystopian. And it wasn't a close call. So if you're against that kind of teaching, the right way to fight it is by making the case that it's not a good idea as part of the curriculum as opposed to banning it from the curriculum? Yeah. It just – the state doesn't have the power to simply say – to ban, you know, what professors in higher education teach. Now it gets a little more complicated when you talk about K-12 because the state has a role in deciding what public K-12 is. And I think that's a really important thing.

I think that's a really important thing. I think that's a really important thing. I think that there are plenty of things we know about human nature and we know about dumb things people say, and we've made it into an environment where there's just someone out there waiting to be kind of like, "Oh, remember that dumb thing you said we were 14? Well, I'm going to make sure that you don't get into your dream school because of that." That's offense archaeology. That's not my term, though. It's a great term. It's a great term. We steal from the best. "Digging through someone's past comments to find a speech that hasn't aged well." And that's a really important thing. And that one's tactical. That one isn't just someone not being empathetic. They're like, "I'm going to punish you for this." And that's one of the reasons why I got depressed writing this book, because there's already people who don't love me because of Coddling in the American Mind, usually based on a misunderstanding of what we actually said in Coddling in the American Mind, but nonetheless. But on this one, I'm calling out people for being very cruel in a lot of cases. But one thing that was really scary about... Studying a lot of these cases is that once you have that target on your back, what they're going to try to cancel you for could be anything. They might go back into your old boats, find something that you said in 1995, do something where essentially it looks like it's this entire other thing, but really what's going on is they didn't like your opinion, they didn't like your point of view on something, and they're going to find a way that from now on, anytime your name comes up, it's like, "Oh, remember this? This thing I didn't like about him? I didn't like about him." And it's, again, it's cruel. It doesn't get you anywhere closer to the truth, but it is a little scary to stick your neck out. - Okay, in terms of solutions, I'm going to ask you a few things. So one, parenting. - Yeah, five and seven-year-old. - So I'm sure you've figured it all out then. - Oh, God, no. - From a free speech perspective. - Yeah. - From a free speech culture perspective, how to be a good parent. - Yeah. I think the first quality... - Yeah. - You should be cultivating in your children, if you want to have a free speech culture, is curiosity and an awareness of the vastness that will always be unknown. And getting my kids excited about the idea that's like, we're going to spend our whole lives learning about stuff. And it's fast and exciting and endless, and we'll never make a big dent in it, but the journey will be amazing. But only fools think they can. And I think they know everything. And sometimes dangerous fools at that. So giving the sense of intellectual humility early on. Being also, you know, saying things that actually do sound kind of old fashioned. Like, but I say things to my kids like, listen, if you enjoy study and work, both things that I very much enjoy, I do for fun, your life is going to feel great and it's going to feel easy. So some of, you know, some of those old fashioned virtues are fine. But I also try to teach them the virtues of things I try to preach. Counterintuitive stuff like outdoor time, playing, having time that are not intermediated experiences is really important. And little things like I talk about in the book about when my kids are watching something that's scary. And I'm not talking about like zombie movies, you know, I'm talking about like a cartoon that has kind of a scary moment. And saying that they want to turn the TV off. And I talk to them. And I say, listen, I'm going to sit next to you and we're going to finish this show. And I want you to tell me what you think of this afterwards. And I sat next to my sons. And by the end of it, every single time, you know, when I asked them, was that as scary as you thought it was going to be? And they're always like, no, daddy, that was fine. And I'm like, that's one of the great lessons in life. The fear that you don't go through becomes much bigger in your head than actually simply facing it. That's one of the reasons why I'm fighting back against this culture. I love, you know, for all of our kids to be able to grow up in an environment where people give you grace. And, you know, accept the fact that sometimes people are going to say things that piss you off. Take seriously the possibility of being wrong. And be curious. Well, I have hope that the thing you mentioned, which is because so much of young people's stuff is on the internet, that they're going to give each other a break. Because then everybody is cancel-worthy. Generation Z hates cancel culture. And that's another reason why it's like people still claiming this is even happening. It's kind of like, no, you actually can ask, you know, kids what they think of cancel culture. And they hate it. Yeah. Well, I kind of think of them as like the immune system that's like, that's the culture waking up to like, no, this is not a good thing. I am glad, though. I mean, I am one of those kids who, you know, is really glad that I was a little kid in the 80s and a teenager in the 90s. Because having everything potentially online, it's not a good thing. It's not an upbringing I envy. Well, I, because you can also do the absolute free speech. I like leaning into it. Yeah. Where I hope for a future where a lot of our insecurities, flaws, everything is out there. Yeah. And to be raw honest with it, I think that leads to a better world. Because the flaws are beautiful. I mean, that's the flaws is the basic ingredients. The basic ingredients of human connection. Robert Wright, he wrote a book on Buddhism. And I talked about trying to use social media from a Buddhist perspective. And like as if it's the collective unconscious meditating. And seeing those little like angry bits that are trying to cancel you or get you to shut up. And just kind of like letting them go the same way you're supposed to watch your thoughts kind of trail off. I would love to see that like visualized. Whatever the drama going on, just seeing the sea of it, of the collective consciousness just processing this and having a little like panic attack. And just kind of like reading it in. Looking at the little sort of hateful angry voices kind of pop up and be like, okay, there you are. And I'm still focused on that thing. Because that is one of the things is, okay, yeah, actually this is probably late in the game to be giving my grand theory on this stuff. But. Never too late. So, what I was studying in law school when I ran out of First Amendment classes, I decided to study censorship during the Tudor dynasty. Because that's where we get our ideas of prior restraint that come from the licensing of the printing press. Which was something that Henry VIII was the first to do. Where basically the idea was that if you can't print anything in England unless it's with these, your majesty approving, you know, the laws of the kingdom. Your majesty approved printers. It will prevent heretical work and anti-Henry VIII stuff from coming out. Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty efficient idea if nothing else. And I always, so he started getting angry at the printing press around 1521. And then passed something that required prints to be, along with parliament in 1538. And I always think of that as kind of like where we are now. Because we have this, we had the, back then we had the original disruptive technology. You know, writing was probably really bad. But the next one, which was the printing press, which was absolutely calamitous. And I mean, and I say calamitous on purpose. Because in the short term, the witch hunts went up like crazy. Because the printing press allowed you to get that manual on how to find witches. That the religious wars went crazy. It led to all sorts of distress, misinformation, nastiness. And Henry VIII was trying to put the genie back in the bottle. You know, he was kind of like, I can, I want to use this for good. Like I feel like it could be used. But he was in an unavoidable period of epistemic anarchy. There's nothing you can do to make the period after the printing press came out to be a non-disruptive, non-crazy period. Other than like absolute totalitarianism and destroy all the print presses. Which simply was not possible. And that's why the printing press was not possible in Europe. So I feel like that's kind of like where we are now. That disruption came from adding, I think, you know, several million people to the European conversation. And then eventually the global conversation. But eventually it became the best tool for disconfirmation, for getting rid of falsity, for spotting bad ideas. And it's the benefits, the long-term benefits of the printing press are incalculably great. And that's what gives me some optimism for where we are now with social media. Because we are in that unavoidably anarchical period. And I do worry that there are attempts in states to pass things to try to put the genie back in the bottle. Like if we ban TikTok or we say that nobody under 18 can be on the internet unless they have parental permission. We're going at something that no amount of sort of top-down is going to be able to fix. We have to culturally adapt to the fact of it in ways that make us wiser. That actually and allow it potentially to be that wonderful engine for disconfirmation that we're nowhere near yet, by the way. But think about it. Additional millions of eyes on problems, thanks to the printing press, helped create the scientific revolution, the enlightenment, the discovery of ignorance. We now have added billions of eyes and voices to solving problems. And we're just, we're using them for cat videos and canceling. But those are just the early days of the printing press. Exactly. It all starts with the cats and the canceling. Is there something about X, about Twitter, which is perhaps the most energetic source of cats and canceling? It seems like the collective unconscious of the species. I mean, like, it's one of these things where the genie is the only thing that's going to be able to do anything. It's one of these things where the tendency to want to see patterns in history sometimes can limit the actual batshit crazy experience of what history actually is. Because, yes, we have these nice comforting ideas that it's going to be like last time. We don't know. It hasn't happened yet. And I think how unusual Twitter is. Because I think of it as like the... Because people talk about, you know, writing and... Mass communications and as being expanding the size of our collective brain. But now we're kind of looking at our collective brain in real time. And it's filled just like our own brains with all sorts of like little crazy things that pop up and appear like virtual particles kind of all over the place of people, you know, reacting in real time to things. There's never been anything even vaguely like it. And it can be, at its worst, awful to see. At its best, sometimes seeing people like just getting euphoric over something going on and cracking absolutely brilliant immediate jokes, you know, at the same time. It can be... It can even be a joyful experience. I feel like... And I live in a neighborhood now on X where I mostly deal with people that I think are actually thoughtful even if I disagree with them. And it's not such a bad experience. I occasionally run into those other sort of what I call neighborhoods on X where it's just all canceling, all nastiness, and it's always kind of an unpleasant visit to those places. I'm not saying the whole thing needs to be like my experience. But I do think that the reason why people keep on coming back to it is it reveals raw aspects of humanity that sometimes we prefer to pretend don't exist. Yeah. But also it's totally new, like you said. Yeah. It's just the virality, the speed that news travels. The opinions travel. That the battle over ideas travels. The battle over information too. Yeah. Of what is true and not. Lies travel. The old Mark Twain thing pretty fast on the thing. Yeah. And it changes your understanding of how to interpret information. It can also stress you out to no end. Remember to get off it sometimes. The stats are pretty bad on mental health with young people. And I'm definitely in the camp of people who think that social media is part of that. I understand, you know, the debate. But I'm pretty persuaded that one of the things that is hasn't been great for mental health of people is just constantly being exposed. Yeah, absolutely. I think it's possible to create social media that makes a huge amount of money, makes people happy. To me, like it's possible to align the incentives. So in terms of, yeah, making teenagers, making every stage of life, giving you long-term fulfillment and happiness with your physical existence outside of your home. Yeah. And on social media, helping you grow as a human being, helping challenge you just in the right amount and just the right amount of cat videos, whatever gives this full rich human experience. I think it's just a machine learning problem. It's like, it's not easy. Interesting. To create a feed. So the easiest feed you could do is like maximize engagement. Yeah. But that's just like a really dumb algorithm. Yeah. It's like for the algorithm to learn enough about you, you have to have a really dumb algorithm. Yeah. To understand what will make you truly happy as a human being to grow long-term. That's just a very difficult problem to solve. You ever watch Fleabag? It's absolutely brilliant British show. And it sets you up. One of the reasons why like people love it so much is it sets you up that you're watching like a raunchy British sex in the house show. Yeah. Except the main character is the most promiscuous one. It's like, okay. And you kind of roll your eyes a little bit. It's kind of funny and it's kind of cute and kind of spicy. And then you realize that the person is actually kind of suffering and having a hard time and it gets deeper and deeper into the story. And it's like, okay, I'm not going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. Okay. Yeah. And then you realize that the person is actually kind of suffering and having a hard time and it gets deeper and deeper into the story. Yeah. And then you realize that the person is actually kind of suffering and having a hard time and it gets deeper and deeper into the story. Yeah. It's like, okay. And you kind of roll your eyes a little bit. It's kind of funny and it's kind of cute and kind of spicy. And then you realize that the person is actually kind of suffering and having a hard time. And it gets deeper and deeper as the show goes on. And she will do these incredible speeches about, tell me what to do. Like, I know there's experts out there. I know there's knowledge out there. I know there's an optimal way to live my life. So why can't someone just tell me what to do? And it's this wonderfully accurate, I think, aspect of human desire that what if something could actually tell me the optimal way to go? Because I think there is a desire to give up some amount of your own freedom and discretion in order to be told to do the optimally right thing. But that path scares me to death. Yeah. But see, the way you phrased it, that scares me too. So there's several things. One, you could be constantly distracted in a TikTok way by things that keep you engaged. Yeah. So removing that and giving you a bunch of options constantly and learning from long-term what results in your actual long-term happiness. So like, which amounts of challenging ideas are good for you? For somebody like me, exactly. Just four. But there is a number like that for you, Greg. That's a lot. For me, that number is pretty high. I love debate. I love the feeling of realizing, holy shit, I've been wrong. Yes. But I would love for the algorithm to know that about me and to help me, but always giving me options if I want to descend into cat videos and so on. Well, the educational aspect of it. Yes, educational, yes. The idea of both going the speed that you need to and running as fast as you can. Yeah. I mean, there's the whole flow thing. I just feel YouTube recommendation, for better or worse, if used correctly, it feels like it does a pretty good job. Whenever I just refuse to click on stuff that's just dopamine-based and click on only educational things, the recommendation it provides are really damn good. So I feel like it's a solvable problem, at least in the space of education, of challenging yourself, but also expanding your realm of knowledge and all this kind of stuff. And I'm definitely more in the, we're in an inescapable inner. I think we're in a hierarchical period and require big cultural adjustments, and there's no way that this isn't going to be a difficult transition. Is there any specific little or big things that you'd like to see X do, Twitter do? I have lots of thoughts on that. With the printing press, an extra millions of eyes on any problem can tear down any institution, any person, or any idea. And that's good in some ways because a lot of medieval institutions needed to be torn down, and some people did too, and a lot of ideas needed to be torn down. Same thing is true. An extra billions of eyes on every problem can tear down any person, idea, or institution. And again, some of those things needed to be torn down, but it can't build yet. We are not at the stage that it can build yet, but it has shown us how thin our knowledge was. It's one of the reasons why we're also aware of the replication crisis. It's one of the reasons why we're also aware of how kind of shoddy our research is, how much our expert class is arrogant in many cases, but people don't want to live in a world where they don't have people.

But again, much better than, the world, I believe, is much better because Wikipedia exists. But now that we're in these adolescent stages, we're growing and trying to come up with different technologies. The idea of a stream is really, really interesting. As you get more and more people into this, this discourse that where the value is, let's try to get the truth. - Yeah. Yeah, and that basically, you know, you get the little cards for, nope, wrong, nope, wrong. - And the different rhetorical techniques that are being used to avoid actually discussing. - Yeah, and I think actually you can make it a little bit fun by you get a limited number of them. You know, it's kind of like, you get three what about-ism cards. - It's a gamifying the whole thing, absolutely. - Yeah. - Let me ask you about, so you mentioned going through some difficult moments in your life. - Sure. - What has been your experience with depression? What has been your experience getting out of it, overcoming it? - Yeah, I mean, the whole thing, the whole journey with Coddling the American Mind began with me in the Belmont Psychiatric Facility in Philadelphia back in 2007. I had called 911 in a moment of clarity because I'd gone to the hardware store to, you know, make sure that when I killed myself that I, it stuck. I wanted to make sure that I, you know, had my head wrapped and everything. So like if all the drugs I was planning to take didn't work, that I wouldn't be able to, you know, claw my way out. It'd been a really rough year. And I always had issues with depression, but they were getting worse. And frankly, one of the reasons why this cancel culture stuff is so important to me is that the thing that I didn't emphasize as much in Coddling the American Mind, which by the way, that description that I give of trying to kill myself was the first time I'd ever written it down. Nobody in my family was aware of how, of it being like that. My wife had never seen it. And basically the only way I was able to write that was by, by doing, you know how you can kind of trick yourself if, and I was like, I'm going to convince myself that this is just between me and my computer and nobody will see it. It's probably now the most public thing I've ever written. But what I didn't emphasize in that was how much the culture played into how depressed I got because I was originally the legal director of FIRE, then I became president of FIRE in 2005, moved to Philadelphia where I get depressed. And it's just, I don't have family there. There's something about the town. They don't seem to like me very much. But the main thing was being in the culture war all the time. There was a girl that I was dating. I remember, you know, she didn't seem to really approve of what I did. And a lot of people didn't really seem to. And meanwhile, like I was defending people on the left all the time. And they'd be like, oh, that's good that you're defending someone on the left, but they still would never forgive me for defending someone on the right. And I remember saying at one point, I'm like, listen, I'm like, I'm a true believer in this stuff. I'm willing to defend Nazis. I'm certainly willing to defend Republicans. And she actually said, I think Republicans might be worse. And that didn't, that relationship didn't go very well. And then I nearly got in fist fights a couple of times with people on the right, because they found out I defended people who cracked jokes about 9/11. Like this happened more than once. And you know, by that time in my twenties, I'm not fist fighting again. But yeah, it was always like that. You see how hypocritical people can be. You can see how friends can turn on you if they don't like your politics. So I got an early preview of this, of what the culture we were heading into by being the president of fire. And it was exhausting. And that was one of the main things that led me to be suicidally depressed. At the Belmont Center, if you told me that that would be the beginning of a new and better life for me, I would have laughed if I could have, but I would, you know, I don't, you can tell I'm okay if I'm still laughing and I wasn't laughing at that point. So I got a doctor and I started doing cognitive behavioral therapy. I started having all these voices in my head that were catastrophizing and, you know, it gave me overgeneralization and fortune telling, you know, mind reading, all of these things that they teach you not to do. And what you do in CBT is essentially you have, something makes you upset and then you just write down what the thought was. And, you know, something minor could happen and your response was, you know, like, "Well, the date didn't seem to go very well. And that's because I'm broken and will die alone." And you're like, okay, okay, okay. What are the following, you know, that's catastrophizing, that's mind reading, that's fortune telling, that's all this stuff. And you have to do this several times a day, forever. I actually need to brush up on it at the moment. And it slowly over time, voices in my head that had been saying horrible, you know, horrible internal talk, it just didn't sound as convincing anymore, which was a really kind of like subtle effect. Like it was just kind of like, oh wait, I don't buy that I'm broken. You know, like that doesn't sound true. That doesn't sound like truth from God, like it used to. And nine months after I was planning to kill myself, I was probably happier than I'd been in a decade. And that was one of the things that, you know, that the CBT is what led me to notice this in my own work, that it felt like administrators were kind of selling cognitive distortions, but students weren't buying yet. And then when I started noticing that they seemed to come in actually already believing in a lot of this stuff, that it would be very dangerous. And that led to calling the American mind and all that stuff. But the thing that was rough about writing, canceling the American mind, and I've mentioned this already a couple of times, I got really depressed this past year because I was studying, you know, there's a friend in there that I talk about who killed himself after being canceled. I talked to him a week before he killed himself and I hadn't actually, I hadn't actually checked in with him because he seemed so confident. I thought he would be totally fine. Cause he, he had an insensitive tweet in June of 2020. And you know, got, got forced out in a way that didn't actually sound as bad as a lot of the other professors. He actually at least got a severance package, but they knew he'd sue and win. Cause he had before. And so I, I waited to check in on him cause we were so overwhelmed with the request for helps and he was saying people were coming to his house still. And then he, he shot himself the next week. And I, I definitely, and because everyone knows I'm so public about, you know, my struggles with this stuff, everybody who fights this stuff comes to me when they're having a hard time. Yeah. And this is a very hard psychologically taxing business to be in. And even admitting this right now, like I think about like all the, all the vultures out there, they'll have fun with it just like the same way. When, when, when my friend Mike Adams killed himself, there were people like celebrating on Twitter, um, that, that a man was dead, uh, because they didn't like his tweets and, but somehow that made them compassionate for some abstract other person. So I was getting a little depressed and anxious and the thing that really helped me. More than anything else, um, was confessing to my staff that I, you know, I, I, books take a lot of energy. So I, I knew, I knew they didn't wanna hear that. Not only was this taking a lot of the boss's time, this was making him depressed and anxious. But when I finally told my, the leadership of my staff, um, you know, people that even though I try to maintain a lot of distance from, I love very, very much. Um, it made such a difference, you know, um, because I could be open about that. And the other thing. Yeah. Um, I think that was, have you heard this conference dialogue? Oh, yes. It's like an invite only thing. Mm-hmm it's Oren Hoffman. Um, runs it. Um, it intentionally tries to get people over the political spectrum, um, to come together, uh, and have off the record conversations about big issues. And it was nice to be in a room where liberal conservative, none, none of the above were all like, oh, thank God someone's taken on council culture. Mm-hmm and where it felt like, it felt like maybe this won't be the, the disaster. For me and my family that I was, that, that I was starting to be afraid of it would be that taking the stuff on might actually have a happy ending. Well, one thing I just stands out from that is the, the pain of cancellation can be really intense. Mm-hmm and that doesn't necessarily mean losing your job, but just even you can call it bullying. You can call it whatever name, but just some number of people on the internet and that number. Yeah. It can be pretty small, kind of saying bad things to you. Yeah. That can be a pretty powerful force to the human psyche, which is, was very surprising. And then the flip side also of that, um, it really makes me sad how cruel people can be. Yeah. It's it's such a thinking that your, your cause is, uh, social justice in many cases can lead people to think I can be as cruel as I want in pursuit of this when a lot of people are just, you know, uh, just a way to sort of vent some aggression on, on a person that you think of only as an abstraction. So I think it's important for people to realize that they're whatever, like whatever, whatever negative energy, whatever negativity you want to put out there, like there's real people that can get hurt. Yeah. Like you can really get people, um, to one be the worst version of themselves. Or two possibly take their own life and it's not as real. Yeah. Well, that's one of the things that we do in the book, um, to, to really kind of address people who still try to claim this, you know, isn't real is we just quote, you know, we quote the Pope, we quote Obama, we quote James Carville, we quote Taylor Swift on cancel culture like, um, and Taylor Swift's quote is, is essentially about like how behind all of this, there's the, when it gets particularly nasty, there's this very clear, you know, kill yourself kind of undercurrent to it. Um, and it's, it's cruel. And the, and the problem is that in an environment so wide open, there's always going to be someone who wants to be so transgressive and say the most hurtful, you know, terrible thing. But then you have to remember the misrepresentation getting back to the old idioms, sticks and stones will break my bones, but names will never, never hurt me has been reimagined. In campus debates in the most asinine way, people will literally say stuff like, but now we know words can hurt. And it's like, now we know words can hurt guys. You didn't have to come up with a special little thing that you teach children to make her words hurt less. If they never hurt in the first place, it wouldn't even make sense. The saying it's a saying that you repeat to yourself to give yourself strength. When the bullies have noticed you're a little weird. That might be a little personal. Um, the, uh, and it helps, it really does help to be like, listen, okay. Assholes are going to say asshole things. Um, and I can't let them have that kind of power over me. Yeah. Yeah. It still is a learning experience. Cause it does, it does, it does hurt. But for the good people out there who actually, you know, just sometimes think, think that they're vented and you know, think about it. Remember that there are people on the other side of it. Yeah. For me, it hurts my kind of faith in humanity. Um, I know it shouldn't, but it does. Sometimes when I just see people being cruel to each other, it kind of, it's, uh, it floats a cloud over my perspective of the world that don't, I wish didn't have to be there. Yeah. I, that was always my sort of flippant, but, uh, answer to that. If mankind is basically good or basically evil being like the biggest debate in, in, in, in philosophy and being like, well, the problem with, uh, with the first is there's nothing basic about humanity. Yeah. What gives you hope about this whole thing about, about this dark state that we're in as you describe, how can we get out? What gives you hope that we will get out? I think that people are sick of it. Um, I think people are sick of not being able to be authentic. Um, and that's really, you know, what censorship is. It's basically telling you don't be yourself. Don't actually be to say what you think. Um, don't show your personality. Don't dissent. Don't be weird. Don't be wrong. Um, and that's not sustainable. I, I think that people have kind of had enough of it. Uh, but one thing I definitely wanna say to your audience is it can't just be up to us arguers to try to fix this. Um, and I think that, and this may sound like it's an unrelated problem. I think if there were. Highly respected, let's say extremely. Difficult ways to prove that you're extremely smart and hardworking that cost little or nothing that actually can give. The Harvards and the Yales of the world to run for their money. I think that might be the most positive thing we could do to, to, to deal with a lot of these problems and why I think the fact that we have become. A weird America with a great anti elitist tradition has become weirdly elitist in this, in, um, in the respect that we not only again, are our leadership. Coming from these few fancy schools, we actually have like great admiration for them. We kind of look up to them, but I think we'd have a lot healthier of a society if people could prove, you know, their excellence in ways that are coming from completely different streams and, and that, that, that are highly respected. I sometimes talk about there should be a test that anyone who passes it gets like a S you know, a BA in the humanities that it like a super BA like something like someone, not a GED. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about something that like, you know, one out of only a couple, like a hundred people can pass some other way of actually, um, uh, of not going through these massive bloated expensive institutions that people can raise their hands and say, I'm smart and hardworking. I think that could be an incredibly healthy, uh, way. I think we need additional streams for creative people to be solving problems, whether that's on X or someplace else. Um, I think that there's lots of things that technology could do to really help with this. I think some of the stuff that Sal Khan is working on, uh, at Khan Academy. It could really help. Um, so I think there's a lot of ways, but they exist largely around coming up with new ways of doing things, not just expecting the old things that have say $40 billion in the bank that they're going to reform themselves. And, and here, and here's my, you know, I've been picking on Harvard a lot, but I'm going to pick on them a little bit more. Um, the, and one, and, and, uh, I talk a lot about class again and you know, there's a great book called poison Ivy, um, by Evan Mandry, which I recommend to everybody. And it's outrageous. It sounds like me on a rant at Stanford, um, which was, uh, and I, and I think the stat is, you know, elite higher education has more kids from the top 1% than they have from the bottom 50 or 60%, depending on the school. Um, and when you look at how much they actually like replicate class privilege, it's, it's really distressing. So everybody should read poison Ivy. And above all else, uh, if you're weird to continue being weird. Yeah. And you're one of the most interesting, one of the weirdest in the most beautiful way people have ever met.
