I think PRDs, ENG design docs, RCA templates, quarterly ENG and product roadmaps, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Transcriptions of your meetings. Normally, you might see this stuff as a burden, but when your company is doing agent-native software development,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.220</a></span> | <span class="t">your process and your documentation is a knowledge base and a map for your droids to learn and imitate the way that your team thinks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">This documentation and process is a conversation with both future developers as well as future AI systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=633" target="_blank">00:10:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if you can communicate that why behind the decision, that context for those future developers and agents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.940</a></span> | <span class="t">if you can communicate, then you'll start to see that there's a huge lift in their ability to natively work the way that your team actually works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to talk about agent-driven development with respect to site reliability engineering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a lot that goes into a real incident response. It would be crazy for me to go up here and say you could actually just automate all of SRE and RCA work today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But there is a difference in the AI agent-driven approach, right? Here we're watching a droid take a sentry incident and convert it into a full RCA and mitigation plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Traditional incident response is effectively solving a puzzle. The pieces are scattered across dozens of systems. Logs in one place, metrics in another, historical context somewhere else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.140</a></span> | <span class="t">There's knowledge in your team's head. Droids in your organization fundamentally change this, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">When an alert triggers, you can pull in context from relevant system logs, past incident, runbooks in Notion or Confluence, team discussions from Slack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see that a droid that has the tools and the ability to access this can condense that search effort from hours to minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so really, the acceptable time to act for a standard enterprise organization, it's really going to be zero, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.620</a></span> | <span class="t">The moment that an incident happens, you should have a droid that's telling you exactly what happened, exactly how to fix it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And the thing that gets interesting is when you have user and organization level memory, you really start to build a model of what your team's response patterns and common issues are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's not just generating runbooks or generating a mitigation for one incident, right, but creating new processes that help solve some of these issues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And once you've written that RCA, right, you can move on to generate runbooks for those new learned patterns, update existing responses,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">RCA, right, and RCA, right, you can move on to the next slide, right, you can move on to the next slide, right, and then you can move on to the next slide, right, and then you can move on to the next slide, and then you can move on to the next slide, and then you can move on to the next slide, and then you can move on to the next slide, and then you can move on to the next slide.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we're seeing teams that are able to cut incident response time in half because context is immediate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They're able to reduce repeat incidents because the third time something happens, the droid starts to say, maybe we should fix this, and they're able to improve team collaboration because when a new engineer joins the team and says, how do we do this, it's already in memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, most importantly, what we're seeing in general is a shift from reactive to predictive operations because you can now start to really see the patterns across the entire operational history, and agentic systems turn each of these incidents into an opportunity to make the entire system far more reliable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.320</a></span> | <span class="t">AI agents are not replacing software engineers.</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:13:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">They're managing agents that can do multiple things at once, that are capable of organizing the systems, and they're building out patterns that supersede the inner loop of software development, and they're moving to the outer loop of software development.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheWKg2Tkrk&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">These are the types of questions that you should start asking today because YOLO mode
