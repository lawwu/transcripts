Well, we'll see, Jennifer. I mean, I think the culture around this, as I talk about, is changing. So by the time it's relevant, the culture on this may have already changed.</p><p>But in general, right now, the way I think about it is I'm fine with flip phones. Whatever age it is that it becomes convenient for you to be able to text your kid. They're at sports practice, and can you come pick me up? Or they want to text their friends, like, are you coming over today?</p><p>I don't know what age that becomes relevant. But a flip phone is fine. I have no problem with text communication, and I recognize that it's useful. Giving a kid, however, access to a full smartphone, or they have unrestricted access to the internet and social media, sanctioning your kid having social media accounts, I would say 16 at the youngest.</p><p>18, from the psychology perspective, is probably better. Hey, when you leave this house, you do you. But nothing good is going to come from an adolescent brain having access to it. This doesn't make me popular among a lot of teenagers. However, as I've written before and talked about before, the culture is changing on this.</p><p>I think the idea that teenagers should be using social media is something that we'll look back on six or seven years from now and say that was not a good idea. Teenagers themselves are also increasingly turning on this. They have moved most of their socializing out of tools such as Snapchat and into instant messenger and text messaging.</p><p>So social media no longer really plays as critical of a role in their social life. So it's much easier for them to not be on, say, Instagram or to not be on Snapchat because they're using text and WhatsApp type tools. Now the role these tools play in young people's lives is increasingly more cultural and entertainment related.</p><p>So TikTok is very popular with young kids. But not being on TikTok is not nearly as big of an issue as seven or eight years ago not being on Snapchat because people aren't using TikTok to talk to each other. People aren't using TikTok to discuss with other people in their schools, the party that went on, or to see where people are going, or to be plugged into a social scene.</p><p>They're largely consuming content on TikTok. So if you're not using it, who cares? You're communicating with your friends on text. They might be using TikTok. If you're not, what do you miss? There's some cultural theme that you don't know about. So I think things are getting better with that.</p><p>But honestly, that is my read of the psychological literature right now is be very, very wary of giving the adolescent brain unrestricted access to social internet tools.</p></div></div></body></html>
