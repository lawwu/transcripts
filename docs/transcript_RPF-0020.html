Cybersecurity Where You Are is available on all streaming platforms. Cybersecurity Where You Are So welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast for today. Today is Tuesday, July 15, 2014. And in today's show, we're going to be talking about one of my favorite subjects and a subject that I feel is absolutely valuable to just about every aspect of financial planning, which is entrepreneurship. And I'm going to introduce you to one of my favorite podcasts that I enjoy listening to and the host of that podcast, whose name is Jacob. Jake lives in the UK, and he's with us on the line. And we'll just get right into it. Jake, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast. Thanks, Joshua. Great to be chatting to you. So I don't want to sound too much like an overly adoring fan, but I do want to just tell you publicly and then tell the audience that I have thoroughly enjoyed the work that you have done through your podcast, through your website, and then also through the book that you've recently written. And I am sure that it has not been easy to produce all the content that you have produced, but I just want to say thank you for that, and I've really enjoyed it. So I appreciate all the work that you've done to produce the great content over the years. Awesome. That's great to hear. Thank you. So what I'd like to spend today doing is mainly talking about your book, which is called Becoming an Entrepreneur, How to Find Freedom and Fulfillment as a Business Owner. But before we get into that, and I hope to get into some specifics and talk about some of the ideas contained therein, could you give us just a quick background on yourself, a little bit of an introduction, and a quick background on your story? Sure. Well, I'm from the UK, and I did many things in my 20s before becoming an entrepreneur. I did a lot of postgraduate study, wasn't really sure what sort of career path to go into, didn't really even like the idea of a career path and working for somebody else. And I started a business using some of the things that I'd learned in postgraduate research about pedestrian flows. So I started my own. I started my own consulting company that was advising on pedestrian movement, and we were advising shopping centers and developers, and built that company until it got to the point where I was able to sell it, got its profitability, and then was able to sell it. And at that point, I basically quit the rat race and decided to focus on just doing other things that would bring me fulfillment. And part of those things has been learning about other ways that other people have quit the rat race, and that's really... That's really what my podcast, Voluntary Life, has covered. It's been about sort of the key benefits that I can see from entrepreneurship itself for finding more freedom and fulfillment in your life, and also talking to other people who have pursued their own entrepreneurial ventures and found other ways to find ways to quit the rat race themselves. So that's what I do now. I'm kind of a perpetual traveler. We're in the UK again at the moment, but we've spent most of the last two years, mainly in Mexico and South America, and I'm now focusing on writing. So I've just published the book that you mentioned, and I have another couple of books coming out soon. And yeah, just really enjoying this new phase in my life. I wasn't aware that you had new books coming out. What's the topic of your new books that you're working on going to be? Sorry, could you say that again? What's the topic of your new books that you're working on going to be? So I've got one that's just about to come out on a website called liberty.me, and that is a guide for negotiation. It's a book all about negotiation. So this is just a short guide, and I'm also working on a book really about for ways to quit the rat race. So I think you've seen that presentation that I did, and I'm writing that up. So that will be coming out as a book later this year as well. I have seen that presentation, and I'll make sure I would encourage if anybody hasn't, I will link to it on your website or your YouTube video at least of it in the show notes because it is well worth discussing. And I like how in that presentation you pull together the different ideas and you bring together the four ways that you see to get out of the rat race. And those four ways are off the top of my head, entrepreneurship, extreme savings. What were your four ways that you categorized it? Yeah, so basically unjobbing is one of them, extreme saving, entrepreneurship in terms of getting a passive income business, and then selling a business. Those are kind of the four ways that I've seen from people that I've spoken to to find a way to get out of the nine-to-five and get more freedom. Yeah, that's exactly right. Now I remember the four categories. So you pursued, in your story, it was number four, building a business and selling it. Yes, yeah, exactly. And so in my work as a financial planner over the years, one of the things that I have noticed is that in many ways people have very similar goals. It seems that most people desire. They desire to have more autonomy, more control over their life, more control over their schedule, more control over their direction, and also more financial freedom. And so one of the themes that I've noticed over the years is that in general, the conversation about these topics goes to building financial freedom. And so the idea is, well, I need to build up enough savings so that I can quit the rat race and have enough money to live on a passive income source, with basically having enough savings to sustain my lifestyle. But I've observed that, in my work as a financial planner, I've observed and noticed that it seems to me, one of the trends that I see, it seems to me that no one really ever quits the rat race. So right now, in this sense, no one ever stops working. And so right now, you would consider yourself to be financially independent, right? Yes. And yet you are probably working a good number of hours per week on your writing projects, on your podcasting projects. You are being productive for a fairly decent number of hours per week. Is that a correct assumption? Yes. And I think what I would say to that is that productivity itself brings me a huge amount of joy, as I think it does everyone. We get fulfillment from being effective, from getting things done, and from creating things and producing things. The problem, as I see it, is not doing stuff and being productive. It's when you have to work on things that you don't really believe in, like bringing you fulfillment or satisfaction, or having to work with people who you find really unenjoyable to be around and so forth. So yes, I do lots and lots of stuff. And I definitely see the opportunity that financial independence gives you. Not an opportunity to sort of sit on the sofa and watch DVDs, although I have definitely watched a lot of documentaries about the Roman Empire and who knows what else since I quit. Sure. But it's actually the opportunity to do whatever you love. That's what life's all about, getting a chance to work on things that you feel truly passionate about. So I'm a big fan of getting things done and being productive. But the question is having the opportunity to work on whatever is right for you. Yeah. And to me, this seems to be the missing key that not enough people are talking about, is that it's not so much that inactivity – so the thing that I've shared in previous episodes of the show, in my observation, is that motivated, productive people are the ones who accumulate the resources to be able to retire, to be able to not have to work for money any longer if they want to. They're motivated, they're productive, they're disciplined, they're savers. They live on less than they make. They accumulate capital and financial resources. And then they can deploy that capital to the point where they can be financially independent. But those types of people, it seems like they almost never quit. I did a show – I talked about Warren Buffett and Bill Gates and the – Mr. – Marriott and all of these people that are multi-billionaires and they never quit because they get meaning and enjoyment out of the work that they do. On the other hand, there are – I mean there are millions of people throughout the world for whom work is drudgery, for whom work is toil and labor. And many of them, it seems, desperately want to quit the rat race. But they can't seem to – many of them, not all of them – but many of them can't seem to accumulate any resources to be able to – to – to – to do it. And so what I see is that in financial planning, we should add a whole other step. And the step that I see is that we should forget about the idea of accumulating capital, to only be able to live off of capital at the beginning. And we should first start with the idea of saying, "How could I design a – how could I design a lifestyle that fits me, that allows me to have autonomy and self-control and do the things that I want to do?" And that's probably the only real way to do that, is to take control over your destiny and to be an entrepreneur in some way. And so I feel like it's this rather obvious step that we should all be talking about. But for whatever reason, entrepreneurship is not valued in our society, and people don't pursue that. So my question for you, A, do you agree with me? Has that been your experience? And B, why is it that we don't talk about entrepreneurship? Why is this not a business model or a financial planning model that's presented to people as a viable opportunity? Well, I definitely agree that entrepreneurship isn't talked about. I mean, one of the things that I mentioned in my book is that I didn't learn anything about entrepreneurship at school. I mean, and I don't think many people do. And in fact, quite the opposite. I think that part of what happens in terms of the way that we're all socialized, especially in school, is we are taught for over a decade by people who are lifelong employees. And we're given advice by career guidance counselors in schools, by people who are lifelong employees. And the whole design of the system of compulsory education is set up to, you know, basically put people -- to create employees, basically. It's a factory for the production of employees. And so I think the funny thing about entrepreneurship is that even though it's the engine of economic growth and even though it's absolutely essential to all of the great things that we enjoy in terms of our standard of living and the innovation that we have and, you know, and certainly it is respected still in our culture as well. But at the same time, it's actually something that people don't really get much of an insight into unless they're lucky enough to grow up amongst entrepreneurs and have contact with entrepreneurs. And in fact, you know, it's even worse than that because unfortunately the popular culture often shows insofar as entrepreneurship even gets shown, which they don't very much, but when they are shown, they're typically like villains. You know, they're like evil characters who are trying to take over the world and do something dastardly. And they're often shown as being -- if not evil geniuses, then they're kind of like miserly and not, you know, not people with a lot of heart and so forth. So I think in general, there's not a good basis for people to get an insight into the freedom that entrepreneurship provides and people do get what I call employee conditioning. You know, you kind of get trained to be an employee. And consequently, my experience was -- and I think a lot of people have the same experience -- I had to sort of deprogram myself to a certain degree of all of the prejudices about entrepreneurship and about business in general in order to kind of make the jump for myself and decide that I was going to start my own business and go for it. Do you think that the programming -- and I'm curious -- so you mentioned -- you cite in your bibliography to your book, you cite John Taylor Gatto's book, The Underground History of American Education. And I've read that book and would encourage anybody who's interested in some of this history to go and read it. That book, it's available free online on his website. And if you just search, you can find a PDF, which is a little bit easier to read than how he's released it for sections on his website. But the book gives you some fascinating history on the American educational system. And you opened one of your chapters -- I can't remember which one it was -- but you opened one of your chapters with a quote from John Dewey -- or it was in one of your chapters with a quote from John Dewey -- that the primary -- something along the lines of the primary goal of the education system is to create well-socialized people that will fit into the social order. That's my paraphrase of the quote. Yes. Yeah. Have you been able to figure out -- do you feel that this is just simply something that happened? Or do you feel it was maybe more designed? For example, did the facts just develop over time in a natural way? Or was it more conspiracy that that seems to be the natural result of our education system producing willing, obedient factory workers who aren't able to effectively exercise self-autonomy? What do you think at this point in your research? Well, I mean, I think certainly there are some people who are really explicit about it. You know, the John Dewey quote -- the other I quoted -- he's very explicit, like, this is our job as teachers is to mold people to fit in with the social order, which is the opposite of individuation. You know, the idea that the teacher's job is to mold you to fit in with what's existing is very explicitly said by him. And there are other people who have made similar comments to that in sort of educational luminaries they've written about. And I think that's a very good point. I think that's a very good point.

I think that's a very good point. I think that's a very good point. Yeah, I mean, in terms of what you said about selling and school and so forth, I totally agree. And this is another aspect of, in a sense, the kind of complete insulation that people have from the entrepreneurial world because you don't get any exposure to the absolute vital necessity of selling as part of win-win negotiation in all relationships in life when you're in school. You just don't get exposed to that. Teachers don't need to sell. And I think you're right. That intuitively, good teachers sell. Just in terms of trying to find ways of persuading students. They're good at it. But not because of the way that compulsory education is set up, but just because they're good at it. But when you look at the way that selling is kind of portrayed in popular culture and so forth, it is portrayed as if it's immoral and if it's kind of somehow ripping people off when selling is actually just the active side of win-win negotiation. Selling is the process of persuading somebody of the benefits of what you're doing. And that's what selling really means. Of course, there are people who are shady characters who use selling to try and pursue fraud or so forth, but that's not inherent in the nature of what selling is. And the only other thing I wanted to say in terms of thinking about what you said about school and not learning how to sell, and the other thing that's really interesting, especially in terms of the subject of your podcast, is people get no exposure to finance either. And certainly, I think that's a very important thing. I think that's a very important thing. And I think that's a very important thing. And I think that's a very important thing.

It's six paragraphs from Chapter 1. And Chapter 1 is entitled Breaking Free. It opens with a quote. Perfect freedom is reserved for the man who lives by his own work and, in that work, does what he wants to do. R.G. Collingwood. Entrepreneurship provides the best opportunity for anyone to experience the three most fulfilling intrinsic motivations in life. Purpose, mastery, and autonomy. Purpose is the motivation that comes from having an important reason for whatever you do. It is the conviction that what you're doing matters. Your work means something significant to you. You have the satisfaction of knowing that you are doing something useful with your life and that your work has value in the world. Mastery is the motivation that comes from a desire to achieve a high level of skill, control, and self-expression through what you do. It is the sense that you're involved in work that enables you to gain a greater sense of effectiveness, and consequently, greater self-esteem. Everything you do when starting your own business is a chance at mastery. The entrepreneurial skills that I found hardest to master were also those that became the most rewarding. Learning how to sell, learning how to create a working enterprise, and learning how to make a profit. Autonomy is the motivation that comes from wanting the freedom to do what you think is best with your life, not what anyone else thinks. Entrepreneurship is the only opportunity to seek financial freedom. The freedom. The freedom not to work on anything that you don't enjoy, that is open to anyone. This is the most genuine sense of freedom that you can experience. As an entrepreneur, you alone determine your goals. You have the opportunity to master your own challenges. You have the maximum freedom possible in what you do. Your own efforts lead to your own achievements and rewards. Entrepreneurship is an opportunity to live a purposeful life without regrets. It is the freest and most self-experienced. It is the most fulfilling way of life I know. Hopefully you're inspired to go and read Jake's book. I highly recommend it. He talks a lot about fear. He talks a lot about conditioning, about the things where we're scared to fail and where that comes from and how to overcome those fears. And he talks a lot about his practical experience in entrepreneurship. And he is certainly, in many ways, an inspiration. He worked hard. He took risk in business. Built a business. Sold it. Kind of achieved his number. And now he's working on projects that are important to him. And he's doing them of his own volition. But yet that's what the original entrepreneurial venture was in the beginning. So notice also, again, that he is continuing to be productive. This myth that we play for the rest of our life once we reach a certain financial freedom. I believe it's just that. As humans, I really feel we're driven to be productive. That's our show for today.
