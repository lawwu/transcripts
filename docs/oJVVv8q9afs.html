One, use strong drink like we use morphine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJVVv8q9afs&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">If someone is perishing and in great pain, use the means at your disposal to relieve the pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJVVv8q9afs&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Give strong drink to the one who is perishing. I don't think—this is his specific answer to his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJVVv8q9afs&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">question—I don't think that justifies us in using alcohol to escape our sorrows or our mental</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJVVv8q9afs&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">miseries.

Use it like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJVVv8q9afs&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">morphine. I mean, that's the way it's been used in history. Every TV western I've ever seen, when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJVVv8q9afs&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">they're gonna cut off the guy's finger, they give him whiskey, right? Well, so would I.

Number two, and this is what most of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJVVv8q9afs&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">commentators I've looked at believe is the case, namely that this is irony. This is Lemuel's mother</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJVVv8q9afs&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">who has just told her son that the king should beware of strong drink, and then she says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJVVv8q9afs&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">"Give it to the miserable." Tremper Longman, in his commentary, suggests that she would be saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJVVv8q9afs&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this. This is a quote, "Don't act like those derelicts who drink to forget their hardships.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJVVv8q9afs&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Be like the king you are." So it's irony. It's saying, "Go ahead and give it to them to do with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJVVv8q9afs&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it what they do, but you're the king, and you don't use alcohol that way." Now, frankly, I'm just not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJVVv8q9afs&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">sure which of those, but both of them, I think, would be legitimate interpretations of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJVVv8q9afs&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">verses.
