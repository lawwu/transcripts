And that really, if you just dwell on that and dwell on, well, what kinds of questions should I be asking and how should I go about asking them, how should I go about answering them when the author isn't present, and so on and so forth, then you'll get very far.</p><p>And they also say, conversely, and this isn't meant as a criticism, an undemanding reader asks no questions and gets no answers. And I certainly have read many, many books that way, particularly before I developed this habit. And I often found myself falling into that second category of the issue was not that I failed to remember things, but rather that my eyes just kind of skidded across paragraphs without even realizing it.</p></div></div></body></html>
