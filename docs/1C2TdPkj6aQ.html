And I'd already done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a couple of projects that were kind of going in that direction so I did. It turned out if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.860</a></span> | <span class="t">you build a canvas that other people can use people will build cool stuff with it. So today</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to be talking about some of the stuff that we've done with AI using our kind of our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">own toys playing with our own canvas here. So I'm here in TealDraw.com, it's a free whiteboard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You can come in, use it, make your diagrams, make your slides. Very, very similar in use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">case to Excalibur actually. But there are a few things that are kind of special here and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll show you real quick. So again this is TealDraw.com, free end user whiteboard application. And we also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">have TealDraw.dev which is the SDK website. If you wanted to build stuff with TealDraw then you could go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to TealDraw.dev and learn all about the the code and the documentation and how to do that. The cool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.240</a></span> | <span class="t">thing about the canvas is that it is. Well, I'll skip this one for a second. It is just normal web</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff. It's like react all the way down. So for example, I can do like things like, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">play YouTube videos and, you know, still interact with them, still draw on top of them. But the yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.620</a></span> | <span class="t">every one of these little shapes including like doing some pretty cool stuff like, you know, I have a whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.340</a></span> | <span class="t">code editor here. This is just code sandbox that's embedded in TealDraw.com. This one is Figma that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">like just is embedded in TealDraw.com. Even if you really like Excalibur, you can even use Excalibur</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">inside of TealDraw.com. So, and I'm pretty sure, I hope this doesn't break my slides, but if I paste</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the own, the TealDraw inside of itself, then we can, we can kind of, let me see if I can draw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">inside of TealDraw. Hang on a second. Yeah, right. We're kind of modifying the inner from the outer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever. I'll let you think about how that works. But yeah, and it has a lot of like kind of little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.900</a></span> | <span class="t">details. I'll do this really quick of like, you know, nice arrows that just, you know, perfectly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of follow the different shapes of things and, you know, boxes where the, you know, the corners of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the boxes always stay in the corners. That's right. So that's part of our value propositions that we take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">care of all these little like little details, make sure the corners are right, make sure the arrows are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">right, stuff like that. We did a couple of different AI stuff on top of this. And some of these are going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">work. Some of these are not going to work. Did we find out is this is this fell in the room here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.540</a></span> | <span class="t">The okay, well, in 2023, we had a lot of success with with make real, I'll skip this one for now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Make real was the idea that people were using TealDraw for whiteboarding, as well as what you're like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">drawing wireframes. And the idea would be like, well, what if we could take the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">diagrams that we were drawing the wireframes that we were drawing, and we could just kind of kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of make them real, right? What would be involved in that? And so we when the when the vision models came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">out like GPT-4 with vision. That's annoying. I'll have to do it myself. We, we realized you could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">just send a screenshot to continue, boom, to the model and say, hey, model, you're a web developer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">your designers just gave you this lo-fi thing. Can you can you create a higher like, can you actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">prototype this? Can you build it? And the models could do that really well. As usual, I'm going to kind of like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">give this a second to load while we are all right, they're really running with this input. All right,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.820</a></span> | <span class="t">well, the models have since become very, very ambitious. Here's another good one. Let's say I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.140</a></span> | <span class="t">want to have a stop motion application where like, I have a feed from my camera. And I want to be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to take pictures. And I want to be able to like, see all those pictures there. But I also want to be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">to play them like in series. Using only the the input here, right? I won't even do the title,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">just just to be to be fun. The model will will spin off on that. And it will eventually, we can kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">watch it generate, but it will eventually come up with this. I just did this during the last talk,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">where that's my app, you know, I can kind of do this is doing the onion skinning. And there's my gift,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And not surprising. I mean, you can add images to cursor and stuff like that. And it just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">works really well. But the fun part is because I'm going to stop this. Because this is back on the canvas,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.820</a></span> | <span class="t">you can actually annotate on top of the website, and use that as the next prompt, you kind of click</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">this kind of kind of just generate the next one. And I've done this already. But you can see that yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">sure enough, it made the button solid, like I asked it to. And so using these drawing tools as a way of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">not only generating stuff, but annotating and like kind of iterating through these, you can get some pretty,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty wild results. This came out at the end of 2023. It was one of the first kind of tools that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.820</a></span> | <span class="t">let people that couldn't program and couldn't create software to kind of do it. And it was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.700</a></span> | <span class="t">it was pretty remarkable. So like this, this being the input, leads to, you know, leads to an app. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">might have seen there the, that it just did a little flash of green, you know, there was just a bug involved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just took a screenshot of the bug and sent it together with the, the original source and said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, can you, can you fix that particular bug? And yeah, it did. So it's, it's pretty cool. The,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">um, if I don't crash my browser. Hey, all right, so that's make real. We also did this one called draw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">fast, which may or may not work. I'm just gonna see if it does. This used a thing called like latent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.340</a></span> | <span class="t">consistency models. I think that's the name basically like a, uh, create an image for me as fast as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.820</a></span> | <span class="t">possible. And we will see if I can wake up the, uh, the server here. Oh, Hey, look, Hey, this normally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't work special, uh, where you have a drawing, you have an image being created from the drawing. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I, as I changed the drawing, Oh, come on, do it. Uh, then the image is gonna, gonna change as well. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.700</a></span> | <span class="t">you can even take these things and flatten them like this. And now I can interact with the, um, the model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.780</a></span> | <span class="t">images like this and, you know, let's say I'm gonna rotate it or, or maybe stretch it out really big. Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, and in, in, in, in good circumstances, this stuff works almost in real time, but you'll have to, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I have to accept the, uh, uh, whatever, uh, the, the one, one moment of, uh, of working as the best we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C2TdPkj6aQ&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">gonna get. I'm gonna need to use two hands to do this, but no.
