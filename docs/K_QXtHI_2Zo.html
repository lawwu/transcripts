So for example, when I talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to people with addiction sometimes their initial foray into using a drug is to get pleasure, but very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">often it's a way to escape their suffering, whatever their suffering may be. And certainly as people become</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">addicted, even those who initially were seeking out pleasure are ultimately just trying to avoid the pain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of withdrawal or the pain of the consequences of their drug use. So I think it's very hard to actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.220</a></span> | <span class="t">define it as this unitary thing. And it's certainly not just getting a high. There are so many ways in which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.220</a></span> | <span class="t">people sort of want to escape, which is not the same thing as sort of this hedonic, you know, wanting to feel pleasure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">That's fascinating. So let's talk about the pleasure pain balance and addiction. And I've heard you use this seesaw or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.340</a></span> | <span class="t">balance scale analogy before. And I think it's a wonderful one that really, for me, clarified what addiction is, at least at the mechanistic level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so to me, one of the most significant findings in neuroscience in the last 75 years is that pleasure and pain are co-located,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">which means the same parts of the brain that process pleasure also process pain. And they work like a balance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we feel pleasure, our balance tips one way. When we feel pain, it tips in the opposite direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the overriding rules governing this balance is that it wants to stay level so it doesn't want to remain tipped very long to pleasure or to pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And with any deviation from neutrality, the brain will work very hard to restore a level balance or what scientists call homeostasis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way the brain does that is with any stimulus to one side, there will be a tip in equal and opposite amount to the other side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.460</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like you have principle laws of physics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, right. Right. So like, I like to watch YouTube videos when I watch YouTube videos of American Idol, you know, it tips to the side of pleasure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when I stop watching it, I have a come down, right, which is a tip to the equal and opposite amount on the other side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's that moment of wanting to watch one more YouTube video, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And I just want to interject there. So this moment of wanting to watch another that is associated with pain, I think, is, are we always aware of that happening?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you just described it in a very conscious way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But when I indulge in something I enjoy, I'm usually thinking about just wanting more of that thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, yes. I don't think about the pain, I just think about more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So really excellent point because we're mostly not aware of it. And it's also reflexive. So we, it's not something that consciously happens or that we're aware of unless we really begin to pay attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And when we begin to pay attention, we really can become very aware of it in the moment. Again, it's like a falling away, like that, you know, you're on social media and, you know, you get a good tweet of something and then you can't stop yourself because there's this awareness, a latent awareness that as soon as I disengage from this behavior, I'm going to experience a kind of a pain, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.500</a></span> | <span class="t">A falling away, a missing that feeling, a wanting more of it. And of course, one way to combat that is to do it more, right? And more and more and more. So I think, I think that is really what I want people to tune into and get an awareness around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Because once you tune into it, you can see it a lot. And then when you begin to see it, you have, and if you, you know, keep the model of the balance in mind, I think it gives people kind of a way to imagine what they're experiencing on a neurobiological level and understand it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And in that understanding, get some mastery over it, which is really what this is all about. Because ultimately, we do need to disengage, right? We can't live in that space all the time, right? We have other things we need to do. And there are also serious consequences that come with trying to repeat and continue that experience or that feeling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So if I understand this correctly, when we find something, or when something finds us, that we enjoy, that feels pleasureful, social media, food, sex, gambling, whatever happens to be, and we will explore the full range of these, there's some dopamine release when we engage in that behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what you're telling me is that very quickly. And beneath my conscious awareness, there's a tilting back of the scale, where pleasure is reduced by way of increasing pain, and I've heard you say before that the pain mechanism has some competitive advantages over the pleasure mechanism, such that it doesn't just bring the scale back to level,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it actually brings pain higher than pleasure. Could you tell us a little bit more about that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah. So what happens, again, so the hallmark of any addictive substance or behavior is that it releases a lot of dopamine in our brain's reward pathway, right? Like broccoli just doesn't release a lot of dopamine, just doesn't, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm trying to imagine, I was about to say, and I stopped myself because, no, broccoli's good, it can be really good, but broccoli is not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.980</a></span> | <span class="t">- Yeah, broccoli is never amazing. - Right. Broccoli's never amazing, I mean, honestly, we can probably find somebody on the planet for whom broccoli is amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">- Yeah. - And of course, if I'm starving, broccoli is amazing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">- Yeah, Rich Roll, Rich Roll is big on plants, and he has a good relationship to plants.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">- Right. - Rich, tell us how to make broccoli amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">If anyone could do it, he'd be rich. - Yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But what happens right after I do something that is really pleasurable and releases a lot of dopamine is, again, my brain is going to immediately compensate by down-regulating my own dopamine receptors, my own dopamine transmission, to compensate for that, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's that come down, or the hangover, or that after effect, that moment of wanting to do it more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if I just wait for that feeling to pass, then my dopamine will re-regulate itself, and I'll go back to whatever my chronic baseline is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But if I don't wait, and here's really the key, if I keep indulging again and again and again, ultimately, I have so much on the pain side, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">That I've essentially reset my brain to what we call like an anhedonic or lacking in joy type of state, which is a dopamine deficit state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's really the way in which pain can become the main driver is because I've indulged so much in these high reward behaviors or substances that my brain has had to compensate by way down-regulating my own dopamine such that even when I'm not doing that drug,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm in a dopamine deficit state, which is akin to a clinical depression, I have anxiety, irritability, insomnia, dysphoria, and a lot of mental preoccupation with using again or getting the drug.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's the piece there. There's the single use, which easily passes, but it's the chronic use that can then reset really our dopamine thresholds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then nothing is enjoyable, right? Then everything sort of pales in comparison to this one drug that I want to keep doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And that one drug could be a person, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I know people in my life that are still talking about this one relationship, this one person that was just so great, despite all the challenges of that thing, that it's almost like they're addicted to the narrative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They were, maybe you're still are addicted to the person. So it could be to any number of things, video games, sex, gambling, a person, a narrative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">To me, and because of the way you described this mechanism, this pleasure pain balance, that all speaks to the kind of generalize ability of our brain circuitry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is something that fascinates me and I know it fascinates you as well, which is that nature did not evolve 20 different mechanisms for 20 different types of addiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Just like anxiety is a couple of core sets of hormones and neurotransmitters and pathways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And one person is triggered by social interactions. Another person is triggered by spiders, but the underlying response is identical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It sounds like with addiction as well, there, there may be some nuance, but that they're sort of a core set of processes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So it doesn't really matter if it's gambling or video games or sex or a narrative about a previous lover or partner or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the same addictive process underneath that, is that correct?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, exactly. And that's where this whole idea of cross addiction comes in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So once you've been addicted to a substance, severely addicted, that makes you more vulnerable to addiction to any substance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you say substance, does the same, is what you just said also true for behaviors?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. So when I use the word drug, I'm talking about substances and behaviors really.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm talking about behaviors like gambling, sex, you know, gaming, porn. Absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_QXtHI_2Zo&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm talking about behaviors like gambling, sex, you know, and I'm talking about drugs.</span></div></div></body></html>
