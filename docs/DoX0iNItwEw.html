of the official unofficial Act 2 Network podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=10" target="_blank">00:00:10.700</a></span> | <span class="t">My name is Steven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=11" target="_blank">00:00:11.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm Isaiah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=12" target="_blank">00:00:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And we are excited to relaunch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=14" target="_blank">00:00:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I'm excited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=15" target="_blank">00:00:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if Isaiah is excited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=16" target="_blank">00:00:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=18" target="_blank">00:00:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">We are, whether we're excited or not, rebooting the podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=24" target="_blank">00:00:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're rebooting the podcast because as we grow, as our network scales, it is quite difficult to keep track of everything that's going on, even through all the different ways we try to update each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we want to tell stories of what God is doing at our church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's so many neat things that are happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.700</a></span> | <span class="t">There's so many behind the scenes sort of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.760</a></span> | <span class="t">There's ministry partners that come in and help and that we get to do really cool things with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we want to talk about those things and feature those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so for this first episode, we thought it might be good to just talk a little bit about what is the Act 2 Network and why do we change our name?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that mean anything?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">What about this new mission statement, which I think was kind of a big deal?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Quite a few things have changed since our last podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we just want to kind of frame everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So how should we do this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, maybe, maybe, Stephen, you can explain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, how would you explain to somebody either who's been in our network or our church for a while or someone new to it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, why did we make this move to change our name to Act 2 Network?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're Grace Point, now we're Act 2 Network.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what's the difference?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's a great question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you for making me answer it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I would say it really represents a new phase of our church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I mean, I'm using the word church, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're so used to using that word to describe who we are, and I think that's still a good thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a way in which that doesn't quite fit anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So Grace Point used to be, like, this church in, like, Berkeley.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And as we planted churches and, you know, we're at 30-plus campuses, 70-plus campuses, we're still calling ourselves church, Grace Point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's people in our network who have never been in Berkeley, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.540</a></span> | <span class="t">They're growing up, and the way that they know our church is their local ministry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we're in a wide variety of contexts, a diversity of ministries and teams and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're in kind of a new phase now, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">We hope that those relational bonds, you know, and we think those racial bonds need to continue to stay tight and strong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But, yeah, I think we're in a phase where, because of that scale and diversity, some things need to change, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And now we're on, what, 70-plus campuses, eight countries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it's huge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so network, at least that word, just seems to fit better for the reality that we're in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and then better to change the name when things are still tight and close instead of, like, when people are feeling like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I don't really know you anymore, and then change the name, and then it's kind of sad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and I think one thing that we also wanted to, as my understanding, at least, is one thing that we wanted to do is to give people kind of a clearer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe, like, a more accurate picture of, like, what sort of thing we are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I mean, like, I think biblically speaking, like, we are a church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I would say, like, a lot of groups that call themselves, like, parachurches or missions organizations, like, I don't know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">if you look at the way it kind of worked in the Bible, like, I do think those things are churches, and I think that's true of us, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, but I also think, so, yeah, I mean, technically we are a church, but I also know that when people use the word church,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">they have a certain expectation of, like, what that's going to look like, and often kind of the way we are doesn't quite fit into that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think we also wanted to sort of capture who we are and, like, that difference a little bit, that, no, we are, we're not just a typical local church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We're a network, and in a way, we're something closer to, like, a missions organization or a word we've tossed around is, like, an order, which sounds a little weird.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't really like that word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I'm not a big fan of the word, but I think it kind of...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But order in the sense of, like, a priestly or, like, the monks, like, a monastic order.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so we're not just, you know, a place that sets up and invites people to come in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">We're a little more than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, our motto is, hey, we are now launching lifelong kingdom workers for every college town, and so what we're about is saying, hey, come into this place not just to, you know, absorb a message or sit through a service, but really, if you're joining us, we want the understanding to be that, hey, our whole thing is we're going to turn you into a lifelong kingdom worker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And we recognize it's not for everybody, you know, and that's not what a lot of people are looking for in a church, and that's fine, and we don't want to denigrate people who don't want to join or other churches who work differently from us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But we feel like that's sort of the mission that God has called us to, to take people and say, hey, if you really want to be discipled in this way of becoming a lifelong kingdom worker, kind of, you know, in, I guess, the Acts 2 Network fashion, you know, then we have something really robust for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But if not, you know, that's okay, and we want you to know, like, you know, there are plenty of other good churches out there and that sort of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah, and so, like, I think even a lot of our local ministries have kind of rebranded themselves as college church, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And even that, like, that intentional decision is so that, you know, church, like, you think of families, you think of, like, you know, that sort of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But we're unique in that we target campuses, college campuses, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it is strange, like, someone steps in and, like, oh, this church is all college students.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">That's very atypical, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So just trying to signal that through the word, like, college church.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, yeah, we're trying to be more upfront with who we are and bring that clarity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">One phrase that keeps standing out to me from this whole time has been, clarity is kindness, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So trying to be more clear about who we are, even though there is a part of me that wants to, like, fight that battle to, like, reclaim the word church, to, like, make it mean what it actually means and change expectations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, yeah, that's a whole other podcast topic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it is, so I think our new slogan, right, launching lifelong kingdom workers from every college town.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It used to be the next church in every college town.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And that felt tough to leave that behind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like that was, I think we all thought, like, we were going to be pursuing that mission until the day we die.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Or when Jesus comes back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's like, oh, are we even, who are we now?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that we've moved on from that motto.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But I don't know, maybe, maybe, Steven, you can kind of share some insights into, like, what went into the thinking behind that and how we decided to kind of switch and why.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, like, before jumping into that, like, Axe 2 Network, like, we felt Axe 2, there were a lot of terrible names.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.740</a></span> | <span class="t">In retrospect, bad names.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Co-vocational Network, Tent Makers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, Tent Makers was, Tent Makers was my thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I still believe in that name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I was not for Tent Makers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We were on the opposite side of that debate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think Axe 2, that really being, it's that community, it's that togetherness, it's that, you know, church as family, that connection that really enables us to do everything that we do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, like, why do I feel like I can go to church plant?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not because I'm doing it on my own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=438" target="_blank">00:07:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It's because I'm doing it on my friends, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">If my friends weren't doing it with me, I don't think I would go, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And so those close relationships, that community, we really wanted to, like, make sure that was preserved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that, so we took care of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so that carried over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">That carried over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">That made the move.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so then launching Life on Kingdom Works from a college town.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">College town, still there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Still believe, you know, college ministry, college campus, unique place, unique time in people's lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a very special opportunity there for someone to receive the gospel and have their eternal trajectory changed and their lives transformed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, that's still a time where people are open and asking questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, we just felt like, okay, that needs to be preserved because we want to launch people from the college town, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And then launching Kingdom Workers, I think the idea there is whether you stay with our network or not, you know, we want everyone to, when they encounter us, have this thing that gets rubbed off of them, which is, like, my primary identity is that I'm a gospel minister.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it's not just a pastor who's doing the ministry from the pulpit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Ministry is not just for the professionals, but every, it's the priesthood of all believers, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Every believer is called to gospel ministry, and we want, like, you can come and experience that and see how that is lived out, and then wherever you go from there on, we hope you carry that identity with you, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and I think it's also kind of a reflection of sort of our changing picture of, like, what our church is going to look like or what our network is going to look like in the future, where I think for most of us, like, as, like, when we were in college, the picture was always, it was going to be pretty standard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, we're going to go to these college towns, we're going to start a college church that reaches, like, a big group of college students that are all coming together, and yeah, we had other ministries, but that was always the focus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But I do think as we've, as time has gone on, we're beginning to see, well, you know, maybe God wants more than that in the sense of, man, there's all these other ministries that we want to invest in, maybe just as heavily as college.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I feel like youth is really starting to kind of pick up steam.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I think international ministry is really big for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, we've made the move to, like, foreign missions, so it's like, oh, it's not just that we want to build a lot of college churches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's what we really are about is finding people and saying, hey, join us in this mission of doing kingdom work, wherever the context may be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we're starting to sort of see the genesis of that in a lot of different areas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So we felt like, I think, yeah, this new motto sort of captures that reality in a way that the old one didn't, like, the old one's maybe a little too limited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, very kind of narrow scope.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, for what we're thinking about now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, I mean, like, there's a bunch of college towns that can't sustain, like, the kind of, you know, co-vocational ministry that we do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.900</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, like, some places are so remote.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">There's not a lot of industry there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.180</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really hard for us to, like, move a team and start a church there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But we still want to reach that campus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the idea is not going there and planning a college church, but launching people, you know, into kingdom work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I think that this last word, lifelong, that's the one that's been standing out to me personally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Just the idea that, you know, as our church has gotten older, as people have gotten older and, you know, maybe they can't do college ministry anymore, right, health reasons or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, what meaningful ministry are you able to do then?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, like, can we continue to have you engaged because people want to stay engaged in ministry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So whatever season of life, you know, what support do you need?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What meaningful opportunities, what context do you need to be meaningfully engaged in gospel ministry, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's something that I was surprised, like, seems to be unique and distinctive, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">That, like, yeah, whether you're a young, single, 20-something-year-old or you're, you know, 30-whatever mom with two kids all the way up to, like, 50, 60, like, you can be engaged.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Meaningful gospel ministry, you just need the right support and context for that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it's really neat that, you know, you hear stories of people engaged in ministry in college or, like, through the 30s and then they burn out or, like, something happens in their life and they kind of step away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of them don't come back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of them don't step back into it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we feel like that's tragic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.980</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, we want to support people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We want to enable people to stay engaged in that, to keep doing the good work that God has prepared for them to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So one thing we say a lot is, like, everyone needs ministry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's really one of the driving principles behind everything we do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reality is we, like, if our whole thing is just, like, pouring back into our church and, like, trying to make our church as awesome as possible, like, you're just going to run out of things to do eventually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And, like, a lot of what I think motivates us is everyone needs ministry, not because, like, we just, like, keeping people busy, but because, like, that's the best thing for growth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the best life to live when you have people and, like, kingdom causes to actually, like, invest yourself in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, man, it's a lot of work sometimes because we're trying to just, like, construct ministry for people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, we're always in, like, okay, what is a new frontier we can open up?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And how can, you know, this person who maybe, you know, doesn't like being on the front lines of college ministry, like, how can they still be a part of the team and still be a part of kind of the greater work that we're doing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, I think in that way, like, that lifelong really captures kind of a pretty important aspect of us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and it's, you know, another aspect of lifelong is not just, like, my life, but it's the relationships we have.</span></div><div

for the long haul together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And how do we, yeah, like, all be actually and feel unified in this gospel work that we're doing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe you can't do college ministry, but, like, man, you're engaged in youth or you're engaged, like, in ECM or these other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can have that shared

target="_blank">00:13:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so one other new development since, in, like, the past, I guess, two years is this thing that we call the way of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, go on our website.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's very front and center.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Could you explain to the uninitiated, what is our way of life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Why did we come up with that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Why do we have that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">If I were to put it in just conventional terms, it's sort of, like, our core values, you know, but it's a little bit more than that because it's boiled down into, like, what does this look like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">How is this actually lived out in practice?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a little more, like, concrete, I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.580</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think as we were trying to figure out, as we were going through this name change and stuff, we were thinking about who we are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">What are the things that we want to clarify for people?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what does it mean to be part of our network?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, what are you, if you're embracing that, if you want to join that, what exactly are you joining?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.360</a></span> | <span

class="t">We want to clarify that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.620</a></span> | <span class="t">We tried to boil it down to those essential things, right, and tried to do it in a way that was concise and memorable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">It was very challenging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It was hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We went through many, many iterations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, it's got a cool 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, but if you add it up, it's 15 things, so it's a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But, yeah, I think it's, again, trying to provide that clarity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But I like the phrase way of life because it really does capture that, like, the way we're able to do all these things is that all of us have sort of agreed, like, this is the way that we feel God has called us to live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It might not be how every Christian, like, needs to live or it's not for everyone, but this is the way we feel like God has called us to live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And when we do that, it enables so much, like, amazing, like, it's the branch that you're sitting on, you know, that you don't want to cut off, you know, but it's what makes the whole thing work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like what you're saying about the clarity is kindness thing, I feel like the word of, I mean, word of life, way of life really feeds into that because we want people to be able to kind of have a picture, like, okay, hey, if you're considering joining the Ask2 Network, what does that mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.860</a></span> | <span class="t">What does that look like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, well, here it is, you know, this is the way we set up our lives and it's not easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a lot of stuff on there and we're not apologetic about that because we think it's a good way to live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not the only way to live, you know, you don't have to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, you know, we totally respect your decision if you feel like it's not for you, but we want to be upfront about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And I feel like, yeah, maybe in times past, like, that was sort of in the air and we sort of kind of by default did it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It was the culture, but it wasn't ever, like, really spelled out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So I'm glad we get confused.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people are like, is this like an essential part of the way of life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">No, no, that's not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what are the necessary parts almost?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So kind of having laid that out, my hope is that, you know, like for college students or whoever is new to our group, like, that'll just give them more clarity and kind of, hey, like, here it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.220</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, are you interested?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.060</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're not again, that's fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're interested, yeah, this is what it looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think to add to that, like, it is, it is hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.420</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think it's amazing to see the variety of people in our church who have embraced it and are growing in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.860</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it's not just for like, I don't know, like AP level, SWAT level, like Navy SEAL kind of Christians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, like it's hard, but the way we're able to do it is because, again, we're doing it together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, we're hoping to not just clarify it, but create tools and things like that to help people understand, like, how do you grow into this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it's not something we expect like a college freshman to jump into or even a high school youth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's something we expect people who graduate want to join us to embrace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not like it's a surprise either, because our it's our college ministries have that same vibe, that same feel, that ethos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">That we're where people, they are living the way of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it is something that's like, as you experience it, as you grow into it, as you practice it, maybe you begin to appreciate it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1022" target="_blank">00:17:02.020</a></span> | <span class="t">You begin to you feel your life kind of growing a capacity to handle it and you grow in your relationship with other people and you can tackle it together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's like a, wow, yeah, this is the way I want to live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, so it's not so much like a take it or leave it kind of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">It is a little bit of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But then there's also this other, I think, softness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think like, I think something that I have to explain to people sometimes who are kind of wondering about this whole way of life and like, why does your church like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Network.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, why is your church like this, essentially?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, and why do you like set the bar so high?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, just that's the reality of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we set a high bar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't know, I think my response to that is usually like, you know what, it takes all types to reach our world, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.140</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:17:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing because, you know, some people, some people, they need like that more charismatic aspect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.780</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, people like, people

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, but, you know, and for them, like that kind of charismatic, high emotion sort of experience is very helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, whereas for other people who are more reasonable like me, no, people who are just, you know, not as into that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, they'll find kind of a different expression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think sort of we look at our world and we say, hey, I think there's a need for this kind of church, you know, and this kind of group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we say, hey, we're going to try and fill that slot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't know, I guess I say, you know, even if you're not into that, like I would ask that you respect our decision to be that way, you know, because I think we have a certain mission and a certain goal and a certain cause that we're set on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And I feel like, yeah, by kind of embracing this way of life, it positions us to to fill that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I like the way you put that, because then I think it, you know, just it's kind of relevant with the thing I would add to that is we're not the first ones with the way of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, like this whole idea came out of, again, this idea of a monastic order.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1149" target="_blank">00:19:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, recent books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1151" target="_blank">00:19:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We're not monks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're not actually monastic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, the idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1154" target="_blank">00:19:14.700</a></span> | <span class="t">There have been times in Christian history where, like, yeah, that order came about, like the Benedict Option, you know, the Benedictine Order.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And they had a way of life they wanted to commit to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1165" target="_blank">00:19:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And for, like, that time in culture and in history, it was like, wow, really glad they did that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Because without the monks, we wouldn't have, like, literature, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.460</a></span> | <span class="t">We wouldn't have literacy and stuff like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, so we're not the first ones to come up with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1179" target="_blank">00:19:39.020</a></span> | <span class="t">We kind of took inspiration from them and mission organizations and stuff like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1182" target="_blank">00:19:42.100</a></span> | <span class="t">We felt like, hey, if we were to define our core values, that actually fits us really well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we sort of adopted that as a way that we wanted to clarify that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that kind of brings us back to this podcast a little bit because I think overall, if you're kind of reading between the lines, like, as we've embraced this identity of a network and not just like a typical church, I think one of the upshots of that or one of the outcomes of that is that we've just gotten more complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1208" target="_blank">00:20:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, like, there's just, like, more types of ministries and more stuff going on and all sorts of things happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And part of our hope for this podcast is that it'll help, you know, our people as well as people on the outside who are interested in learning more about us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1221" target="_blank">00:20:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it'll just help people get a handle on, like, what is this thing and what does it look like on the day to day?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1227" target="_blank">00:20:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, maybe if you are, like, a college student, you know, thinking about, like, hey, do I want to join this kind of weird group or not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1233" target="_blank">00:20:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it'll help you sort of sort through some of those things and make that decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1237" target="_blank">00:20:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I feel like because it is hard to understand, even as we talk about it, some of us were, like, as we talk about it, like, well, this is kind of complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1243" target="_blank">00:20:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It's kind of hard to explain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So hopefully this will give you sort of that lived experience aspect of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1249" target="_blank">00:20:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">That's my hope.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1250" target="_blank">00:20:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1250" target="_blank">00:20:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1250" target="_blank">00:20:50.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that, I mean, just to give a framework of that complication, you know, 70-plus campuses now, eight countries, we have ministries all the way from kids to, like, elderly care.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1262" target="_blank">00:21:02.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, we go cradle to the grave, man.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Cradle to the grave, man.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1264" target="_blank">00:21:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then ministry opportunities for everyone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Same way, even the kids are taking ownership over the younger kids, you know, all the way to, and reaching out to their friends in elementary school, all the way to, yeah, older people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1278" target="_blank">00:21:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">That's just, I'm just humbled, actually, to be a part of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1281" target="_blank">00:21:21.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like that is, it would just be so much easier to just, like, pick one thing and just, like, be really good at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1288" target="_blank">00:21:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But because we are covenanted to each other, it's produced something kind of complicated, but I think very beautiful as you hear all the different stories, as you see all the different things that people are trying to do to spread the gospel, as you see the way that people are trying to live life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1305" target="_blank">00:21:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I think if you step back, it is actually a very beautiful picture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.060</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it can be intimidating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It can be kind of crazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1310" target="_blank">00:21:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Messy but beautiful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1312" target="_blank">00:21:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Whoa, like, what is driving all this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1313" target="_blank">00:21:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the gospel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1314" target="_blank">00:21:54.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the love of God for us, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1316" target="_blank">00:21:56.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And through Christ, dying for us on the cross.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1319" target="_blank">00:21:59.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And, man, this is one, hopefully you see one very beautiful way that gets lived out that's very true to the gospel and the word of God.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1329" target="_blank">00:22:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like that's a good note to end on, huh?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1331" target="_blank">00:22:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1332" target="_blank">00:22:12.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe we can end it there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoX0iNItwEw&t=1333" target="_blank">00:22:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks for joining us for our first episode of the official, unofficial Axie Network
