Maybe not talking, but, like, you know, to get nerdy with. Great to end it off. Yeah, I'm not sure about replacement. I can go, like, ask around, I guess. No, I have Swix text.</p><p>Okay, okay, gotcha. Oh, also, for the compass thing, do you mind if I download the app on your phone? Because it has to stay on you. I think I need the link to stuff here. Yes. I'll be here as well. I do the whole thing. If anything happens. Sounds good.</p><p>Compass? Actually, if you go to Safari, there's a link, and then I'll share the link with you. Can you add-drop it? Yeah, I can do that. Let me get back to the console before you show anything, because I've turned it up a lot. Okay, I'm so glad you're here, Ernie.</p><p>You are still missing Santosh. Okay, first person, are you? Do what? I think you go first. Aren't you first? Like you're introducing? Just two minutes. Oh, okay. I mean, someone before you. Oh, who is that? Tentos? Yes. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero. Hello, everyone.</p><p>Hello, everyone. Is that better?
