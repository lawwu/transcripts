Maybe if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">really good quarterly, I can never clip a coupon again and make more from just negotiating my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">salary." And then a second level from that is, "Man, if I could figure out how to negotiate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">how to buy assets that cashflow and can do 100x or 300x return to me, then I don't even have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">negotiate my salary that much.

It was that it was categorically fucking miserable. It was miserable being in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">finance for so long, especially when I was at the big firms like Goldman Sachs, State Street,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Vanguard.

It was the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">opposite of a meritocracy, which is what I wanted. You could only progress in your career at certain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">levels and years and timelines like the military. So I was like, this is awful. Got to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Then I went to Goldman Sachs. And at Goldman, it was sort of the opposite. It was like, no matter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">what, 20% cut every single year. And if you don't perform, cut. And if people don't like you, cut.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that was a really aggressive environment. And I actually liked it more, I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But then finally, where I ended up was in private equity, running with a couple other partners. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I think what I realized, Chris, is you were smart.

It just took</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">me 12 years to figure this out.

I had a boss, basically, back in the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">We were in Latin America and we were running an investment business in there. And we basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">had to do this evolution with one of the government entities where they wanted us to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">run a process to make sure that our security protocols and the way we were investing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">met their government requirements. And so we ran that once. Check, check. All the boxes checked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that we were supposed to. They wanted us to run it again. So we ran it again. And then the last time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">they wanted us to run it one more time. And now, I didn't agree that we should run this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">exercise three times. I thought that was ridiculous. But my boss basically said, "Hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this go around. I'm agreeing to this. And the reason why is because I want to get our leaders</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to trust me a little bit more. And I also want to get our team used to doing things that are hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that we don't want to do, because we're going to have to do some really hard stuff for this project</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we were working on. There's a lot of turnaround assets." And so he's like, "So I need you guys</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to support me in doing that." And we looked around and I remember I asked, I was like, "Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">are they actually going to know if we did this or not? Can we just check the box that we did this?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And he just looked back at me and was like, "What do you think would be the right thing to do?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, "Oh, fuck. Fine." And so basically, I think the right way to do a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">business while you have a job is to make sure you're doing it the right way. And I think the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">only thing I see going wrong in people's lives is I've seen people get fired from their jobs when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">they don't disclose that they have a side hustle. And I think it eats at your soul a little bit to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">not live in the light. And so as an owner of a business, I take it personally, if people are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">working in my business and on my business, and really they're focused on something else, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">want to be doing something else. And remember, when you own a business in the future, you will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">be the person with employees that might be distracted. So I always kind of push people to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=857" target="_blank">00:14:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">think like you already are an owner, and then ask yourself, "What would you want your employees to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">do?" That's my only caveat to side hustles these days. I think those sites where people have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Reddit sites where they have 400 different jobs, and these people who talk about having 37 side</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">hustles, I actually think it makes you distracted, it makes you less happy, and it often makes you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">less money. And so if you're going to buy a business, make sure you do it the right way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">set the right amount of hours. And if your job doesn't allow for it, then pick a different job</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">or take the risk entirely. But don't be a human not living in the light is my only caveat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">That makes sense.

Why do you think it is that buying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a rental property is like, for some reason, so sexy when it comes to how do you spend your money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and build your wealth, and buying a business like a laundromat is just not even on the same radar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in terms of societal opinion?

They both are work. Why haven't people caught on? Is this like the secret? Obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you're the champion of it, but...

You could maybe make a house do a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit more in rent by having a nicer house, but you're putting a ton more cash in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So you go step one through 10, you have a rental property, those are clearly defined.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And because of that, lots of people do it.

And so three of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=2783" target="_blank">00:46:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">them were open to it. Two of them, I didn't like the deal. One of them, it was perfect timing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=2787" target="_blank">00:46:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I had mentioned this to them. They had a little bit of a conflict inside the company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=2790" target="_blank">00:46:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And I said to the guy, "Hey, how about if I acquire you guys? How about I buy your company?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=2795" target="_blank">00:46:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm going to buy out you four plus your gear.

So say I acquire all of them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=2822" target="_blank">00:47:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for salary of $100K for the year.

But if I hire all of them through an acqui-hire, and that $100,000 rolls through as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=2835" target="_blank">00:47:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">an expense payment for payroll, that lowers the total profits in my business and thus decreases</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=2841" target="_blank">00:47:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">my tax bill dollar for dollar. And so that was a cool way that I sort of gamed my little point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=2846" target="_blank">00:47:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">system.

One is, I find that technology,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=2886" target="_blank">00:48:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">by and large, we think that technology is going to help us.

Slack is one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=2932" target="_blank">00:48:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the most useful thing in my business.

Is there a thing in that space or is that what Bill wants you to go do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=3200" target="_blank">00:53:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, that is what Bill wants us to go do, for sure. But private equity funds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=3204" target="_blank">00:53:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">have varying sizes. What I found is below the $10 million in revenue mark is actually where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=3211" target="_blank">00:53:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of the meat is still on the bone. Once you get past 10, definitely $20 million in revenue,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=3217" target="_blank">00:53:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you're more playing with some of the bigger, lower middle market firms that are buying up some of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=3222" target="_blank">00:53:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">these companies. But below that, there's just not enough people playing because it's riskier and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=3227" target="_blank">00:53:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it's harder to scale.

And it's how much easier is it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=3237" target="_blank">00:53:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">allocate $100 million once or to 100 deals for $1 million, right? The second is categorically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=3246" target="_blank">00:54:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">harder to scale than the first. And so because of that, they go up market bigger and bigger and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=3250" target="_blank">00:54:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">bigger.

"Can I scale this to $100 million?" You're like, "How do I pick a couple of businesses where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=3284" target="_blank">00:54:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I can have an operator that runs this business and I just cashflow on it?

And he's like, "I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=3619" target="_blank">01:00:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">even know if I know how to buy businesses."

And to the left,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4051" target="_blank">01:07:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like high outcome or high leverage, low time. And on the bottom right, it's low leverage,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4059" target="_blank">01:07:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">high time. So the bottom would be the worst. Something that takes me a ton of time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4064" target="_blank">01:07:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and it doesn't have a great outcome for me. And at the top, it takes not a lot of time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4069" target="_blank">01:07:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's a great output for me. And the goal is basically, you want to spend all your time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4073" target="_blank">01:07:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in the left quadrant at the top. Very little of your time in the bottom right. So you want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4080" target="_blank">01:08:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">outsource all of those tasks. And then there'll probably be another quadrant right next to it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4083" target="_blank">01:08:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that's like high output, a lot of time. And maybe -- so you're spending all of your time in the top</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4088" target="_blank">01:08:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">two. And the bottom two quadrants, you're basically trying to offload all of those tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4093" target="_blank">01:08:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so every so often, I go back and do this version of the notepad challenge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4097" target="_blank">01:08:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's really, really helpful. And in the beginning, you do what you can afford,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4102" target="_blank">01:08:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you layer on top of it. But there's a saying, I can't remember who said it, but that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4107" target="_blank">01:08:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">your business is one -- or you are one hire away from a completely new business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4114" target="_blank">01:08:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's true also of your life. You are one hire away</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4117" target="_blank">01:08:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">from a completely different life. And it can be very small things. I can't remember the last time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4123" target="_blank">01:08:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I had to get on the call with AT&T or Verizon or deal with a cable provider or schedule my doctors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4131" target="_blank">01:08:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But six years ago, I spent hours on that stuff, haggling, dealing with issues,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4138" target="_blank">01:08:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">changing flights. I don't do any of that anymore. And it probably cost me about $1,000 a month to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4144" target="_blank">01:09:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">save me 10s and 10s and 10s of hours a month. And it's not just hours. It's like the overhead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4151" target="_blank">01:09:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of having to keep track of all of the things. So yeah, I'm a huge fan of that. We're almost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4157" target="_blank">01:09:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">out of time. I'm going to ask you one more thing. You have all of these great posts and threads</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4162" target="_blank">01:09:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where you're like, "Here's the way I've optimized this aspect of my life." I'm going to mention one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4166" target="_blank">01:09:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'll just link to it in the show notes, which is this 160 rule on Sundays about how you ask</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4170" target="_blank">01:09:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">yourself and check in on what you're doing. I think it's great. But the one that I was most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4175" target="_blank">01:09:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">recently looking at, that's a bit of a tangent from this conversation, was about a check-in you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4179" target="_blank">01:09:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">do on your relationship. And so I think maybe as a total aside from everything we've talked about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4183" target="_blank">01:09:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe share that a bit because I adopted it. I thought it was so great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4188" target="_blank">01:09:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, that makes me happy. I had no idea this would go as viral as it did. It's just what we do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4192" target="_blank">01:09:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We're busy. My husband works a lot too. He's a pretty serious guy, former Navy SEAL,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4200" target="_blank">01:10:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of a tough dude. And what was happening is we were building up tension throughout the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4206" target="_blank">01:10:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So little things, "Why are your socks out?

Very small</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4212" target="_blank">01:10:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">things would get blown out of proportion or they would just nag throughout the day. And so we came</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4218" target="_blank">01:10:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">up with this thing in partnership with this woman called Brandy who helped us called Team. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4223" target="_blank">01:10:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">basically what it is, it's an end of day check-in. And our goal is the little things that come up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4229" target="_blank">01:10:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">throughout the day, instead of just word-vomiting them at each other at any given point in which you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4234" target="_blank">01:10:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">feel annoyed and you're elevated, what if you wrote them down and you save them for later in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4238" target="_blank">01:10:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">a place where maybe you're having a nice glass of wine or for your biohackers out there, you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4243" target="_blank">01:10:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">doing whatever you do in the evening and you sit down with your spouse and the first tenant is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4250" target="_blank">01:10:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">touch. So T for touch. And it basically means you sit next to each other, you hold hands,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4255" target="_blank">01:10:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you put your feet on each other on the couch, whatever. Or when you're really mad,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4258" target="_blank">01:10:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we jokingly do this little ET one-finger touch thing. Because sometimes at the end of the day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4262" target="_blank">01:11:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you're still mad from what's going on. And you start with touch because you're reminding each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4267" target="_blank">01:11:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">other, "You guys are in this together. You're a team." The second step is education. So you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4271" target="_blank">01:11:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">how you come home from work a lot of times and you're like, "How was your day, honey? Good. How</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4274" target="_blank">01:11:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">was your day, honey?" Like blah, blah, blah. Same conversation. You don't get that deep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4277" target="_blank">01:11:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And that I think really leads to why a lot of people actually get divorced or cheat or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4283" target="_blank">01:11:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You stop dating your spouse and you stop getting the most interesting information out of them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4289" target="_blank">01:11:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">because your routine has meant that you ask the same lazy questions always, and you tell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4294" target="_blank">01:11:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">lazy stories. And so education means you have to tell your spouse one thing that you learned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4299" target="_blank">01:11:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that day that was new to you. And so that means it's usually a great conversation starter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4303" target="_blank">01:11:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So the education part will usually go longer. So I might be like, "Today I was with Chris,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4308" target="_blank">01:11:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and I just realized that we have a million points on Amex, and now I'm super stressed because we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4314" target="_blank">01:11:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have never used these. And so now I have to figure out how to optimize this. And did you know that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4317" target="_blank">01:11:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a whole group of people that this is all they do and we're not doing it?" So maybe that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4320" target="_blank">01:12:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">my thing. And then he'll tell me something. And then the next is appreciation. So even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4325" target="_blank">01:12:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">when you're mad, there is a reason why you chose this human to be with for life, for now, for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4331" target="_blank">01:12:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever. And so giving a little piece of gratitude typically helps diffuse what comes next. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4338" target="_blank">01:12:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're mad, it could be, "I appreciate you taking out the trash today."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4341" target="_blank">01:12:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Our only rule there is you can't keep repeating the same ones. "You're so beautiful. I love your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4346" target="_blank">01:12:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">hair." No, you got to get a little bit more creative. And then the last one is metrics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4352" target="_blank">01:12:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And here we basically say, "I kept my list of things that annoyed me today that I wish you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4357" target="_blank">01:12:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">would do differently." Or, "Here's this big thing that I want us to talk about." Or some days we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4362" target="_blank">01:12:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">really have nothing. But because you're not telling the person in the moment when you're upset at them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4368" target="_blank">01:12:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">about this thing, the level of intensity, emotional intensity is so decreased that typically we get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4376" target="_blank">01:12:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">through the metrics in a way where we're in our rational brains. We're not elevated. And so we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4381" target="_blank">01:13:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">have a really pretty easy conversation. And then the internet has actually changed up this one a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4386" target="_blank">01:13:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit. And they now think it is Teams. And at the end, it should be "Ask for sex."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4392" target="_blank">01:13:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's how you should add it. So up to you. That's an optional add-on at the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4397" target="_blank">01:13:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Alright. So I know that was a departure, but I think you have a few of these. I'm going to link</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4402" target="_blank">01:13:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to a couple of the other ones that you've done where you're just like, "Hey, here's the way I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4405" target="_blank">01:13:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">optimized this thing in my life."

It's like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmu8vGUKKE&t=4424" target="_blank">01:13:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">"Well, it's just a thing I do."
