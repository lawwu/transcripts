And that's not what storytelling is. That's wordsmith. That is wordplay. Storytelling is, here's the situation. Here's what's happening. Here's what's going to happen next. Here's why. Scripts are storytelling because they fill themselves with words, and they flow to the points.</p><p>The points are the elements of a story that lead you to the next piece. How many people are listening that have a favorite movie? And they watch it, and they know what happens, and they still like it. It's not because it's so cleverly written that you're just like magic with words.</p><p>You follow the story beat by beat by beat. And that's what makes it interesting, and that's what makes it fun.</p></div></div></body></html>
