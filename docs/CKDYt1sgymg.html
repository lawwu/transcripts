I have an explanation I want to give here, and then I want to deconstruct this explanation and give you a new way of thinking about improving your relationship with your device.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.460</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so here's what I want to argue is going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Part of the resistance or reluctance that people have to, let's say, taking popular apps off their phone is that they worry that it is an overreaction, that perhaps they are falling into a moral panic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I want to play some audio here to better emphasize what I mean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">This comes from the spring of 2019.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It was from an interview appearance I did on Brian Koppelman's podcast as part of the book tour for my book, Digital Minimalism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's hear this tape for a second, Jesse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I could have been a car minimalist, and I could have said, you know, that there are all these costs of having a car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You're not going to see the scenery. You know, we need nature, and we need to see the nature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.060</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to, you're risking in it, you know, if you have a slight inattention, you could crash.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so to me, it is, this argument is also, the cars are taking over. There's nothing you can do about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And we better instead learn how to use this stuff, the car, how to drive well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.540</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So what Koppelman was arguing there is a classic moral panic argument about, we hear about technology these days, which is like, look, we often get worried about new things, but these things are often not so bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the end, we might as, we end up being okay with them. So we might as well just get along with the process of learning how to use them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So he was saying, you just as easily, he was talking about my book, Digital Minimalism. He's saying like, look, you say you're a digital minimalist. He was saying that clip, you could use that same argument to have been a car minimalist in the early 20th century.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And be like, I don't want new cars, have these problems. We shouldn't have cars, but cars were inevitable. Cars were coming and they ended up, you know, we need cars. Life would be much harder without them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We wouldn't have the, you know, American growth like we had it without them. And so that was like a waste of time. It was alarmist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a common pushback that techno critics are familiar with. Now, I think this type of reasoning, this pushback fits particularly well when we talk about the trajectory of mass media, that tools like TikTok and Instagram are at the current end point of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we think about mass media in particular, we see some examples of perhaps people being really worked up into a lather when new medias came along and then eventually relaxing about them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So consider comic books, for example, these once terrified the fedora wearing pearl clutching adults of the era who were convinced that they were corrupting youth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">In a 1954 Senate subcommittee meeting, a leading anti-comic book advocate named Frederick Wortham testified as follows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It is my opinion without any reasonable doubt and without any reservation that comic books are an important contributing factor in many cases of juvenile delinquency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">He went on in that same testimony to say Batman is promoting homoeroticism and Wonder Woman is promoting sadomasochism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesse, I probably should have read more comic books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I don't know what's going on in those things, but man, I missed out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Television engendered similar concerns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's a quote from Wendell Berry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">He had a famous essay called Family Life, and it was included in his 1981 essay collection, The Gift of the Good Land.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And in it, Berry said the following,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">As soon as we see that the TV court is a vacuum line piping life and meaning out of the household, we can unplug it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, we're okay with comic books today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It blew over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">We're okay with TVs today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We all still have them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">We all still watch Netflix or Macs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We're not nearly as worried as Berry once was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question is, maybe we can just think about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Why can't we just think about social media as just the next stop on this trajectory?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the future when we're all using VR to hang out with alien versions of Mark Zuckerberg, we'll look back at the social media age and be like, come on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.020</a></span> | <span class="t">That was just technology that came and went, and we're okay with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But is this right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want to take a finer look at this argument of moral panic applied specifically to mass media, applied specifically to whether or not social media is just another thing on this trajectory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.340</a></span> | <span class="t">To help us make sense of this, here's what I'm going to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to return to an analogy that I introduced in an essay last spring that I was thinking about recently and realized, wait, this gives us some useful insight into this very specific question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the essay I want to draw from here came out last June.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm putting on the screen here for people who are watching instead of just listening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I wrote an essay June 19, 2024 that was called On Ultra Processed Content.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I did in this essay is I drew a connection between the nutritional notion of ultra processed food and social media content, which I was going to call ultra processed content.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to read you a few pieces from this because I think it's going to really help us figure out what's actually going on here with this type of information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.360</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So for my essay, I said, ultra processed foods at their most damaging extreme are made by breaking down core stock ingredients such as corn or soy into their basic organic building blocks, then recombining these elements into hyper palatable combinations rich in salt, sugar, and fat soaked with unpronounceable chemical emulsifiers and preservatives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The problem with ultra processed foods is that they are engineered to hijack our desire mechanisms, making them literally irresistible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The result is that we consume way more calories than we need in arguably the least healthy form possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.620</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">That's ultra processed food.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's connect that to digital information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Reading from the article again here, something similar happens with social media content.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas the stock ingredients for ultra processed food are found in vast fields of cheap corn and soy, social media content draws on vast databases of user generated information, post reactions, videos, quips, and memes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Recommendation algorithms then sift through this monumental collection of proto content to find new hard to resist combinations that will appeal to users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.820</a></span> | <span class="t">A feedback loop soon develops in which the producers of the stock content adapts to what seems to better please the platform, simplifying and purifying their outputs to more efficiently feed the algorithm's global goal of hijacking the human desire mechanisms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In this way, the users of social media platforms simulate something like the food scientist's ability to break down corn and reconstitute it into a hyper palatable edible food-like substance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">What is a TikTok dance mashup if not a digital Dorito?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think this analogy is useful because we treat in the world of nutrition ultra processed food differently than other types of food, including some food that's not that healthy for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

we should treat ultra processed content similar than we do other types of content, even content that's not necessarily super good for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So in particular, looking back in the world of nutrition, there has been a porous, to be sure, but important dividing line that's been made between processed food more broadly and ultra processed food more specifically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So processed food is, you know, any type of food that has gone through some sort of notable processing from its natural state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.320</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:07:54.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the other extreme, it's like ultra processed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But a lot of classic processed foods are things like, you know, bread or fresh baked cookies or something like this, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.500</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you need to eat whole foods and natural foods.</span></div><div class="c"><span

altogether on your diet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">That is

target="_blank">00:08:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And the people who do pull it off is an incredibly restrictive commitment to only having sort of like minimally processed fresh whole foods.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">That should be a lot of your

also cut out things that, you know, people actually enjoyed in life that were part of cultural traditions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:10:22.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The social media content is the ultra processed food.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">We look at things like, I don't know, watching streaming services on TV or digital

target="_blank">00:10:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're in front of the TV, binging Netflix eight hours a day, that's bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Also don't eat canned soup all day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But like you can have some of that in your life, not a big deal.</span></div><div

content like TikTok does into its most constituent smallest atomic elements and then algorithmically reconstituted into something that resembles content but is like no other content that anyone has ever constructed from scratch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And it is hyper palatable and you can't put it away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.700</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.700</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the psychological equivalent of the physical unwellness you get from eating ultra processed actual nutritious foods as well, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.920</a></span> |

| <span class="t">This now becomes, I believe, an intellectually coherent argument.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't mean that it's necessarily the answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And we know people in the world of nutrition who like can have a couple Oreos and be like, I'm done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Most people, you open up a bag of Oreos, they're going to crush four sleeves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people don't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But most people, it's easier to say, just don't have Oreos in the house.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So I bring this up just to make the argument that this analogy of ultra processed food and how it compares to processed food gives us at the very least an intellectually coherent and internally consistent argument for why you might say to someone, yeah, it's true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">We might have overreacted about television and comic books and yet you probably still shouldn't use TikTok.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Because sometimes in a particular space, as technology advances, its ability to do harm gets worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And as we advance along there, it's the more advanced versions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">We're like, okay, that's too far.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So I do think there's an intellectually consistent or coherent and internally consistent argument for social media being an exceptional danger in the world of mass media.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And just something I was thinking about is this ultra processed food analogy helps make that clear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So there you go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

good question because I think it connects to our deep dive where we talked about content like TikTok being ultra-processed, that unlike other types of content like television, streaming, or games on your phone, it has a way of being hyperpalatable and it has a way of pushing your buttons in ways that's really psychologically unhealthy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think it's worth looking into because I actually think I know something about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1605" target="_blank">00:26:45.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I did some research on this back when there was an internal document that got leaked and this was sort of making its rounds and I read a bunch of accounts of this document.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1613" target="_blank">00:26:53.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I have like a generic sense of the techniques used by a TikTok

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1630" target="_blank">00:27:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this sort of establishes the way that we kind of get this

that comes from the founder of an organization called Algo Transparency, which I think kind of gives the wrong idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1643" target="_blank">00:27:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But let me read this and then I'll give you the right idea.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1646" target="_blank">00:27:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Each video a kid watches, TikTok gains a piece of information on him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1651" target="_blank">00:27:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">In a few hours, the algorithm can

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1658" target="_blank">00:27:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a high risk that some of this information will be used against

micro-target him or make him more addicted to the platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1666" target="_blank">00:27:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Technically, all of that is true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1668" target="_blank">00:27:48.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think the way that we talk about algorithms here gives us an incomplete understanding of how these things actually work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1675" target="_blank">00:27:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I think when we see those type of description of algorithms, what we really imagine is sort of like someone making a list of descriptive information about a user.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1682" target="_blank">00:28:02.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, we've learned that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1685" target="_blank">00:28:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">We imagine an algorithm sort of like looking at these semantically rich descriptions of things you're into or not into and deciding according to some sort of complicated rules that someone programmed in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1696" target="_blank">00:28:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

image of an algorithm, it's like a network scheduler looking at a board full of pieces of information on index cards and making a decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1720" target="_blank">00:28:40.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, well, what are we going to schedule next?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1722" target="_blank">00:28:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this is really going to catch his attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1723" target="_blank">00:28:43.860</a></span> | <span class="t">We have that idea, which is sort of personified.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1728" target="_blank">00:28:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We imagine like there's a human involved and it gives us the sense that we can turn these various knobs and say things like, hey, adjust your algorithm to not recommend stuff that is going to be so addictive or adjust your algorithm to like turn down the outrage meter from like a 10 to a 9.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1745" target="_blank">00:29:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">When we think about the algorithm as like a person with all this information, making scheduling decisions, we think we have all this control over it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1753" target="_blank">00:29:13.300</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not really how this works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1755" target="_blank">00:29:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to try here to draw a picture for those who are watching instead of just listening and God help us all for me doing this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1760" target="_blank">00:29:20.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But I want to give you a better sense of how the general class of algorithms that we think powers TikTok actually works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1766" target="_blank">00:29:26.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can imagine what we do is that every time you watch a video, there's a piece of information that's gathered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1773" target="_blank">00:29:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But what's gathered is a description of the video.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1779" target="_blank">00:29:39.540</a></span> | <span class="t">This description, though, is going to be a bunch of numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1782" target="_blank">00:29:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's going to be, you could think of it like a lot of different categories you could use to apply to a video.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1788" target="_blank">00:29:48.060</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, cats could be a category.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1791" target="_blank">00:29:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">If it has a lot of cats, that number is high or low or something like this, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1794" target="_blank">00:29:54.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you have different numbers in each of these categories sort of gives you a list of numbers that describes the video.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1801" target="_blank">00:30:01.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we had, for example, just two numbers, we could imagine having a flat surface like a two-dimensional plane where you could put a, each spot in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1813" target="_blank">00:30:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if we put a spot right here is associated with two numbers, like with that number and with that number, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1822" target="_blank">00:30:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can imagine what we do is every time you watch a video, we can put a little dot on here that represents its description.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1827" target="_blank">00:30:27.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can make that dot bigger or smaller depending, and this seems to be what's most crucial for TikTok, how long you watch it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1836" target="_blank">00:30:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Like what percentage of the video you actually watched.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1839" target="_blank">00:30:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So like maybe you watched a video over here real briefly, small dot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1842" target="_blank">00:30:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Over here, though, there's a video you watched all the way through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1844" target="_blank">00:30:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There's like a big dot over there, and maybe there's a medium dot, and you kind of sampled some videos over here, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1853" target="_blank">00:30:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And over time, we're kind of just giving you videos to watch, and we see how long are you watching each of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1861" target="_blank">00:31:01.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So now we have a bunch of these numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1862" target="_blank">00:31:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We have this plot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1863" target="_blank">00:31:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Technically, it's going to be a sort of weighted multidimensional scatter plot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And now when we want to show you a new video, we being TikTok, the algorithm is super mathematical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1874" target="_blank">00:31:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It says, okay, I'm just going to randomly choose a video in this spot of possible videos to show you, but I'm not going to select from every area equally likely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1886" target="_blank">00:31:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The more sort of green real estate there is in a certain place, like the more I'm going to be pulled in that direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1893" target="_blank">00:31:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So like I might select something over here, but I'm way more likely to select something over here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1898" target="_blank">00:31:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">because there's so many, not only just so many other dots, but so many big dots.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1902" target="_blank">00:31:42.140</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of watch time over in this space of the possible videos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1906" target="_blank">00:31:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we're implicitly doing here is kind of creating a region.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1911" target="_blank">00:31:51.300</a></span> | <span class="t">These are all going to be probably roughly similarly types of videos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1915" target="_blank">00:31:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, again, my algorithm is doing something very simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1917" target="_blank">00:31:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just randomly choose a thing, but wait your choice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1919" target="_blank">00:31:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the more stuff there is nearby it, more mass you want to put on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1924" target="_blank">00:32:04.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's like a lot of probabilistic ways you could do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1926" target="_blank">00:32:06.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to start selecting more videos near stuff you already like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1930" target="_blank">00:32:10.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But like occasionally, you know, you roll a dice enough time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1933" target="_blank">00:32:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes you're going to roll six, three times in a row.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1935" target="_blank">00:32:15.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Occasionally I'll pull some stuff over here as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1939" target="_blank">00:32:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe what I'll do, and we think that the TikTok algorithm does this on purpose, it will on a semi-regular basis say forget the weights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1947" target="_blank">00:32:27.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And let me just like purely draw randomly just to make sure there's not something we haven't tried yet that you really like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1952" target="_blank">00:32:32.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And then like maybe over here, there is like a whole bunch of Cal network memes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1957" target="_blank">00:32:37.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And immediately these start getting watched well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1962" target="_blank">00:32:42.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And now it's like you're getting a lot of Cal network memes and then like a lot of the times of the stuff over here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1969" target="_blank">00:32:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And occasionally we'll sample other types of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1971" target="_blank">00:32:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what's happening underneath the covers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1974" target="_blank">00:32:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not just two numbers though.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1975" target="_blank">00:32:55.980</a></span> | <span class="t">It'll be like a hundred numbers or a thousand numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1978" target="_blank">00:32:58.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is each of these spots is in a thousand dimensional space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1981" target="_blank">00:33:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So the math is different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1984" target="_blank">00:33:04.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's the same idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1985" target="_blank">00:33:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">What's key about this is the algorithm is stupid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1988" target="_blank">00:33:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">The algorithm, there is no complicated code in there that humans wrote that's like how do I balance this versus that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1995" target="_blank">00:33:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't label things necessarily in the way you think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=1999" target="_blank">00:33:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Like is this outrageous or not?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2001" target="_blank">00:33:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean it does categorization and try to get rid of stuff for safety purposes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2004" target="_blank">00:33:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But like it really just mainly treats stuff like these numbers and it's just blindly doing this simple repetitive loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2011" target="_blank">00:33:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Pick another video probabilistically from the space of videos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2016" target="_blank">00:33:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Weight your choice towards stuff that's already been watched.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2018" target="_blank">00:33:38.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're more likely to choose something near a bunch of other stuff that's been watched a while than other stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2023" target="_blank">00:33:43.780</a></span> | <span class="t">On a regular basis though, randomly just choose something completely different to make sure that we're exploring other types of videos they might like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2031" target="_blank">00:33:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">This simple loop run tight enough for the only input it's getting from you is how long did you watch each video and how do we automatically categorize the video with some sort of neural net.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2041" target="_blank">00:34:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">That is enough to like within 30 or 40 minutes be eerily accurate in showing you stuff that you really like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2050" target="_blank">00:34:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Without there ever having to be anywhere like an English language list of like topics and here's what this person likes and complicated algorithms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2057" target="_blank">00:34:17.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a very simple weighted random sampling algorithm with a little bit of exploration or exploitation types of logic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2065" target="_blank">00:34:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It's called multi-arm band.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2066" target="_blank">00:34:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It's called stochastic optimization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2068" target="_blank">00:34:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't have to worry about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2069" target="_blank">00:34:29.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But like occasionally sampling other stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2071" target="_blank">00:34:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a very simple algorithm run again and again and again that has an eerily effective complex effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2077" target="_blank">00:34:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So anyways, I think that's interesting to know because it tells us that you can't control these things as much as you think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2083" target="_blank">00:34:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You can filter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2084" target="_blank">00:34:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you can say, hey, before we even recommend something, we can like filter as just like really inappropriate content and just like let's not recommend that at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2095" target="_blank">00:34:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You could like manually put shadow bands on things like, okay, anything with this category, I'm going to type into my system, like minimize its weight so we're much less likely to show other stuff like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2105" target="_blank">00:35:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">You can do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2106" target="_blank">00:35:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But there is, for the most part, you don't have knobs to turn, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2111" target="_blank">00:35:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You just say sample stuff near stuff they like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2113" target="_blank">00:35:13.820</a></span> | <span class="t">TikTok works really well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2115" target="_blank">00:35:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You can keep that on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:38:19.380</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2300" target="_blank">00:38:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first heading here says waiting kills flow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2302" target="_blank">00:38:22.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, looking closer at this animation, I'll make this bigger here for those who are watching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2307" target="_blank">00:38:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What they are showing here is an AI agent working in what is at the moment the only context that I know of where something like agentic AI code is actually not just useful, but being somewhat largely applied, which is in computer programming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2324" target="_blank">00:38:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So the AI agent that's being shown on the screen here is an AI agent that is helping you write software.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2331" target="_blank">00:38:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is, I think, right now the perhaps the only major application of agentic AI that I know of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2339" target="_blank">00:38:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, agentic AI is where you have control software surrounding the use of something like a language model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2346" target="_blank">00:39:06.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So it can query the language model for an idea or a plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2349" target="_blank">00:39:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the control software can look at the answer and then take actions based on the answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2354" target="_blank">00:39:14.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So when it comes to computer programming, here's another example here for those who are watching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2358" target="_blank">00:39:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">When it comes to building like a semi-complicated vibe coding style computer program, you can have these agentic code like Cursor, Windsurf, or Roo, where what you're doing is it'll like first have the language model give you like a bunch of steps you need to do to build a software product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2376" target="_blank">00:39:36.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it'll be like, okay, you want us to do step one?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2378" target="_blank">00:39:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And you say, yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2379" target="_blank">00:39:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's like, great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2380" target="_blank">00:39:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the software will then query the language model to get the code for step one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2385" target="_blank">00:39:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it'll run it and be like, oh, there's errors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2389" target="_blank">00:39:49.340</a></span> | <span class="t">You want us to like try to fix it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2390" target="_blank">00:39:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2391" target="_blank">00:39:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And you kind of work on step one and the agent sort of makes queries on the language model on your behalf until that step has working code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2397" target="_blank">00:39:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it's like, you want to go to step two and you go to step two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2399" target="_blank">00:39:59.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And it allows you to build more complicated software than if you just ask the language model, give me code for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2404" target="_blank">00:40:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Like if you say, give me code, it has to be a relatively small thing it solves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2409" target="_blank">00:40:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you do this multi-step thing, Agendic AI lets you do more things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2412" target="_blank">00:40:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So the more complicated projects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2414" target="_blank">00:40:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So the argument here is that, and I've seen this, I've sat next to people that showed me them using these systems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2422" target="_blank">00:40:22.680</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of waiting, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2425" target="_blank">00:40:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Because these language models aren't fast to query because, you know, you might have 500 billion parameters being executed by multiple GPUs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2432" target="_blank">00:40:32.680</a></span> | <span class="t">There's queues.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2433" target="_blank">00:40:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It's slow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2434" target="_blank">00:40:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So all of these animations I showed you, a lot of it is like thinking line by line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2439" target="_blank">00:40:39.640</a></span> | <span class="t">You see things happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2440" target="_blank">00:40:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So this whole article is like, how do you not get too distracted while you're waiting for your agentic software when you're building software to like finish thinking?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2449" target="_blank">00:40:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think they are fans of my work because they talk about if you're jumping over to social media or like your phone, man, you're going to get so context shifted and overloaded that you're going to, your brain's going to burn out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2462" target="_blank">00:41:02.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So then they argue here, like what you should do, and here's their solution is you should have something like an obsidian powered to do list next to your coding so that when this starts thinking, you can go over here and work on something productive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2478" target="_blank">00:41:18.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when it's done, go back over here and then you're never really leaving the context of the project, but you're also not just sitting there bored.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2488" target="_blank">00:41:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't know, there's something I like and something I dislike about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2490" target="_blank">00:41:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I like their general application of, hey, be wary of context shifts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2495" target="_blank">00:41:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">We have this idea of deep breaks where like if you want to take a mini break from what you're doing, there's ways to do it so that you don't fry your mental circuit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2503" target="_blank">00:41:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So working on the to-do list for the larger project keeps you within like the general cognitive context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2509" target="_blank">00:41:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the sort of less exciting side of this example is like this is kind of it for agentic AI right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2515" target="_blank">00:41:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm still, we talked about this last week at the end of the show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2519" target="_blank">00:41:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I talked about this in my recent email newsletter post AI and work, which you can find at calnewport.com.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2524" target="_blank">00:42:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">We're not sure how many applications we're going to have for agentic AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2529" target="_blank">00:42:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Open AI says everything's going to be done by agents and we're never going to have to have jobs again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2532" target="_blank">00:42:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's going to somehow generate like $20 billion like next year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2536" target="_blank">00:42:16.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a lot of technical obstacles to applying this agentic approach to other types of work that we do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2543" target="_blank">00:42:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not just like building somewhat subtly constructed small size software applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2549" target="_blank">00:42:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a bunch of stuff going on here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2552" target="_blank">00:42:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's an interesting application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2553" target="_blank">00:42:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, if you're coding with agentic AI, this is actually like a new problem we haven't had before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2558" target="_blank">00:42:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you do when you're waiting for the, actually we have had this before, it's compile time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2562" target="_blank">00:42:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I take that back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2564" target="_blank">00:42:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a common problem for computer programmers is computers didn't used to be super powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2569" target="_blank">00:42:49.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So every time you change your code to rerun it, you had to compile and rebuild the project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2573" target="_blank">00:42:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And it takes a while to test to see if it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2576" target="_blank">00:42:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I actually, you know what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2578" target="_blank">00:42:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I take it back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2578" target="_blank">00:42:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Programmers have been talking about this forever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2580" target="_blank">00:43:00.020</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you do while you're waiting to compile?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2581" target="_blank">00:43:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we've had questions like this before on the show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2583" target="_blank">00:43:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's nothing new here, but I think it's a good insight, at least from an AI perspective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2587" target="_blank">00:43:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">This is like one of the places, if not the only place where agentic AI is kind of doing interesting things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2592" target="_blank">00:43:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So it'll be interesting to see if we get other places going forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2596" target="_blank">00:43:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't yet have our podcast producer, agentic AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2599" target="_blank">00:43:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it would take this podcast in weird places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2602" target="_blank">00:43:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It'd be a lot of like Cal Network and Jesse Skeleton, weird memes, like cutting back and forth, going to CrossFit gyms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2611" target="_blank">00:43:31.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And it would be a massive success.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2613" target="_blank">00:43:33.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Not there yet, though.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2616" target="_blank">00:43:36.540</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2617" target="_blank">00:43:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Looks like we have a case study this week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2619" target="_blank">00:43:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It's where people send in their examples of using the type of advice I

one of our maintenance technicians.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2641" target="_blank">00:44:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2648" target="_blank">00:44:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">He flipped through the pages and casually said,</span></div><div class="c"><span

said.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=2724" target="_blank">00:45:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">He said he'd never heard the

out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3001" target="_blank">00:50:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It'd be like a nice, you know, half page to your paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3004" target="_blank">00:50:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I find you can do that for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3006" target="_blank">00:50:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And now I was in the door and I was involved in this paper and I was there and I saw every draft and I saw how it worked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3011" target="_blank">00:50:11.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And when the next paper came up, which was like a follow up, I was like, well, here's a corner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3017" target="_blank">00:50:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the corner of

way to be useful on the high quality stuff, a small handhold on a big swing project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3027" target="_blank">00:50:27.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And I made those handholds bigger and bigger until after a year or so, I was like, now I know what goes into writing these papers and I could really take off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3034" target="_blank">00:50:34.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And now I wasn't dependent on waiting for other people to be writing a paper to work on and I could start my own and I published a lot of papers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3040" target="_blank">00:50:40.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So, work with your advisor on the best possible papers.</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:57:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The first was a book called Building, A Carpenter's Notes on Life and the Art of Good Work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3469" target="_blank">00:57:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">This was by Mark Ellison.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3470" target="_blank">00:57:50.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You might recognize the name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3472" target="_blank">00:57:52.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So, he was profiled in The New Yorker years back as this carpenter that does super high-end custom installations in Manhattan high-rises.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3480" target="_blank">00:58:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So, he's like this brilliant carpenter that you have some dream of a very complicated, intricate collection of wood</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3488" target="_blank">00:58:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and all sorts of shapes, like a staircase that does crazy things.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3492" target="_blank">00:58:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, I think there was a Burkhardt-Bilger profile of him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3497" target="_blank">00:58:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyways, he wrote this whole book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3498" target="_blank">00:58:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like a memoir.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3499" target="_blank">00:58:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It's about work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3500" target="_blank">00:58:20.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It's about

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3504" target="_blank">00:58:24.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I liked it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3505" target="_blank">00:58:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Then I read Thoreau's Axe by Caleb Smith.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3507" target="_blank">00:58:27.940</a></span> | <span class="t">This is more of an academic book, really.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3511" target="_blank">00:58:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So, by academic, I mean, it's Princeton University Press.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3513" target="_blank">00:58:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's about the way people wrote about focus and attention in the 19th century American context, which includes, of course, Thoreau, hence the title.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3525" target="_blank">00:58:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's expository, I guess, in the sense of it's an academic secondary source book where the author, Caleb Smith, has broken it up into categories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3534" target="_blank">00:58:54.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's a lot of like, here's a quote, and I'll explain a little bit about what this is in the context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3538" target="_blank">00:58:58.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not like there's a through line of a singular argument.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3542" target="_blank">00:59:02.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it's not like an idea book where they're trying to say, here's my point, and I'm going to draw from these sources to make this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3548" target="_blank">00:59:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes we get this in academic adjacent books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3551" target="_blank">00:59:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, there's a great one called The Wandering Mind where this medievalist, Jamie Krenner, is looking at the way that monks in the medieval period dealt with distraction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3559" target="_blank">00:59:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But she was also meditating on that and trying to, like, give us better insights about dealing with attention and distraction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3565" target="_blank">00:59:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">This is not that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3566" target="_blank">00:59:26.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It really is like I'm doing the academic work of finding the various ways that attention and focus were talked on in the 19th centuries and categorizing them and trying to explain it for you to then use in, like, whatever other academic project you're going to use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3582" target="_blank">00:59:42.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not really a read this through and change your life book, but it was, I mean, I came across a lot of interesting and marked up a lot, pulled out some ideas from there I'm going to use in other books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3592" target="_blank">00:59:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, it's academic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3593" target="_blank">00:59:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Interestingly, I bought Building and Thoreau's Acts at the same time at Labyrinth Books in Princeton last December.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3600" target="_blank">01:00:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's funny how this happens sometimes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3603" target="_blank">01:00:03.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I bought those books together, and for whatever reason, they both came back into my attention last month, and I just read them back to back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3609" target="_blank">01:00:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't always read things right away, but I usually get the things I buy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3613" target="_blank">01:00:13.500</a></span> | <span class="t">The next book I read was Nine Innings by Daniel Ockrent.</span></div><div

goes through the nine innings, you learn a lot about the backstory of the teams and baseball,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3632" target="_blank">01:00:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and Bud Siegelig is the owner of the ownership team of the Brewers, and they talk a lot about the free agency rule is pretty new at this

about baseball and these players, and it's all built on the structure of a particular nine-inning game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3647" target="_blank">01:00:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So I like that type of book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3704" target="_blank">01:01:44.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I got an advanced copy, but I just jumped on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3706" target="_blank">01:01:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It's called Against the Machine by Paul Kingsnorth, who's both a novelist and has done a lot of writing about things like modern ecology and environmental movements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3716" target="_blank">01:01:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a really cool book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3717" target="_blank">01:01:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not—I think it's coming out in the fall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3719" target="_blank">01:01:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I really enjoyed it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3722" target="_blank">01:02:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It's what I call a high-idea book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3723" target="_blank">01:02:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, in idea books, there's high-idea and low-idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3725" target="_blank">01:02:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">My books probably fall a little bit more into low-idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3728" target="_blank">01:02:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">By that, I mean—I don't mean it pejoratively, but a low-idea book is usually—I have an idea that's going to change the way you see something about your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3736" target="_blank">01:02:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to help you then deploy that idea to potentially make changes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3740" target="_blank">01:02:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">High-idea books is mainly just, I've got a big idea about the way the world works, and I'm just going to, like, make my case, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3748" target="_blank">01:02:28.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he has this big case against what he calls the machine, which is what he describes as a sort of, like, totalizing capitalism-driven push towards just breaking down all order and tradition at the altar of economic growth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3765" target="_blank">01:02:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">What's interesting about the book is that he's an interesting guy, a former Wiccan, interestingly, now a Greek Orthodox Christian.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3773" target="_blank">01:02:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">He doesn't come at this from a classical 20th century theory perspective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3779" target="_blank">01:02:59.460</a></span> | <span class="t">He thinks, you know, like, classic leftist theory, like Marxism, or more modern leftist theory, like the more postmodern identity-based theories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3786" target="_blank">01:03:06.820</a></span> | <span class="t">He's like, that's all just part of the machine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3789" target="_blank">01:03:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You think that you're revolting against, like, capitalism, but what you're doing is you're just helping to break down all the existing structures and ritual and routine and tradition that helps the machine spread more, and it's just as bad as what's happening on the right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3799" target="_blank">01:03:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And he comes at it much more from, like, a place of, I guess, place and folklore and the messy details of, like, other people and connection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3809" target="_blank">01:03:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's anti-capitalist, but not, like, classic left anti-capitalist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3814" target="_blank">01:03:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it has a lot of interesting commentary about technology as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3817" target="_blank">01:03:37.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting guy, former Wiccan, Greek Orthodox, lives on a small farm in West Ireland, which is beautiful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3823" target="_blank">01:03:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been out there before, but also is, like, long-listed for the Booker Prize for one of his novels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3828"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3832" target="_blank">01:03:52.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I like high-idea books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3836" target="_blank">01:03:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of, like, Jacques Lull, a lot of Lewis Mumford in there, a lot of Neil Postman, Marshall McLuhan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3841" target="_blank">01:04:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I enjoyed that book, but it's not out yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDYt1sgymg&t=3844" target="_blank">01:04:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Also,
