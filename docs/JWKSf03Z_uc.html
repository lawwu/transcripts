I've been thinking about this topic. I'm writing a chapter in my new book on this, so I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">beginning to bounce ideas around about this topic. And what I want to do today is start by first figuring out what are the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">actual problems that we would want a minimally viable productivity system to solve. Then two, identify what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">are the key components a system that solved those problems would need to feature. And then three, give some ideas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">about then how might you concretely implement those components. Here I think the key is there is no one right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">answer. Once we know the minimal components of a minimally viable productivity system, I just want to talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">what might you look for in implementing these and how you actually do it can be a choose your own adventure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So that's our goal. Let's get into it. I want to start by saying, what should the goals be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">for a minimally viable productivity system? I don't have this locked in yet, but I've been thinking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">this for a couple of weeks now. And there's three goals that come up most common when I think about what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I really want out of this. The first is going to be stress reduction. I need a productivity system to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">make my life less stressful. This is sort of table stakes for trying to bring more organization to your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">life in the first place. Second, I need this system to increase people's perceived understanding of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">responsibility or increase my responsibility. What I mean by this is professionally, I don't want to be dropping the ball.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">However, this system runs, I don't want to be seen as someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">who may or may not get something done. If you give it to me, I want to be someone you can trust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I want the same thing to happen to my life outside of work. If a friend or someone in my community needs me to handle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">something for them or ask for my help, they trust. I'm not going to forget about it. I'm not going to flake.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So whatever the system does, it should give me that sense of responsibility. I'm someone you can count on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Finally, I think whatever else the system does, it has to be able to help me make at least some progress</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">on things that are important but non-urgent. I think that word some there does a lot of work because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">depending on what circumstance or stage of life you're in, how much progress you might be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">make on an important non-urgent matter could really vary. I mean, if you're like 24 years old and your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.240</a></span> | <span class="t">job is not that demanding and you have some sort of big idea you want to make progress on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you could be spending a lot of time working on this. The other extreme, we can go all the way to like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Viktor Frankl in Man's Search for Meaning, his memoir of his time during the Holocaust and then the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">psychotherapy field called logotherapy that he created in its wake. And there he was pointing out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">just having something, no matter how minor it could seem in a different context, having something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you are working on that you control because you chose to do it is critical, not just to human flourishing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">but human survival. So we've got this whole spectrum of what doing some work could mean. But the key is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a system should make sure that there's always some room for you to make progress on stuff that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">important that no one's asking you to do it, that you have some autonomy and control in your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want those three things out of any system, but I want the minimal system that gets me those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">That's my goal right now. All right. So then I started thinking, what components would a system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have to have to satisfy those three things? This too is contentious, but after thinking about this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">for a few weeks, three things came to mind. Here's my best swing. The first is there's got to be some notion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of task management, right? So there has to be some way of keeping track of the things that you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">agreed to do that is not just in your brain.

You're not going to drop the ball on things. It's going to reduce the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">stress of just trying to remember things in your brain or forgetting about things until the last minute and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">having deadline overload, which is like a huge source of acute stress in people's lives also as a way to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">keep track and remember of the things you need to do to make progress on non-urgent tasks.

Well, here, look, you need some way of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">estimating your current workload. So what is on my plate? We sometimes use the phrase on this show,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">facing the productivity dragon, just facing directly.

Like this is roughly how much I can do at once. That estimate may be broken down into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">different types of work. And so you should be able to compare those two things and have some sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">where your actual workload is going beyond your estimated, like this is what I'm comfortably can handle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And the workload management needs some collection of rules and tools that you use to try to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.320</a></span> | <span class="t">keep those two things balanced.

So if my job is connected to that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=1892" target="_blank">00:31:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll be happy, right?

So the purpose trap is, yeah, this is kind of terrible. Like for whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=1933" target="_blank">00:32:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">reason, like where the hours, the lack of money, the stress, but it's important like the field I'm in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=1942" target="_blank">00:32:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to put up with those other things.

It only comes up so often, right? I mean, some interviews are rich with these. If you're watching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=2128" target="_blank">00:35:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">an interview show, some have none, but I put timestamps down temporarily in Apple notes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=2133" target="_blank">00:35:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you can go later and write those down somewhere else. The other thing I sometimes do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=2138" target="_blank">00:35:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this will happen a lot if I'm working out and I'm listening to a podcast and then I get an idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=2143" target="_blank">00:35:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, ooh, that like gives me an idea what they're just talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=2146" target="_blank">00:35:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I voice dictate into Gmail, email to myself.

Right? So there's no question about that. And we have, like they have in the agile</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=2229" target="_blank">00:37:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">methodology, these daily stand-ups that are like 10 minutes long.

They found this daily stand-up worked much better. So students really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=2288" target="_blank">00:38:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">know what they were working on.

There's a format to it. And if they're interested, they're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=3124" target="_blank">00:52:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">let's talk.

You're like, shoot, I like the idea of writing this book. But the reality of the story</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=3143" target="_blank">00:52:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is that like, I could start querying agents this week and by next week, know that none of them are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=3147" target="_blank">00:52:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">interested.

Because your mind kind of knows like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=3152" target="_blank">00:52:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't really have this fully worked out.

Good news</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=3167" target="_blank">00:52:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">is you don't have to worry about tricking yourself to write or motivation or willpower procrastination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=3172" target="_blank">00:52:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">The bad news is getting to step two of nonfiction book writing is like really hard.

What they mean is that they have believed for a long time that we are on a path to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=3931" target="_blank">01:05:31.160</a></span> | <span class="t">creating transformational artificial intelligence capable of doing basically anything a human being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=3936" target="_blank">01:05:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">could do behind a computer, but better. They thought it would take somewhere from five to 15 years to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=3941" target="_blank">01:05:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">develop, but now they believe it's coming in two to three years during Donald Trump's second term.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=3945" target="_blank">01:05:45.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They believe it because of the products they're releasing right now and what they're seeing inside</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=3950" target="_blank">01:05:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the places they work and I think they're right." All right, so not surprisingly, this podcast has many of my New York Times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=3957" target="_blank">01:05:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">reading coastal friends worried about AI. Like if you just kind of hear this wording casually and you're not in the AI industry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=3966" target="_blank">01:06:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and you're not a computer scientist, this does kind of sound like we're a couple years away from Skynet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=3972" target="_blank">01:06:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? Machines getting out of control. Machines making us unnerved about turning them off. Machines</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=3980" target="_blank">01:06:20.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that are causing consequences that we didn't anticipate. So existential challenges. But are we?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=3987" target="_blank">01:06:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, no. And I want to start by saying there's a meaningful distinction between AGI and that other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=3994" target="_blank">01:06:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">scenario which we should better call superintelligence. And I think it is worth reviewing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4000" target="_blank">01:06:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this distinction. If for anything so you'll have a more accurate view of what's coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4004" target="_blank">01:06:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and also have a more accurate view of other things that maybe are farther in the future that's worth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4009" target="_blank">01:06:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">keeping an eye on. All right, so AGI in the way Ezra is talking about here is actually, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4014" target="_blank">01:06:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it sounds like a big thing. We achieve AGI, something has happened. When that happens,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4019" target="_blank">01:06:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we cross that threshold, something is worrisome. It is really, you can think of it as an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4022" target="_blank">01:07:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">arbitrary quality threshold for the things that these language models are already doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4030" target="_blank">01:07:10.440</a></span> | <span class="t">This is actually what experts mean when they talk about AGI right now. It's like right now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4034" target="_blank">01:07:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I can ask ChatGPT to create a memo summarizing whatever historical factors relating to like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4041" target="_blank">01:07:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">adoption of a certain type of technology. And it will do this like pretty well. It'll like pull on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4047" target="_blank">01:07:27.400</a></span> | <span class="t">information. It'll be written properly. It'll be on the topic. Probably not as good as like having a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4053" target="_blank">01:07:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">researcher do it, but it'll do it pretty well. It's going to get better at this. And at some point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4058" target="_blank">01:07:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it'll get good enough at writing this memos. We'll say like that's crossed the AGI threshold. Like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4061" target="_blank">01:07:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that's as good as like a good researcher would do. It's like this arbitrary threshold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4065" target="_blank">01:07:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not that when we cross that threshold, there'll be suddenly new things that artificial</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4071" target="_blank">01:07:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">intelligence can do that it hasn't been able to do before. It's the things you already know it can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4075" target="_blank">01:07:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">have gotten past the sort of arbitrary subjective threshold of like that seems as good as like humans</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4080" target="_blank">01:08:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">are doing it. It's like kind of around there right now. Like it can write a pretty good memo. It can write a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4084" target="_blank">01:08:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty good joke. It can write pretty good computer code, but not quite as good as a person. Like soon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4088" target="_blank">01:08:08.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it will be as good as a person. That's AGI. Now this has real economic and security consequences. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4095" target="_blank">01:08:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">better these models get at these things, there are these real world consequences that get worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4102" target="_blank">01:08:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And Ezra and Ben get into these in the interview. It really is about both security and economic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4107" target="_blank">01:08:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">consequences of this. But when you recognize what AGI is, is like an arbitrary quality threshold and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4111" target="_blank">01:08:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff. AI is already doing pretty well and not some sort of new capabilities. We realize it is serious,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4118" target="_blank">01:08:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's not the type of thing that James Cameron's going to make a movie about. Let's talk though about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4124" target="_blank">01:08:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the things that James Cameron did make a movie about. And that is this idea of super intelligence of AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4130" target="_blank">01:08:50.120</a></span> | <span class="t">getting increasingly autonomous and smart until it's smarter than us as designers. And then all sorts of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4135" target="_blank">01:08:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">sci-fi chaos happens.

It is separate as we just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4142" target="_blank">01:09:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">established from AGI, but it's not impossible. So why don't we talk about that? So here's the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4149" target="_blank">01:09:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">here's a conversation Ezra did not have, which is like, what, what would be needed for super intelligence?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4154" target="_blank">01:09:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And are we on track to that or not?

But I just listened to Ezra's podcast and figured, let's rock and roll.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4885" target="_blank">01:21:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So is the paper for Georgia?

I'd write it for an academic journal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4888" target="_blank">01:21:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah, it'd be a Georgetown thing. By the way, I'm looking at this video from Ezra's podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4894" target="_blank">01:21:34.120</a></span> | <span class="t">He now wears like a blazer and I don't even know that was him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4898" target="_blank">01:21:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, that's not him. That's been. Oh, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4900" target="_blank">01:21:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah. He has a beard now. I've done a show a couple of times. It used to be more casual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4905" target="_blank">01:21:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, yeah, look at that. He's got like, he, I should wear a blazer. Look, they have a fireplace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4910" target="_blank">01:21:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh man, we got to up our game. New York Times is up there again. When I first did Ezra's show back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4914" target="_blank">01:21:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">when he was still at Vox, they use Slate Studios here in downtown DC. And it was just like a nondescript,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4921" target="_blank">01:22:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">just a studio with sound a crates and there's no video back then. So we just in a t-shirt or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4928" target="_blank">01:22:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then during the pandemic, I did a show and it's just at his house. And yeah, he would just like zoom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4933" target="_blank">01:22:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in or whatever. So he's up to his game. Um, so what's an example of a problem that can't be solved?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4939" target="_blank">01:22:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, is there a God? No. So, so, okay. You have to formalize not to go down this rabbit hole too much,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4944" target="_blank">01:22:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but you have to formalize what we mean by a problem. Um, so like one way you can formalize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4950" target="_blank">01:22:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a problem is you can imagine like you, you, your abstract computer algorithm is given an input,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4957" target="_blank">01:22:37.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like some sort of data or like a string. And all you have to do is accept it or reject it. Is this good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4963" target="_blank">01:22:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">or bad? And so in, in this formulation, this is like Mike Sipser's formulation of computability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4968" target="_blank">01:22:48.600</a></span> | <span class="t">from his famous textbook. I also studied with Mike Sipser. Um, in this formulation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4973" target="_blank">01:22:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a problem is just a collection of inputs that you should accept. So to solve a problem in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4978" target="_blank">01:22:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">particular formulation, it's just, you have the ability of accepting any input that's from that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4984" target="_blank">01:23:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that set and reject anything that's not. And because these sets can be infinite,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4989" target="_blank">01:23:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like you can't just have it all hard coded, right? If you just think of a problem that way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4994" target="_blank">01:23:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the number of problems is what's known as uncountably infinite. Whereas the number of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=4999" target="_blank">01:23:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">programs is countably infinite. And these are two different sizes of infinity. They're vastly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=5003" target="_blank">01:23:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">different. It's the difference between whole numbers and numbers with like infinite decimal places.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=5007" target="_blank">01:23:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Then, and Turing did all this, by the way, in his original paper, uh, on computable numbers and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=5012" target="_blank">01:23:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">their application to the Anschlodung theory. So it's like famous 1930s paper that like laid out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=5016" target="_blank">01:23:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">all these issues pre-computer. He then said, look, we can look at, we can identify specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=5021" target="_blank">01:23:41.320</a></span> | <span class="t">problems that can't be solved. So like here is the, the very first problem he identified that can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=5025" target="_blank">01:23:45.080</a></span> | <span class="t">be solved. That like actually is a problem that many of these like uncountably infinite problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=5029" target="_blank">01:23:49.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of them don't have like a short summary. They're just abstract problems, but there's a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=5033" target="_blank">01:23:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you can identify that are specific problems that can't be solved. The very first unsolvable problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=5038" target="_blank">01:23:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">identified by Turing was the halting problem. So he said, like, imagine here's your challenge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=5043" target="_blank">01:24:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You have a program and the input we're going to give your program is two things, another program</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=5050" target="_blank">01:24:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and an input to that other program, right? So like, here's some source code and here's like a file</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=5055" target="_blank">01:24:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to run the program on. And your job as the program is to say, if I run this input program</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=5062" target="_blank">01:24:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">on this input, will it halt or will it loop forever? Like if I run this on this, will it eventually halt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=5069" target="_blank">01:24:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">or will it loop forever? That's called the halting problem. This turns out to be like a really,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=5073" target="_blank">01:24:33.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this is a mathematically significant problem because they were trying to understand this problem of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=5079" target="_blank">01:24:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">does there exist a machine that can tell if there's a proof for every, there's this, there's this whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=5083" target="_blank">01:24:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">thing about mechanically computing proofs for math problems, but that, because it's before computers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=5089" target="_blank">01:24:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">so put that aside. He pretty easily proved that can't be solved. And he did it by contradiction. He said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=5094" target="_blank">01:24:54.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like, let's assume you had a program that could always solve that. I'm going to use that as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=5098" target="_blank">01:24:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">subroutine in another program that contradicts itself. So like that was the very first problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKSf03Z_uc&t=5103" target="_blank">01:25:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we identified that couldn't be solved.
