In order for me to do that effectively, I have to know that that is the kind of information of a specific format that I'm looking for, and so I have a note for that, and I have my brain kind of passively as I'm looking through things, not just like willy-nilly being like, "this is interesting, let me throw it in here, this is interesting, let me bookmark it." It's specifically looking for that kind of information of that format.</p><p>So what that means is then when I'm operating around the web, I'm filtering myself, which means that my "second brain," which again, Evernote notion, you can use whatever tool you want, is organized in a way that I don't have to go back and clean it up and kind of wonder like, "what am I going to do with all this information?" I have almost like a project, a mandate of what what I'm looking for and how it's going to be used later.</p></div></div></body></html>
