those discussions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1646" target="_blank">00:27:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You'll see that there's a summary of the existing discussion at the start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1649" target="_blank">00:27:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So you may find that what you need is already in the question and answers there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="t">The other thing you may find helpful is that each lesson has a timeline on the wiki and those hyperlinks are actually hyperlinks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1674" target="_blank">00:27:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Directly to the part of the video which discusses that topic</span></div><div

works</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1680" target="_blank">00:28:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You can just click on that link and you'll jump straight to me telling you about momentum</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1685" target="_blank">00:28:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">As Rachel said there's also a number of resources available to help you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1692" target="_blank">00:28:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is taken from the front page of our wiki</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1695" target="_blank">00:28:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a whole section of tools with links where you can learn about learn more about each of the pieces that we use in the development</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1701" target="_blank">00:28:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Environment and so our goal here is not to be a single source of truth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1705" target="_blank">00:28:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If somebody else has already done a great job of teaching one of these tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1709" target="_blank">00:28:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll leave it to them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1710" target="_blank">00:28:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So we don't attempt to give you a great bash reference or a great umpire reference because people have already done that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1717"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1722" target="_blank">00:28:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And you'll find some curated resources that we think are really helpful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1726" target="_blank">00:28:46.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So this lesson</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1729" target="_blank">00:28:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to cover a lot of stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1732" target="_blank">00:28:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But these are the four things to keep in mind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1734" target="_blank">00:28:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">By the end of the lesson you want to make sure that you can create an AWS instance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1738" target="_blank">00:28:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That you can connect to it with SSH</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1741" target="_blank">00:29:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It can run a Jupyter notebook in it and you can run those that state-of-the-art custom model code that we showed you earlier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1748" target="_blank">00:29:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Those first three things you're going to be doing every single project in every single lesson</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1754" target="_blank">00:29:14.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're going to want to be really comfortable at doing that and for those of you who don't I haven't done that before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1759" target="_blank">00:29:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It might take you a little while to get the hang of it and maybe a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1762" target="_blank">00:29:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">unsuccessful attempts first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1765" target="_blank">00:29:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So this first lessons unusual and that it's a lot more about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1769" target="_blank">00:29:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Kind of getting your development environment set up and not as much about deep learning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1773" target="_blank">00:29:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So indeed if you've got a background in Python and AWS and Linux</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1779" target="_blank">00:29:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You may find this lesson on the easy side in which case you can dip through it pretty fast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1783" target="_blank">00:29:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">If you don't have a background in these tools today's class may seem really overwhelming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1788" target="_blank">00:29:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And we don't don't want you to be discouraged by that because this is very different from the future lessons</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1793" target="_blank">00:29:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's necessary to get your environment set up so that you can be coding throughout the course</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1798" target="_blank">00:29:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean the folks who didn't have that background in the in-person course once they actually got through this and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1804" target="_blank">00:30:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Often it was a lot of work and it was pretty tough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1806" target="_blank">00:30:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But at the end they finally got the point and they could say, okay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzt3-FHdAeM&t=1809" target="_blank">00:30:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I've set up a GPU instance in the
