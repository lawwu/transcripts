And you compare that to the speech that President Barack Obama gave eight years later when he signed Dodd-Frank into law in the Rose Garden, and it's remarkably similar, that now ordinary investors can count on the rules and regulations keeping themselves from people who are preying on their financial well-being.</p><p>And I don't think it's true in either case because our markets, particularly modern markets, move and evolve so quickly that the thing that's coming out of La Sille to get you is never going to be the thing you were protecting against.</p></div></div></body></html>
