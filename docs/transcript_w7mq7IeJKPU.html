What can people do? Because it seems like a lot of parents carry a tremendous amount of burden and stress about trying to make sure their kid has every opportunity, gets the perfect school, gets the perfect this.</p><p>The amount of control you have over your kid's success and outcomes is quite a bit less than many of us think. So the corollary of a lot of the choices we make probably don't matter as much as we think is that, you know, you could do everything right, even if that were a thing.</p><p>And then your kid might not turn out to be an Olympic athlete like you had hoped or whatever was your was your dream. And that loss of control, that's I think really that's really hard for a lot of people.
