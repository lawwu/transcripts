I am a software engineer by profession and I've been following your books for quite a long time now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=13" target="_blank">00:00:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My question is regarding your time block planner. I was wondering if you were to update, you are going to update to a new version with a spiral binding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because I read a lot of reviews on Amazon that the spiral binding would make it even more easy to use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you have more updates coming to your time block planner soon? Please keep me updated. Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Good question, timely question. So we have a collection of changes that we are preparing for the next generation of time block planners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Full life flat or significantly improved life flat is part of it. There's some changes I'm doing to the actual configuration of the pages inside the planner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's going to give us more days worth of planning without having to actually make the planner much thicker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a few other things too that are on this list I've been working with my publisher on to get ready for the next generation of time block planners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here is the main thing that stands between us right now and generation two of the time block planners is that we printed a lot of the first generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We printed tens of thousands of copies of this planner. Now we've also sold tens of thousands of copies of the planner so it's good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're catching up to the supply, but we can't put out a new generation of the planner until we basically have moved through the first generation that we've already printed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I want to try to tell people who are using a time block planner now, this thing will continually be updated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The slowest update is going to be this first one because the first printing of anything is going to be the biggest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">After this first printing, printings will probably be smaller so we can get changes into the pipeline quicker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you are not investing when you buy this planner, when you start doing time block planning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you're not investing in the exact version of the planner you receive in the mail as being what you will be using from here on out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Over time, this planner will evolve based on feedback.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're investing in a system. You're investing in an approach to managing your time, not just a physical product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because once you fill that one planner, you get another one, and then you get another one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the next one might be different because we're going to continue to evolve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I do like to tell people that, you know, every three months you're done with one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Pretty soon the next one you get might be different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this seems very self-serving, but it's true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The best thing you can do to help introduce or accelerate improvements to the planner is actually to keep using the planner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're using time block planning, and maybe there's some changes you want to see,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">keep using time block planning because if everyone bought one more, we get through six months more,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and everyone's bought two more, that's going to get us all the more quicker to the printing selling out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so we can get the new changes into the pipeline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, I know that sounds really self-serving, but this is the bigger point I want to make is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">when you buy the time block planner, it's not the one thing you get.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It is an investment in a new philosophy of scheduling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you don't know what we're talking about, we do have that website, timeblockplanner.com,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=208"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So yes, changes are coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">After those changes, there'll be more, and after those, there will, I'm sure, be more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa2r1f3r5nw&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This will continue to
