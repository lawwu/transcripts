Maybe they probably would have been talking about spreading various religious beliefs. And I think it would have seemed crazy to think that what you should be thinking about, for example, was the steam engine and how that might change the world.</p><p>But I think the Industrial Revolution was actually just an enormous deal and probably was the right thing to be thinking about, if there's any way to be thinking about it. If there was any way to be thinking about how that would change the world and what one might do to make that a world that could be better.</p><p>So that's basically where I'm at on this stuff, is I just think as a world, as a global civilization, we should have a really high priority on just saying, "We live in a weird time. Growth has been exploding, accelerating over the last blink of an eye. We really need to be nervous and vigilant about what comes next and thinking about all the things that could radically transform the world.</p></div></div></body></html>
