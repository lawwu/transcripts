(upbeat music) - This is insane. (upbeat music) - This is really incredible actually. (upbeat music) - I don't agree with everything you say guys. I do learn something new every time. - It's a good compromise. You guys are gonna look like a winner.</p><p>- I can't brainstorm this right now 'cause I've had three glasses of tequila and two beers. But I will tell you, I think that the best thing that we can do is have the conversation. - Of course. - And I appreciate you doing that. (upbeat music) - Really too slumpy, honestly.</p><p>- Well, you can open the top button and flip this up. - Here, let me see. - You have a nice watch on? - No, not like you. Just let me borrow your watch for the day and you don't wear a watch. - Yeah, you want it? - No.</p><p>- Does it look better, you think, tucked in? Jim wants a call. - Yeah. - Is it allowed to sit on your belt? - This looks better. It looks less like you. (upbeat music) - Stacks, we're about to start. If you have any pull on this guy, please get him sooner.</p><p>- Hello. - He's not showing up until 9.59. - I know. - I told you this. - Yes. - He's barely gonna show up. - I'm sorry, he says. Okay, great. - Doubt it. Can we get him, Mike? (upbeat music) - He's going to show up at the absolute last minute.</p><p>- 9.45. - He did it again last year. - Same thing? - Yeah. (upbeat music) - We will explain how we upstage in two minutes. - Yeah. - All right, will you be ready? - Yeah. - Okay, perfect. Thank you. - There he is. - Hey, brothers. - Oh, yeah.</p><p>- I didn't come any earlier. - Stacks is here, your man. Oh, 9.59, you just got here. - Guys, we're running a tight shift. - Let's get it ready. Come on, guys, you ready? Let's do it. - Stacks. - Give me that energy. - Wish not. (upbeat music) - And now, give it up for your besties.</p><p>(audience cheering) (upbeat music) - Welcome to LA. (audience cheering) - Anybody fly in over 10 hours to get here. - If Jason hadn't stolen all the money, we could have given you guys something to eat. (laughing) - Don't worry, guys, I'll take care of the parties. - Unbelievable. - Pretty great.</p><p>- Make sure you get your empty lunch bag when you walk outside, guys. (laughing) - So, first off, please join me in welcoming Ray Dalio to the stage. - Wow. (audience cheering) We got Ray Dalio. - I think the basic picture in China, the United States, the emergence of India, and so on, is the world order's gonna change in a very profound way.</p><p>- When a rapidly rising power seriously threatens to displace a ruling power, shit happens. (audience cheering) - 25 years from now, I think the need to work will disappear. AI will cause great abundance, but meaning for human beings will be the largest problem we face. - I think we're at an incredible inflection point, and we all need to be open-minded and understand that, like, the train has left the station.</p><p>- So, it's like, we are, at every moment, we are made of different atoms of space, yet we believe that it's the same us at every successive moment. I think AI is sort of, AI is very limited in the computational universe. The computational universe is all these possible rules.</p><p>We're gonna talk about whether the, I hope we're gonna talk about whether the physical universe-- - We are gonna talk about the universe and the nature of the universe, which is, we're gonna talk about consciousness, and we're gonna smoke weed, and then we're gonna go to lunch, but. (laughing) (gentle music) - So, that's like the number one thing.</p><p>I want it, this Thai beef salad is the number one thing in LA. Do you want the Thai beef salad? - Yeah, whatever you recommend. Thank you, sir. - I can have another Thai beef salad. - Hey, is it important? What do you recommend? - The Thai beef salad.</p><p>- Fuck, this is great, look at this. Wow. - I swear to God, when you meet the guys in the audience, that's what's amazing. They're like fucking real grinders. They're like all business people. They've all done something. They've all taken risks. It's really inspiring. (gentle music) (dramatic music) - The fusion reaction, the reaction that happens inside all the stars, it's actually the most prevalent reaction in the entire universe.</p><p>What we're trying to do is we're trying to take that reaction and put it in a bottle, in a machine that we can build here, and that we can build quickly. - Is there pressure to tone down like the consumerism or the giving away money? - No, not really, to be honest.</p><p>Most people think it's cool 'cause it's like, it's kind of fun to watch someone receive $10,000 or a Lamborghini or a house. Like the last thing we did was I ordered pizza and tipped the guy a house. And like, I thought that was cool. (audience applauding) - We've got a great party for you tonight.</p><p>Obviously, Santa Monica Pier. It's gonna be a little crazy, so get there early. (upbeat music) - Barbie party is this way, welcome to. (upbeat music) (scatting) - So I'll be talking about engineering viruses to go after brain cancer. (upbeat music) (scatting) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (scatting) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) - You guys are probably gonna be-- - Nikki or Nicole?</p><p>- You're saying Nikki, Nikki. - I've called her Nikki in the past, but I can't remember if I'm fucking that up. - Nikki, unless I text you, I will ask her. - Do not put this in the fucking video. Only make him look good, only. No authenticity whatsoever. We don't want any authenticity in this video.</p><p>(upbeat music) - How many of you are short on sleep? Every one of you, raise your hands, come on. So there is a rare mutation that happens in patients, these are people walking amongst us, who have a mutation in a gene called DEC2. These patients only need four hours of sleep a night to be completely rested the same way that we have the need for eight to nine hours of sleep a night.</p><p>Are you interested in getting this gene therapy? We could do this today. - The reason I picked this title is Silicon Valley's 2,851 miles away from Washington, and as these people put their eyes towards us, I would state the following. The reason Silicon Valley's been so successful is because it's so fucking far away from Washington, D.C.</p><p>(audience applauding) Thank you. - Luxury beliefs have, to a large extent, replaced luxury goods. A core feature of a luxury belief is that the believer is comfortably insulated from the consequences of his or her belief. - Jenny, thanks so much for joining us here at the awarding conference. - Thank you.</p><p>(audience applauding) - I didn't realize there's so many skills that men are learning at a very young age that women are not. They're learning strategy, they're learning capital allocation, they're learning just how to take risks, fail, and get back in the game. I've been playing poker as a business person my whole life, I just didn't know it.</p><p>(hip hop music) ♪ I can do this with my eyes closed ♪ ♪ We forgot nothin' on my goals ♪ ♪ My girl ain't plastic, she don't even recycle ♪ ♪ All these kids just wanna be idols ♪ ♪ All these kids just wanna be rival ♪ ♪ I need somethin' way more than viral ♪ ♪ I need somethin' way more than viral ♪ ♪ Gotta be somethin' way more than idol ♪ ♪ Careful not to get too close ♪ ♪ I might just go ♪ ♪ We like to, we like to go ♪ ♪ We like to, we like to, we like to go ♪ ♪ Might just go ♪ - We don't need Sax, he's not gonna add anything to the side shit.</p><p>Fuck Sax, let him sleep. Get him some fuckin' coffee. I mean, for real. He was out last night with Drake, I think. Oh, look, look what the cat dragged in. Oh. - Yeah, I was busy last night writing an op-ed. What did you do? - Oh, oh, it's 9.59, I can set my watch.</p><p>- I read it. - I didn't see it. Who'd you write it for? - Elon. - There's an article in Today's New Yorker calling you a super villain, because you're advocating peace and protecting the First Amendment. I mean, it's like completely upside down. - Do you want people to eat their vegetables?</p><p>- At this point, you literally cannot sell actual press from parody. - This session is like my fucking nightmare, because I'm so frustrated with Chess, I gotta be honest. Just sitting here and getting embarrassed in front of everyone and putting it on the fuckin' internet, it's like. - Okay, check.</p><p>- What? The fuck? - I can't focus on you anymore. - Oh, Jesus Christ, you're such an asshole. God, this is like fuckin' 20 years of our friendship right there. That's exactly. - You know, let's have term limits for members of Congress and Senators. Let's not have any corporate PAC money, or any PAC money, any lobbyists.</p><p>And also, ban members of Congress from becoming lobbyists. This was common sense things. - I mean, listen, I think this is the most eclectic and interesting group of speakers that any conference of the year pulls together. Yeah, we have problems in the world. Graham will say, "Destined for war." Ray Dalio will say, "Fall of an empire." Well, part of what they're doing is sending us a warning.</p><p>But the great thing about America, like, we have agency. We get together every week and we have this conversation because we actually think you can do something about these things, right? And talking about it is critical to doing something about these things. I'm hitting the head. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - He looks like fucking Blade Runner.</p><p>That's awesome.
