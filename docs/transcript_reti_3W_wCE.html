Let's see here. What do we got next, Jesse? All right. Next question we got from Mika, and he asked, "Does listening to a podcast count as reading?" No, I don't count it the same. I think these are two different classes of intellectual substance that you're ingesting. Here's the quick way I discern between the two. So when you're reading a book, you're ingesting a fully formed, carefully thought through thought structure. And we're talking nonfiction here. But you have a writer who has really thought something through. It might be their lifelong expertise or something they researched deeply. They spent a long time trying to organize these thoughts into a structure that is internally coherent and makes sense and has been validated. So when you're reading a good nonfiction book, you can basically take this well-crafted thought structure and just graft it onto your cognitive framework. Oh, now I understand, you know, the influence of cryptocurrency on whatever. Yeah, currency markets. Plug that in. Podcast, it's more conversational. I think of podcast as a source of the type of material with which you could build one of these structured thoughts, right? Or I might learn a bunch of interesting stuff from a podcast, but there's still a lot of work to be done probably to take the various things I heard in this interview or got out of this conversation and mix it with things I've learned elsewhere and build it together into a coherent thought. To build it together into something I could write 10,000 words on or write a book about. So you're getting raw thought stuff on podcast than in books. That's why I think about it differently. It's also why it's less cognitively demanding to listen to a podcast. You can zone in and out, be in conversational mode. And when you hear something interesting, then pay attention and sort of collect that for use later. So I see it as being different things. The exception, of course, is this podcast. Nothing about this is raw. This is all finely honed intellectual material. My proposal, and I think this is reasonable, is that listening to this podcast should legally be equivalent to being awarded a doctorate from an accredited university. And that's just one man's opinion. What's your view on podcasts versus music? Different things. Music's an aesthetic experience. Especially if you have music appreciation, either it's an appreciation experience, like I just really enjoy this musician, or it's kind of like a neurotropic experience. I'm working out and I want to whatever, just get fired up. Or it's just want to get lost or listen to something funny, like mood alteration. So it's like an aesthetic experience, mood alteration. I think it's different than information ingestion. So I count them differently.</p></div></div></body></html>
