Okay. Maybe it's not going to take you 10 years to get to five. Maybe it's going to take you 20 years. Maybe it's going to take you how, how many every year? So it almost doesn't even matter, but your life is vastly better.</p><p>That first time you have $5,000 saved up even $1,000, right? Like, cause how many people live paycheck to paycheck and think that an emergency is a $200 expense that came out of the blue, but was perfectly foreseeable in a given year, but that to them is, is an emergency, but it's really not right.</p><p>Like, it's just life is lumpy. Expenses are lumpy. That's the way it works. But man, that first time they have a thousand bucks saved up, $5,000 saved up, like their life is dramatically better. That power starts accruing from day one. I think it's, it really radically transforms people and their entire mindset.</p></div></div></body></html>
