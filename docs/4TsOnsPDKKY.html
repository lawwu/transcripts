started climbing when I was a child,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.480</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">But then, you know, now as a professional climber,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously there is that extrinsic motivation as well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think with the film "Free Solo", you know,</span></div><div

even if no one else in the world existed, I'd want to do this thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But then you also know that if you're, if the film turns out well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">at which it did, you know, it's going to be great for your career.</span></div><div

well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so then you're always trying to parse out like which part is which.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.640</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:04:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't want to be too extrinsically motivated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

being extrinsically motivated,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you can

<span class="t">I mean, but you're just constantly thinking about those things as a climber.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">In order to "Free Solo" El Cap, did you memorize sequences?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Or is it more sort of like motifs where you kind of know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that you're going to do any number of different things in a given pitch?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It depends.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So for the hardest parts, I memorized like for sure, memorize every aspect of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's only the hardest part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's maybe like a third of the route.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then for the easiest third, and some of it is actually quite easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of it's like even a non-climber could climb small sections of the wall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Like there are parts that are quite easy here and there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it's like not the bulk, but, but so for the easy parts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you just know that you can do it and you don't have to stress it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the, the medium part's kind of like the remaining third of the wall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You sort of remember kind of like you said, motifs, like you might know the hardest part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and you just kind of know that it's going to be fine, but you don't have to memorize it per se.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But certainly I knew the route very, very well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you just, you just know all the things that you have to know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You recognize not just holds, but like visceral sensations, like this feels different or,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">because I imagine conditions change, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, weather conditions, heat on the rock, shadows on the rock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, but not as much as you might think, because like I was only climbing in shade,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like in the springtime, the, that whole west side of the wall stays in the shade until 11 or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">noonish in the morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So you go at four in the morning and then you have sort of eight hours of solid shade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So normally the temperature and the, the conditions feel relatively stable and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">spend the whole season working on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So you kind of know that tomorrow is going to feel the same as it did today, roughly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's all within a relatively narrow band, particularly in the spring,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">which is why I did it in the springtime in the, in the fall and the autumn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a little bit different because the sun is lower in the sky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So it gets sun much earlier and it actually is way hotter counterintuitively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like colder when it's in the shade, but then hotter when it's in the sun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And anyways, that makes it harder for climbing, obviously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But when I free solo at El Cap, I was spending three or four months a year in Yosemite every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">year, like, you know, a month or two every spring and every, every autumn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you're spending four months a year in a place.</span></div><div

early.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You're used to climbing on the

Like it's just not playing basketball or something. Yeah. I'm intrigued by the training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1386" target="_blank">00:23:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">aspects and some of the fitness aspects. I agree that it, I'm having only done it a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1390" target="_blank">00:23:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I've been to a climbing gym once or twice. Yeah. I was going to have, so you've gone to the gym</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1393" target="_blank">00:23:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and stuff. Yeah, I've gone up and down the wall a few times. I've belayed for people a few times,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but I am by no means, you know, skilled at it. It'd be fun to get into, because I, happy birthday,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1402" target="_blank">00:23:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">by the way, I just turned 40. I'm turning 50 soon. And I think more about, I'm happy with my strength</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and endurance, but I think more about mobility now. And also climbing is great for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Climbing is great for that. And, and there's a lot of interesting literature on brain longevity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1417" target="_blank">00:23:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and just maintaining your cognition and the strength of your, of your distal body. So toes and fingers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">believe it or not, it's a correlate. Like, yeah, isn't that, isn't that, I've always thought that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1427" target="_blank">00:23:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">just a correlation. It's just a correlation. Because yeah, like, because grip strength is just a proxy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for all, like it means that you use your body a lot. And so therefore you're probably,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1436" target="_blank">00:23:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, like when I read those things about like, if you have strong grip, it means this and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1439" target="_blank">00:23:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">this and this, I'm like, no, if you have a strong grip, it means that you do stuff all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1443" target="_blank">00:24:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as a result of doing stuff all the time, you're probably sharper than, than somebody who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">doesn't do stuff all the time. That's right. So it's a correlate. Um, at the same time, the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1451" target="_blank">00:24:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the motor neurons that control like trunk movements and contraction of the trunk muscles,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">like, as you go out from the midline, they are, they're in layers in the spinal cord. So they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">literally like the, the muscle, the motor neurons that control like the core sit closer to the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">sit closer to, in the spinal cord to the midline. And then, you know, across evolution, like, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1470" target="_blank">00:24:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">we evolved from animals with fins and, and wings and some of the same genes are used. And eventually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1474" target="_blank">00:24:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you get motor neurons that control like fine motor movements like this. And it is true that for some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1479" target="_blank">00:24:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">reason, the motor neurons that control the, the distal body, so toes and fingers, calves and forearms</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1485" target="_blank">00:24:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">are more vulnerable to age related degeneration than the ones for the, for the core. So by, so it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1491" target="_blank">00:24:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">possible, we don't know yet that by maintaining strength of the, of the distal body that you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1496" target="_blank">00:24:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">actually, um, preserve motor neuron and cognitive function. And I'm freaking, I'm psyched.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1501" target="_blank">00:25:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're set. And that's why I was curious how climbers provided they don't fall and kill themselves,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1506" target="_blank">00:25:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">how they age. Um, and there's other things here too, because like in some sports like football</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1510" target="_blank">00:25:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and rugby, people are getting their hit, head hit a lot. So you don't tend to age well, but I always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">thought of climbers, you know, in my time up in Yosemite, I'd see young guys like you and I'd see these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1519" target="_blank">00:25:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like old, like these old climbers.

They're lean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">they're live, they, they seem cognitively fresh. So it seems like it's a sport where people hold on to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1529" target="_blank">00:25:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">their faculties pretty well. Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think, um, you know, it's hard to say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1534" target="_blank">00:25:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">cause there just aren't that many super old climbers.

I mean, I have a bunch of friends</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1551" target="_blank">00:25:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">who are sort of fifties and sixties who are very fit.

So with climbing in general, like if you go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1826" target="_blank">00:30:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">climbing with a rope, uh, like if you're traditional climbing, like you're climbing with a rope and gear,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1831" target="_blank">00:30:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and you're going to climb half dome, let's say, when you start climbing from the ground, you go some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1835" target="_blank">00:30:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">distance before you put your first piece of gear in, because that's just kind of the nature of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1838" target="_blank">00:30:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">climbing. You go for a ways and you put in some gear, you clip your rope into it, and then you're protected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1841" target="_blank">00:30:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then for whatever distance you're going, you're essentially free soloing to that point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1846" target="_blank">00:30:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, like there's always risk involved in climbing, because even if you have a rope on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1849" target="_blank">00:30:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">depending how far you're going above your last piece of gear and, you know, what the train is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1853" target="_blank">00:30:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like and whether or not the rock is good and all these other factors, you know, you're more or less</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">safe. And so I think people look at free soloing as like this binary, like if you don't have a rope,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1861" target="_blank">00:31:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that's dangerous. And you're kind of like, well, anytime you're climbing, there are dangers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1865" target="_blank">00:31:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">or there could be, and you're constantly evaluating those and trying to mitigate them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1870" target="_blank">00:31:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that's, that's the big misperception because easy free soloing is probably like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1875" target="_blank">00:31:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">if I'm somebody, you know, who's like an expert rock climber or whatever, I've been climbing 30 years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1880" target="_blank">00:31:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">if I'm on an easy free solo, that's almost certainly safer than a very hard,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1884" target="_blank">00:31:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">certain types of hard climbing with a rope on, you know, and most of my scariest experience as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1889" target="_blank">00:31:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">climber actually have been with a rope on, because with a rope, you're much more willing to push</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=1893" target="_blank">00:31:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">yourself into unknown terrain.

And then it's like, what do you do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2553" target="_blank">00:42:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">with the rest of your time?

That said, I think if you want to be a great free</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2568" target="_blank">00:42:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">solist or like a big adventure climber, you're probably better off living in a van and just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2573" target="_blank">00:42:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">doing the thing nonstop because for that, you're not trying to have that peak muscular performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2580" target="_blank">00:43:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You're trying to just learn a skill and do something all the time. And so then like hours of practice,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2585" target="_blank">00:43:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I think matter more. Anyway, maybe we talk a little bit about recovery as long as we're talking about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2590" target="_blank">00:43:10.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, number of hours that one puts in. I'm sure your recovery looks different than it used to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2595" target="_blank">00:43:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But what, what do you do to recover between sessions? Are you a big believer in sauna, cold?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2602" target="_blank">00:43:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it just basically sleep? No, I like push my three-year-old on the swings, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2606" target="_blank">00:43:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like that's how it recovers. I like play with the kids on the swings and, and I try to, I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2611" target="_blank">00:43:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, I try to eat relatively well. I try to sleep enough. Like I do all the basics for recovery,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2616" target="_blank">00:43:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but, um, but no, I mean, I basically just survive in between. I was actually just joking with somebody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2621" target="_blank">00:43:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that I think, you know, as a, as a 24 year old living by myself in a van, I would have crazy days</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2627" target="_blank">00:43:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of climbing. And then on a rest day, I would like binge watch an entire season of some show while</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2631" target="_blank">00:43:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">eating an entire flat Oreos, just like never even leave the bed of my van. And then the next day go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2635" target="_blank">00:43:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">out and like do a speed record on something and just be like, I'm so psyched, you know? And now I'm like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2640" target="_blank">00:44:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm definitely not doing that now or at least no, I haven't done that in forever. Cause I just don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2645" target="_blank">00:44:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">have the time and don't have, um, yeah. So I think now it takes a little more effort to recover</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2650" target="_blank">00:44:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's just a little slower probably. But it's hard to say though, because a lot of that's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2655" target="_blank">00:44:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">having kids and just having different demands of, of time in life. But it sounds like climbers are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2660" target="_blank">00:44:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">are pretty, uh, grassroots in their, in their training and techniques. Like, you know, in a lot of other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2665" target="_blank">00:44:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">areas. Yeah. I mean, I was living in a van. I was basically like, you know, super low overhead,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2670" target="_blank">00:44:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">no, no team, no support. I'm just living in a car doing the thing nonstop for, uh, you know, a decade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2675" target="_blank">00:44:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that's a pretty scrappy approach. And I think that, that in the years since then climbing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2682" target="_blank">00:44:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is professionalized a little bit and there's a little more money, there's a little more support</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2685" target="_blank">00:44:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and there's just a higher level of competition. I think, um, it'd be harder to, to achieve things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2690" target="_blank">00:44:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">doing just that now. I think you'd have to have a little more of a plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2693" target="_blank">00:44:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I can't help, but sense that hyperbaric chambers and red light and massage guns and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2698" target="_blank">00:44:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">all that are going to be making their way into the climate culture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2700" target="_blank">00:45:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, massage guns for sure are there.

I tried to like roll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2704" target="_blank">00:45:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">out every once in a while, even when I was living in my van, I would stretch and roll out and those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2707" target="_blank">00:45:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">types of things.

How's your body feel?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2711" target="_blank">00:45:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I mean, right now I think pretty good. I don't know. Yeah. When I'm, um, I live in Las Vegas,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2717" target="_blank">00:45:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">when I'm at home, I try to see this body worker in town once a week, Pat, sweet Pat, he's the man.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2721" target="_blank">00:45:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, uh, you know, I think of that as kind of like a basic, just taking care of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2727" target="_blank">00:45:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, you know, making, it's like an oil change.

Actually, Danny Wei jumped the Great Wall of China. He was kind of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2755" target="_blank">00:45:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">first person in skateboarding to like, he would do like neck training because he had broken his neck</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=2759" target="_blank">00:45:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">surfing in Newport.

It's not that hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3260" target="_blank">00:54:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But then we got there and it was, it was like the worst condition. It was like 86 degrees and we parked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3264" target="_blank">00:54:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the car. And so, you know, it's like you're trying to work out and like horrendously hot. And it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3269" target="_blank">00:54:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">also that kind of monsoony. So it was very humid. So we got to the wall and it's like disgusting. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3273" target="_blank">00:54:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I was kind of like, well, you know, it's a training day, like whatever. And so I tried to do this new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3277" target="_blank">00:54:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">combination of routes. Ultimately, I failed on, I felt the very freaking top of the wall. I was like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3280" target="_blank">00:54:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">so maxed and didn't do it.

Um, but you know, it's like a very small goal. Like this isn't cutting edge,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3290" target="_blank">00:54:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like big, this isn't, this isn't even cool at all.

You do like enough little things all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3322" target="_blank">00:55:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">time. And then every once in a while something big happens. And so I don't know that's, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3328" target="_blank">00:55:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but I have to do lists going back like years of like goals and all these aspirations. And you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3332" target="_blank">00:55:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">some years I only do half of them, some years I do a third of them. And then, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3336" target="_blank">00:55:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">something like free selling all cap sat on a list like that literally for years. And it kept floating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3340" target="_blank">00:55:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to the next year, to the next year. Cause you get into Yosemite, you look at the wall and you're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3344" target="_blank">00:55:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">nah, that's, you know, you're like, it's totally out of the question.

Sometimes they do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3352" target="_blank">00:55:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">but you kind of just have to let it play out.

I had an air failure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3509" target="_blank">00:58:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">while in the cage. I was on that hookah line and I was alone in the cage when it happened. And I'll tell you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3513" target="_blank">00:58:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that was a lot more terrifying than being out of the cage with the sharks. Because when you're out of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3516" target="_blank">00:58:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">cage, you're on scuba and you have some degree of control over, you know, you can shoot for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3520" target="_blank">00:58:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">surface.

Like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3574" target="_blank">00:59:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the, the obvious visual thing is probably not the, the, the big challenge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3579" target="_blank">00:59:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And it sounds a little cliche, but you're doing what you love.

He seemed to have some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3712" target="_blank">01:01:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">sense of how long he was going to live and really wanted to pack things in.

But barring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3720" target="_blank">01:02:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">accident or injury, you know, we don't really know when we're going to die. But sometimes I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3725" target="_blank">01:02:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, we get the sense based on relatives and, you know, I can remember a time in my life when I,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3730" target="_blank">01:02:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of course I knew I was going to die, but I lived in a way that I just, I felt like I had all the time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=3735" target="_blank">01:02:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in the world despite pursuing things.

And so now I've just taken, you know, whatever,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=4090" target="_blank">01:08:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like 30, 35 semesters off or something.

And so I thought it was just kind of a fun thing. I was doing in the van for a while</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=4214" target="_blank">01:10:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">before I'd like find some kind of job or something. And then thankfully the climbing industry is kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=4220" target="_blank">01:10:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of scaled at the same rate that, that, that I did as a climber. And so it, it all worked out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=4226" target="_blank">01:10:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it the case that, um, you didn't have, uh, any monetary aspirations when you were doing it? Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=4233" target="_blank">01:10:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it sounds like you, you didn't, but, um, did you ever have the conversation with your mom?

No. Well, so, I mean, I mentioned that my dad died,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=4242" target="_blank">01:10:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">so my parents had just gotten divorced.

I'm just like, I don't know what that is, but, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=4251" target="_blank">01:10:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">so I was making like a couple hundred bucks a month in bonds. And then, uh, I stole the family minivan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=4257" target="_blank">01:10:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I said, my grandparent and my two grandfathers had died before. So like, basically my mom had inherited this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=4262" target="_blank">01:11:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">little car that, so she was driving my grandpa's car.

I was making a couple hundred bucks in bonds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=4267" target="_blank">01:11:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And basically that just kind of covered any of the pressure, like the financial pressure,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=4271" target="_blank">01:11:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">whereas like that gave me enough of a buffer that I was like, well, for several years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=4274" target="_blank">01:11:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">at least I can just kind of like live in this minivan and see what happens. And then after a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=4279" target="_blank">01:11:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">couple of years I was sponsored, I was getting free product. I was getting it like a very,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=4283" target="_blank">01:11:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">very small amount of money, but some amount of money, which is enough to sort of justify the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=4287" target="_blank">01:11:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">whole thing.

But yeah, I mean, I mean, that's one of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=4296" target="_blank">01:11:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">ways in which I was very lucky as a climber, you know, there was like just enough financial cushion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=4300" target="_blank">01:11:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that I could try to do the thing as much as I wanted for a couple of years and see how it played</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=4304" target="_blank">01:11:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">out.

that's climbing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=4842" target="_blank">01:20:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in a

And it's not cold anymore. You're just like this sun. So you get this like breath of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=6147" target="_blank">01:42:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">fresh air and then you just keep grinding.

If, if not then forgive me. Speaking of Berkeley, there was a laboratory at Berkeley that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=6224" target="_blank">01:43:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">wanted to understand how geckos could walk up walls. And for a long time, it was thought that it was like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=6228" target="_blank">01:43:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">suction of some sort, but then it turns out they could do it in a vacuum. So it means that it can't be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=6234" target="_blank">01:43:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">suction. It turns out they have these little pedals on their, on their fingertips and they can push those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=6241" target="_blank">01:44:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">pedals.

They can push them so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=6247" target="_blank">01:44:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">close to the surface that they're climbing that they use what are called van der Waal forces,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TsOnsPDKKY&t=6251" target="_blank">01:44:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">which is the exchange of molecules between the surface and those pedals.
