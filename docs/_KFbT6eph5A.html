Not too long ago, I made a game with 100% AI-generated content.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=30" target="_blank">00:00:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a simple game where you're wandering around lost in the forest, and you go from scene to scene</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">having encounters that impact your vigor and your courage.

There's 16 scenes in a 4x4 grid, and so if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.140</a></span> | <span class="t">play a few times, you will have seen them all. Now, my favorite part of making this game</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">was generating each scene and just seeing what AI would come up with. And I thought,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">wouldn't it be cool to share that experience with the player? What if every time they went to a new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">scene, it was generated fresh for them, and every game would be unique and different this way? It would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">be a game of infinite exploration. That sounded so cool that I wanted to try to do it. Now, the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that I would need to do is to generate each scene and have a consistent way of doing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">My scene definitions are JSON objects that describe what the scene is when you first find it, as well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">as when you come back to it later, and how that impacts your stats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So I started out by using OpenAI's completion endpoint and doing some prompt engineering.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the prompt that I used. This is a very detailed prompt. It's rather long, but it worked really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">well. Most of the time, I would get scenes that had the right JSON format and the content was good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It was fitting. It was varied. It was interesting. So I was happy with this. But I wanted to make it even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">more reliable. And I decided to fine-tune a model. I used OpenAI's fine-tuning endpoint, and they recommend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">50 to 100 examples. I generated 50 examples, just like these, and used them to fine-tune.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the key is I shortened the prompt. I simplified it. I took out any of the JSON and just generally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">described what I wanted, hoping that that information would be embedded in the training data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And I tried this out. I wasn't sure if it would work. And I tried it. It only cost about a dollar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">or two. That includes generating all the examples and doing the fine-tuning. And when I tried it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I was very happy to find that it worked perfectly. Even though I didn't mention the JSON at all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it came out perfect because of what was in the examples. And that meant I had less tokens in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">prompt, which is faster and cheaper and just easier to work with. So I was really pleased with how this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">worked. The next step was to make the images. Now, I used a tool called Leonardo. Leonardo not only lets you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">generate images. They also let you create your own image models. And this is great for a game because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it means that you can have stylistically consistent images, which is exactly what I needed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So I spent a while using all the different parameters that Leonardo offers and working with the prompt to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">try and find an image that looked right and that I liked. It turned out that using the description</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">directly from the scene as the prompt made nice pictures, which I was surprised about since it had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like second person and said things other than what was in there, but it worked out great. Now, the tricky part with fine-tuning an image model is that you need consistent images that have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like the parts that should be the same are the same in all of your training data, but the parts that you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to vary need to be varied. Otherwise, it will overfit and all of your images will look the same. But if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">don't have that consistency between them, then it won't really know what you want and you won't get that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">good stylistic consistency. This was really tricky, especially in my case. I needed the perspective and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">scale to be consistent from scene to scene. Obviously, I needed them all to be set in the forest and I wanted to have this overall tone and texture that looked the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of my scenes have people in them, some have animals, some have buildings, some have nothing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and so it was hard to get that variety. I ended up having to train a couple of models with different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">parameters, different sets of images, but I eventually found one that worked out. And to test it out, I generated a lot of images. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a whole bunch. And you can see they all have similar features like the zigzag path down the middle. Obviously, the trees and look and everything looks the same. And yet, there's plenty of variety. Each one is unique and different, but still feels cohesive, which I am very pleased about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So now I had everything I needed to put it together and make the game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I made a simple asset server that had an AI pipeline, starting by requesting a new scene from OpenAI's endpoint using my custom model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Once I get that, I validate the JSON to make sure that it's got all the keys it needs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">If it's good, I take the description and I send that to Leonardo. Leonardo makes an image from my custom model, gives it back to me. I put it all together and send it off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, did this work? Well, let me show you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Here is an example scene that was created.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm very happy with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I made a simple preview server so that I could scroll through a bunch of these scenes that I generated to make sure they worked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And it looked good. So I made some changes to the game to request images each time the player went to a new scene.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Now there was a problem here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It takes 10, 20, sometimes 30 seconds to do this, and that wouldn't be good for the play experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I did is I added some caching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I pre-fill a bunch of these scenes, and then as scenes are taken out of it, I fill it back up again once it gets below a certain threshold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And that way, there's always a scene that's ready to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">With that, the game was ready, and I'm going to share it with you right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Now keep in mind, everything that we see has never been seen before and will never be seen again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is the game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You always start out at this lamppost, and you have to wander around and find your way home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Your stats are in the bottom left corner.

This is like a really windy road that we're going through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's head down. Oh, I'm back where I started. Well, this is the game, and it would continue on and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">on and on until you find your way home, and then you can just play again, and it would be different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">every time. That's great. I just have a few closing thoughts. One thing is that these images are low</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">resolution. They're 512 pixels, and I could make them a higher resolution by adding an AI upscaler to my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">pipeline. It would add more time, so it's a trade-off. Also, I could get more creative with adding something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to the prompt to make a scene. For example, I could let the user select a theme, or maybe even get the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">time of day or the current weather at the location of where the user is set, and then the scenes could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">be generated to match where they are for a very immersive experience. And of course, I can use this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">same process on other projects. That's all. I hope that you found this interesting and enjoyed watching it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KFbT6eph5A&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">as much as I enjoyed putting it all together. Thank you so much.</span></div></div></body></html>
