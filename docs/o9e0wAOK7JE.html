Well, drawing a bit on fuse shotting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9e0wAOK7JE&t=652">00:10:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and self-consistency, I gave it three different angles of the same chart. But even more crucially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9e0wAOK7JE&t=658">00:10:58.260</a></span> | <span class="t">than that perhaps, I asked it recreate the data from the tables. I then said check for any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9e0wAOK7JE&t=664">00:11:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">dissimilarities and resolve them by majority vote. The reason I did this is that I noticed that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9e0wAOK7JE&t=669">00:11:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes it could output a correct table and still get the analysis wrong even though it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9e0wAOK7JE&t=674">00:11:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">simple mathematics. So what this was doing was splitting the task up into two. First it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9e0wAOK7JE&t=679">00:11:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">reducing the chance of minor errors by giving it a higher score than the other two. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9e0wAOK7JE&t=682">00:11:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">it was getting it to do the analysis only after it had already recreated the tables. And look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9e0wAOK7JE&t=690">00:11:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the difference. This time when I asked it about the bottom three countries, it got it right. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9e0wAOK7JE&t=695">00:11:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">then I asked it again, what was it, about the zoo slash aquarium. That was the one it got wrong</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9e0wAOK7JE&t=701">00:11:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">twice before as you saw. This time it correctly picked out China at 51%. If you're wondering by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9e0wAOK7JE&t=707">00:11:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the way how I got different versions of the same image, it was by pressing windows shift and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9e0wAOK7JE&t=712">00:11:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">S and then just highlighting like this. Anyway, I think that's a cool tip. Try it out. Let me know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9e0wAOK7JE&t=718">00:11:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in the comments if it's at all helpful.

Well, Bard kind of flopped saying that the answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9e0wAOK7JE&t=772">00:12:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">was the US but at least got the percentage correct at 51%. Lava did less well saying that the answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9e0wAOK7JE&t=779">00:12:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">was Brazil.
