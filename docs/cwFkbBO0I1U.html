target="_blank">00:18:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">As I say in that book, which came out in 2021, which, by the way, was well after the Slack revolution was underway,</span></div><div

it includes Slack or Teams or whatever low-friction digital communication you're using.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Email was the first, but these other ones have come along.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1150" target="_blank">00:19:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">The real villain in the book is not actually any particular tool, but it is the

channels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Whatever specific type of technology tool you're using, you have to tend these channels constantly because you have many ongoing back-and-forth conversations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you take too long of a break from tending the channels, you're jamming up too many back-and-forth conversations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1199" target="_blank">00:19:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But having to continually check these channels is hugely distracting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It puts your mind to a set of continual context switching, which makes it significantly diminished in its capacities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to burn you out before you get to even like mid-afternoon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1212" target="_blank">00:20:12.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So the hyperactive hive mind is the problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So the right way to understand Slack, and I wrote a New Yorker article about this a few years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">The right way to understand Slack and the weird relationship people have with it, where they sort of love features of it and they hate it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1227" target="_blank">00:20:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">The right way to understand it is that it's the right tool for the wrong way to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1231" target="_blank">00:20:31.380</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the actual trajectory of Slack is people began using email to implement this hyperactive hive mind collaboration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a lot of things about that particular tool that are a little bit clunky when you're trying to do this rapid back-and-forth on-demand collaboration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1247" target="_blank">00:20:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">CCing is clunky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1250" target="_blank">00:20:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Threads aren't automatically threaded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Having to find things is difficult again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1256" target="_blank">00:20:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The sort of quotes and re-quotes and quotes of quotes of quotes that happen when you get these long email back-and-forth conversations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It works, but it's not great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So Slack came along and said, okay, if you want to use the hyperactive hive mind to collaborate, this is a better tool for the hyperactive hive mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1271" target="_blank">00:21:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It is a better tool for that style of collaboration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So the reason why people love it and hate it is that if your work is using the hyperactive hive mind, which it probably is, Slack is better suited for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1283" target="_blank">00:21:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Searchable transcripts, different conversations on different channels, back and forth, as opposed to having the quote, and you can go back and find conversations before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1292" target="_blank">00:21:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just like a better implementation of the hyperactive hive mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But we also hate the hyperactive hive mind, because it forces us to constantly be context-shifting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1300" target="_blank">00:21:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So Slack is better at implementing that hive mind, so we don't have rough ends on our features, but that means we have to be even more hyperactive, and we have to check channels even more often.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1307" target="_blank">00:21:47.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we hate the things we hate about the hive mind more, while simultaneously liking that at least this is a more efficient way of implementing this thing we hate, and it's an all-circular sort of terrible mess.</span></div><div class="c"><span

target="_blank">00:22:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a good question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1366" target="_blank">00:22:46.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It depends on the type of projects we're talking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1369" target="_blank">00:22:49.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So when it comes to deep work, long ongoing projects, if they are of the same type, sequential is usually better, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you were saying I have three script projects I was working on, I would work on one, then work on another, and then work on a third.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1386" target="_blank">00:23:06.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I would definitely not interleave three similar type projects on a very small timescale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1392" target="_blank">00:23:12.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I'm going to work on a

just too much context shifting for you to really make progress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1398" target="_blank">00:23:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to pay a price of a cognitive overhead to get going with each of those, and that overhead is just going to add up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're working on multiple projects on a small timescale, too much of your time is just on the overhead of trying to switch your thinking from one to another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1410" target="_blank">00:23:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, there is a caveat here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.380</a></span> | <span class="t">If it's a very long project, you can break the project into large chunks and do those sequentially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1417" target="_blank">00:23:37.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've seen this with screenwriters before that maybe they'll work on act one of a screenplay, sort of finish it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, okay, I don't quite know where to go to act two yet, and I'm a little stuck.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1427" target="_blank">00:23:47.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I'm going to go work on the act three of this other screenplay I started and finish that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1431" target="_blank">00:23:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Then I'll come back and do act two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can break a project up into, like, big chunks, but you're still going to be working multiple weeks on one before you switch to the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1439" target="_blank">00:23:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have projects of different types, or maybe you have a long-term project and then shorter projects that have to go on as well, then there is some interleaving that has to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1449" target="_blank">00:24:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And I have to do this because I'm typically working on something like a book project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1452" target="_blank">00:24:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I'll be interleaving in things like New Yorker articles or academic articles, which happen on a smaller timescale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And typically I'm always writing books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1461" target="_blank">00:24:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I was like, let me finish my book before I write, like, my next New Yorker essay or my next academic paper, those just wouldn't get done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1468" target="_blank">00:24:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So if it's a different type of project, like a smaller project, yeah, just get to a good stopping place on the big project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1474" target="_blank">00:24:34.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I'll pause it for a week to really push another project through to completion, then return to the big project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1480" target="_blank">00:24:40.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, there is a caveat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1482" target="_blank">00:24:42.220</a></span> | <span class="t">The caveat here is I separate out preparation, which is brainstorming and research, from actual writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1487" target="_blank">00:24:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I might be working on my book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1490" target="_blank">00:24:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Like today, I'll use my actual day-to-day as an example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1494" target="_blank">00:24:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I am working on the final

class="t">I also have a—there's a New Yorker piece I'm working on, and there's an academic paper I'm working on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1511" target="_blank">00:25:11.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Those two smaller things are in the research thinking phase, and that is fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So I wrote all morning on my book, and then I have two calls this afternoon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1520" target="_blank">00:25:20.680</a></span> | <span

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.900</a></span> | <span class="t">That's fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1527" target="_blank">00:25:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">That's research thinking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm happy to add that into the afternoon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1530" target="_blank">00:25:30.580</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not as—I'm not in the full cognitive context of trying to figure out and write.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1535" target="_blank">00:25:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just sort of gathering information or discussing things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1537" target="_blank">00:25:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So I wrote this morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1539" target="_blank">00:25:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm doing background research on those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1540" target="_blank">00:25:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">When it comes time to pull the trigger on one of those two smaller projects—so let's say, like, the New Yorker article gets to a point first where I'm like, okay, I'm ready to write this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Then I will pause the book and just for a week write that article.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1554" target="_blank">00:25:54.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, when it comes to the actual deepest of deep efforts, like writing, the actual putting a pen to paper, I don't interleave at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1561" target="_blank">00:26:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to be working on one thing at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span

sequential, whether full project and then work on the next full project or big chunk of one project for you to do big chunk of the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1584" target="_blank">00:26:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">For smaller stuff interleaving for bigger stuff, you want to pause the big thing to work on the small, but you can allow the research to overlap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1591" target="_blank">00:26:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's kind of a complicated set of scenarios there, Jesse, but hopefully that—I think about this type of thing a lot.</span></div><div

you know him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1681" target="_blank">00:28:01.620</a></span> | <span class="t">He's a Danish

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1704" target="_blank">00:28:24.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And he's arguing that young people, especially like talented people coming out of elite school, should have more moral ambition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1710" target="_blank">00:28:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They should use their lives more to go do like useful things for the world as opposed to, say, like going into finance or law to try to alchemize their elite training in the money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1722" target="_blank">00:28:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, interesting argument.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1725" target="_blank">00:28:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the question is, is that somehow working against my vision of lifestyle-centered career planning?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't think so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1735" target="_blank">00:28:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the issue here—I've been realizing this recently—is the word lifestyle, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1741" target="_blank">00:29:01.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I think about lifestyle in a very clinical definition sense of the word, which is just literally what is the style of your life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1748" target="_blank">00:29:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the day-to-day realities like, like your life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1750" target="_blank">00:29:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, when I say lifestyle-centered career planning, I'm saying, look, fix what you want your life to be like in a more general sense and then work backwards from that to find specific ways to deal with obstacles and opportunities that face you to make your way closer to that lifestyle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1765" target="_blank">00:29:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Because ultimately, you want the lifestyle that is appealing to you as the ultimate goal, not accomplishing any particular goal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1772" target="_blank">00:29:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we might as well get directly to the problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1773" target="_blank">00:29:33.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think a lot of people associate lifestyle with something that's maybe softer or is a little bit more like self-indulgent or lazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1780" target="_blank">00:29:40.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, there's the term, for example, lifestyle entrepreneur, which is typically pitched as, well, you have your own business in part so that you can have like a lot more like flexibility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1790" target="_blank">00:29:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">The work is not too hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1791" target="_blank">00:29:51.700</a></span> | <span class="t">If you work for someone else, you'd have to work harder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1793" target="_blank">00:29:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you have your own business, you can sort of trade working harder for, you know, having more vacations or not having to work so—you know, not having to put in really long hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1803" target="_blank">00:30:03.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's not—I don't necessarily mean lifestyle to be soft.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1806" target="_blank">00:30:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the core things that could be a part of your lifestyle vision is moral ambition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1810" target="_blank">00:30:10.580</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, lifestyle-centric career planning, I think, is probably better suited for Rucker Bregman's vision of moral ambition than other ways that people think about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1822" target="_blank">00:30:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if you have this strong vision of, like, I want to improve the world, this could be a big, vivid component to your vision of your ideal future lifestyle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1831" target="_blank">00:30:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a lifestyle where you're, like, heavily involved in, like, directly being useful to the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1835" target="_blank">00:30:35.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can get a little bit more specific about, like, for you, does that mean, like, I'm directly involved with people who I'm helping?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1842" target="_blank">00:30:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Or maybe you have more of an intellectual conception of moral ambition, that I am producing ideas that are really changing the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1850" target="_blank">00:30:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I did a cool profile like this in my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1855" target="_blank">00:30:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Pardi Sabeti, who was a computational biologist at Harvard and went and spent some time in her lab.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1860" target="_blank">00:31:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And I sort of profiled her as someone who was doing this, who had this sort of moral ambition, and found an interesting way to get there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1866" target="_blank">00:31:06.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And she ended up in a biology lab working on genetic algorithms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And they were using them to study ancient diseases and to try to find ways to get around them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1874"

target="_blank">00:31:15.300</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, she works in computers in the lab, but they also go with the partner institution in sub-Saharan Africa, where they go and spend a lot of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1883" target="_blank">00:31:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was just like a really cool mission-driven life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1885" target="_blank">00:31:25.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, my argument there was she didn't sit down at some point and say, here's my grand goal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1890" target="_blank">00:31:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to be a algorithmic geneticist who works in a, you know, lab in Africa.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1894" target="_blank">00:31:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It was working backwards from the more general moral ambition is like, I want to use my smarts to try to do something good for the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1901" target="_blank">00:31:41.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want it to be intellectual, but also connect directly to people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1906" target="_blank">00:31:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there was a, I documented in the book, all sorts of different serendipity and opportunities that came out of nowhere that she sort of followed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1914" target="_blank">00:31:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And it led her eventually to this place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1917" target="_blank">00:31:57.060</a></span> | <span class="t">She was guided by that lifestyle vision very consistently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1920" target="_blank">00:32:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">The path was jagging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1923" target="_blank">00:32:03.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So, no, lifestyle-saving planning doesn't mean lifestyle entrepreneurship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1927" target="_blank">00:32:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't mean just chill.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1929" target="_blank">00:32:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So, moral ambition could be a part of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1931" target="_blank">00:32:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why I blurred that book, is that people need more ammunition for their visions of the ideal lifestyle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1936" target="_blank">00:32:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And this book will give you one particular ambition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1938" target="_blank">00:32:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It actually complements very well my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1942" target="_blank">00:32:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">There's, there's a world that's really incestuous and overlapping, Jesse, but, like, Rutger Bregman, when you think about his moral ambition, you need to do something good for the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1950" target="_blank">00:32:30.460</a></span> | <span class="t">It kind of has a feel of, like, the effect of altruist, but he's not nearly as clinical as they are and kind of weird.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1959" target="_blank">00:32:39.460</a></span> | <span class="t">But the effect of altruist really likes So Good They Can't Ignore You.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1962" target="_blank">00:32:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was because they felt like, yeah, this is, like, more, you know, you're trying to be more systematic about being useful and not just, like, following your passion or this or that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1972" target="_blank">00:32:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So all these worlds kind of mixed together a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1973" target="_blank">00:32:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I was going to say he wasn't so

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1982" target="_blank">00:33:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't, okay, I don't know this world well, but there was a, there's a group out of Oxford that Will, what's his name?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1989" target="_blank">00:33:09.340</a></span> | <span

boys, like, early on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1994" target="_blank">00:33:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so I knew, I would cross paths with Will because there was this group out of Oxford that I think he was involved with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=1999" target="_blank">00:33:19.860</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's a cool group that was called 80,000 Hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2002" target="_blank">00:33:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">80,000 Hours is, like, the number of hours the typical person will spend working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2007" target="_blank">00:33:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So their whole point, and this is an EA point, is the biggest lever you have to help the world is, like, what you're doing with those 80,000 Hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2015" target="_blank">00:33:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so 80,000 Hours.org was, like, a non-profit based out of Oxford, I believe, that was, like, helping people figure out what to do with their lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2022" target="_blank">00:33:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">In a way, not the, and they were very much, like, don't just say follow your passion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2026" target="_blank">00:33:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Be, like, no, no, how can I be effective?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2029" target="_blank">00:33:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what do I want to do with this that's really good?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2031" target="_blank">00:33:51.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is kind of an interesting

able to have more time after where I'm like, maybe it's—I'm not super stressed about work when it's done, and I don't feel like I'm constantly playing catch-up on home-related or family-related issues afterwards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2218" target="_blank">00:36:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I want to be at an

whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2230" target="_blank">00:37:10.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Then when you work backwards

make double my husband, and if I go back to half hours, I'm going to feel like I'm being sidelined, but I have, like, an intellectual or professional ambition, and I feel like I'm actually better than him at stuff in my, like, job, and this is, like, I'm feeling resentful about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2256"

change it to a different job that uses my career capital but is less than one of these we're paying for your time, you always have to be accessible type jobs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2271" target="_blank">00:37:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's going to be less money, but something where, like, I could use

<span class="t">He's making about a third of the income, and you cut that in half, so that's going to be about a sixth, versus if you went halftime, you're reducing it by a third, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2295" target="_blank">00:38:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And then maybe he's able to take on really clearly delineated, like, these family responsibilities that means you don't feel so stressed about the stuff going on after work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2303" target="_blank">00:38:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, there's different types of options here that's worth thinking about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2307" target="_blank">00:38:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But what I'm going at is, like, get the lifestyle, like, what do you want your day to be like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2312"

class="t">Okay, so let's say you've done that, and the best option for it is, like, a new job, maybe something that's 50% time or just, like, less demanding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2333" target="_blank">00:38:53.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Here, what I have found is that when it comes to stuff that's well past

target="_blank">00:39:02.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It has to be—it often feels like for people that it's manifested, and what happens is when you begin thinking, looking, and talking about them, kind of looking for something different that's going to be less demanding, and you talk to friends about this, and you talk to colleagues about this, and you have some conversations, suddenly these super bespoke, one-of-a-kind type of opportunities just have a way of sort of sifting out or materialized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

they need to start an outpost over here where you happen to live, and they need someone who can run it for the next couple of years, and it's, like, a great match for your skills, but it's really autonomous and probably much less time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2377" target="_blank">00:39:37.580</a></span> | <span

currently completing my doctorate in Baltimore and, meanwhile, conduct a number of different orchestras and other ensembles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2871" target="_blank">00:47:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted to ask you about the concept of interleaving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2874" target="_blank">00:47:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's something you've talked about before, and it's come out in Adam Grant's recent book, Hidden Potential.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2880" target="_blank">00:48:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Musicians know this concept well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2883" target="_blank">00:48:03.260</a></span> | <span class="t">You might work on skill A for a while and then go to skill B, and then go back to skill A, then skill C, then skill B, something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2893" target="_blank">00:48:13.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But when I think about this idea, it reminds me a lot of the idea of task switching, which I know very well is something we want to avoid when we're trying to engage in deep work, especially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2907" target="_blank">00:48:27.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I wonder what you think about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2909" target="_blank">00:48:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it that task switching in this particular case is between various deep work-related tasks, and therefore it is cognitively demanding, but it's the appropriate place to spend that cognitive buck?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2925" target="_blank">00:48:45.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Or is there some other way to contextualize and reconcile these two seemingly opposing ideas?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2933" target="_blank">00:48:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2936" target="_blank">00:48:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, we talked about this a little bit with the screenwriter question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2941" target="_blank">00:49:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to get more precise in answering this more precise version of the question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2947" target="_blank">00:49:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So when it comes to task switching, the main thing that we worry about is the cognitive overhead of that network switch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2956" target="_blank">00:49:16.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So when I switch my attention from the thing I'm writing to an email inbox, the target of my attention is switching from that thing I'm writing over to whatever demands are made of me in that email inbox.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2970" target="_blank">00:49:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And this institutes what a psychologist would call a network switch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2973" target="_blank">00:49:33.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Our brain is trying to shift its focus from this cognitive context over to this other cognitive context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2978" target="_blank">00:49:38.340</a></span> | <span class="t">That's expensive and takes time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2980" target="_blank">00:49:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">That can take 10, 15, up to 20 minutes to fully switch your context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2984" target="_blank">00:49:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So what happens when we glance at an email inbox for five minutes is we start a network switch, we abandon it and go back to the original thing, and now we have a mix of both of those networks together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2992" target="_blank">00:49:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And before we can completely regain our cognitive context on the original thing, we look at our inbox again and institute another network switch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=2998" target="_blank">00:49:58.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's that state of sort of partial, continuous partial attention, to use the Linda Stone term or the diminished cognitive capacity I talk about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3006" target="_blank">00:50:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So the cost of task switching, our problem with task switching is this like 10 to 20 minute cost of trying to change your attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3012" target="_blank">00:50:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's slow to change attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3013" target="_blank">00:50:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So when it comes to like a deeper task that's done over a longer period of time, that type of task switching cost doesn't matter much as long as you're spreading out these switches over a long enough time that the ratio of switching cost to execution gets really small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3030" target="_blank">00:50:30.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So like if I'm working on one skill all day Monday and another skill all day Tuesday, and then back to the first skill on Wednesday and the other skill on Tuesday, the task switching cost here is negligible, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3040" target="_blank">00:50:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it's, yeah, it takes me 20 minutes to really get in the mindset of that skill, but then I'm spending eight hours that day working on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3046" target="_blank">00:50:46.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I work the next day, I have to switch to the other skill, that's 20 minutes, but I'm spending all day working on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3051" target="_blank">00:50:51.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So once you get to bigger time scales than like once every five minutes, I'm checking something, that type of overhead matters less.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3057" target="_blank">00:50:57.220</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a second type of overhead that I mentioned in the screenwriter question that also sort of matters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3063" target="_blank">00:51:03.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is like a bigger orientation overhead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3067" target="_blank">00:51:07.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Like when I'm working on a book, yes, there's a cognitive cost to actually getting my attention all the way on the chapter I'm writing now, but there's a bigger orientation I have over a bigger time period just towards working on that book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3079" target="_blank">00:51:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm thinking about the book, and when I'm not writing, it's in my head, and I'll bounce around thoughts, and it's kind of there in the background churning, and then I come back to it, I work some more on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3089" target="_blank">00:51:29.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Maintaining a general orientation towards a very large or important project is helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3095" target="_blank">00:51:35.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a cost to switching that that you'll feel on a bigger time scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3101" target="_blank">00:51:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is where if I was working on two books and switching between them on Monday and Tuesday and then back to one on Wednesday, back to the other on Thursday, that cognitive switching cost of just switching my current focus, who cares?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3113" target="_blank">00:51:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It takes 20 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3114" target="_blank">00:51:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm spending the whole day working on one book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3115" target="_blank">00:51:55.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But the orientation switching cost, that would be a problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3118" target="_blank">00:51:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I start to get, well, I'm kind of, my mind is oriented towards solving this book, but then I'm trying to reorient and try to start solving that book, and that could be a problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3126" target="_blank">00:52:06.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I first learned about this actually with academic paper writing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3129" target="_blank">00:52:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I used to work on multiple academic papers at the same time, meaning not the same day, but, like, some days I'll work on this one, then later in the week I'd work on another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3137" target="_blank">00:52:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And my advisor, who's, you know, famous in the field, was like, no, no, no, just do one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3142" target="_blank">00:52:22.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Stay oriented on that one until you've solved it and done the best possible work, then write the next.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3146" target="_blank">00:52:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, ah, it's faster to work on multiple ones at the same time, but she was right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3149" target="_blank">00:52:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">One at a time was going to produce the better work because you can keep your general cognitive orientation towards that one project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3156" target="_blank">00:52:36.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So what's the scale at which you'd be switching those?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3158" target="_blank">00:52:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That's at, like, multiple weeks or months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3161" target="_blank">00:52:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why I was saying to the screenwriter, if you want to switch your context between different screenplays, you want a chunk that's like, I wrote the whole first act of the screenplay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3171" target="_blank">00:52:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It took a month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3172" target="_blank">00:52:52.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if you want to switch your orientation to another screenplay and spend six weeks working on it second act, that's okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3178" target="_blank">00:52:58.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It'll take a few days to sort of get your cognitive orientation fully switched over, but then you'll get into the groove of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3184" target="_blank">00:53:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have two scales of context switching, the sort of in-the-moment immediate focus scale, which is what kills us when we check our email or Slack so much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3191" target="_blank">00:53:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the bigger picture, like general cognitive orientation, that can take days to really switch over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3197" target="_blank">00:53:17.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in the end, what this tells us is for, like, really big, long cognitive endeavors, you want to give things multiple weeks before you switch to another really big thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3208" target="_blank">00:53:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And if possible, like, push something through to a really clear finishing point before you switch over to something else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3213" target="_blank">00:53:33.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So we got two levels of test switching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3217" target="_blank">00:53:37.300</a></span> |

The scaling laws held for a little while. GPT-2 was much better than the original GPT. GPT-3 was a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3610" target="_blank">01:00:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">giant leap beyond GPT-2.

So there is this idea that if we keep scaling, these language models will have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwFkbBO0I1U&t=3629" target="_blank">01:00:29.320</a></span> | <span class="t">so many capabilities.
