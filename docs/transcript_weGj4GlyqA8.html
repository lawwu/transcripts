I'm thinking mostly about IRAs, 401Ks, 403Bs, but my favorite is probably the Roth IRA and the HSA. And that's because they offer a ton of flexibility, really low fees, because you can house them usually at a brokerage account of your choosing, and some of the best investment options.</p><p>And on the HSA side, you've got the triple tax deduction of being able to put money in tax-free, being able to take it out tax-free, and being able to have it grow tax-free. So it's an amazing account. And on the Roth IRA side, I know many people don't think that they might be eligible because of their income or their workplace retirement plans.</p><p>I'd encourage you to go look into a backdoor Roth IRA contribution. It's kind of a workaround that the IRS has finally signed off on, if you will, and it's something I do every year. And so take a look at that as a way to be able to contribute to a Roth IRA, even if you're not directly eligible.</p></div></div></body></html>
