And then there's given that risk, what's the mix of investments that make sense to achieve your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">goals? Back up for one second and say, "The reason anyone should even do this is that their money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">wants to keep up with inflation." Is that the premise of why even invest your money in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">first place? Well, I think most people want to invest their money to reach to spend it in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">future. So I think beating inflation is a great goal. But I think people want to go beyond that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and try to get as much out as they can. And the question is, well, how do you do that? What</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">investments do you need to do that? Yeah. And the reason why you wouldn't just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">invest it in the riskiest thing in the world, as you said, is risk is very important. How much you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">can and are comfortable taking. And there are lots of questionnaires online to answer those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I'd say someone could go get a risk score. One of the things that I think we noticed when we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">were talking with clients was people are a little bit maybe more optimistic about their own tolerance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">for risk than might actually happen. And depending on whether you've ever invested in the stock</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">market or some investment that went down, the typical question is like, "If the market goes down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">30%, what do you do? Do you buy more? Do you sell? Do you freak out?" Do you feel like those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">questions actually can gauge someone's risk? Yeah. I'm skeptical of the online risk scores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of them ask questions about what would you do if it was down 30%. Some of them ask questions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">which are even worse, which are how much would you be willing to pay for a coin flip bet or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">something like that.

So I think you can try to take those questionnaires and see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">what they say as a general guide. But I think one of the exercises that we did with clients at Grove,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">which I think is the most helpful, is to really try to imagine yourself in your current situation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">with your brokerage account, with your retirement portfolio.

And is there a percentage loss or dollar loss that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">say, "This would be extremely uncomfortable for me"? So I think playing out a scenario could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">actually be a really helpful way to understand what your risk tolerance is at this point for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think not everyone that's an investor today was an investor four years ago.

And then I had people that wrote it all the way to the bottom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and wrote it all the way back up to the top and beyond. And so we have one data point that if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">were an investor four years ago, you could maybe say, "How did I feel?" Yeah, I think that's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">helpful. But as you point out, the recent drops have been pretty shallow and pretty quick recovery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It's helpful to look a little further back in history and say, "Okay, well, can you put yourself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in the mind of if the drop had been 50% and was there for a little bit and the economic news was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">consistently bad for a long time, like it was in the 2008, 2009, where you had a lot of investors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">say, "What am I doing? I'm going to take a step back and sell." And I think from the trough over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the next year, the market was up 65% or something.

And so the reason why this is important is because you want a portfolio that you're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">going to sell out of when it's down, because if you do, you will often miss out on the ride back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to the top. Yeah. I think that's one of the major mistakes that retail investors make.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's a very easy mistake to make because all these signals are negative. And the market is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">very different type of system than the ones we're used to dealing with. If you want a good restaurant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to go to, then you need to ask your friends, "Hey, what was your experience at this restaurant?"

Yeah. I mean, if you invested all of your money at the bottom of the crash in '08 or the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">bottom of the crash, that would be great. But I think we could probably talk about it a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">later. Waiting for that bottom might not actually be as good a strategy as just being invested now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I did an interview with a guy named Nick Majulie, who wrote a book that I believe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is just "Just Keep Buying." And his argument was like, "Don't stop and wait. Just keep buying."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We won't go down that path yet. So okay. So when we think about constructing a portfolio,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I think before you start, you need to think about your risk and how much you can tolerate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">because that's going to come into play. And how much you can emotionally tolerate and actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">financially. If all the money you have is in the market, and you need it for lots of things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in your life, you might be comfortable with a 50% drop, but you might not be able to financially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">afford it. So that's this other component that I think is often missed is can your financial</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">situation tolerate? Yeah. And I think a lot of that is a function of what money do you need in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the near future. If you're planning on buying a house in two months, then you probably shouldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">have that all in the equity market, because the market could easily drop and you could lose money</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and not be able to buy the house. So that affects your capacity to take risks, we would call it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Okay. So now I've kind of understood, hopefully a little bit about my own personality,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">my own capacity and tolerance. But we actually have to build a portfolio. And so there are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">a seemingly unlimited number of things you can invest in. And I'm going to assume that most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">people here are looking to grow their money over time and beat inflation and earn more than just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">leaving their money in a bank account. How do you even begin to think about how to construct the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">portfolio? Yeah. So I think one principle would be diversification. And there's a lot of reasons</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">for diversification. One is that you don't want necessarily a portfolio that's going to do well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">only in one set of conditions, because it's very hard to know what the future holds, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So we think about asset class diversification as being important so that the portfolio can do well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">both in periods of high economic growth, and it doesn't totally fall apart in low economic growth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that it can withstand periods of high inflation and low inflation. So different asset classes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">can do well in different circumstances, right? So like stocks, in periods of high economic growth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">stocks can do well. Low economic growth, you have government bonds can perform better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Periods of high inflation, you have TIPS, which are inflation-indexed government bonds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Those can do well, and also commodities, and in some circumstances, real estate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So you're thinking about having a mix of asset classes that can benefit you a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And is it just asset classes, or is it geographies, size of the companies in those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">asset classes? How far can you go down the diversification path, and can you go too far?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So going further down the diversification, there are kind of two other axes I would think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">about the diversification. One is across geographies. If you don't want to be exposed to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">idiosyncratic things that happen in a country, you can diversify and say, "I'm going to invest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">some in the US, I'm going to invest some in Europe, and invest some in Asia."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can also think about diversifying within a geography across companies. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you may not want to say, "Oh, I'm going to put all my money into one company in the US or in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">each country." There's benefits in owning a lot of different companies so that you're not exposed to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">What if there's fraud or something that happened, or the company has a product that becomes less</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">competitive? So yeah, I think there are benefits on those two axes too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So I think it's pretty agreed by most people that you want to diversify your portfolio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to diversify it, like you said, across asset classes, across geographies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you actually figure out what it is? So I'm thinking there's the old school portfolio,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">which is just like 60/40 stocks and bonds.

Right? And let's say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=2789" target="_blank">00:46:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">"Okay, that means 50% of my money is in equities, and I'm going to put 50% under my mattress."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=2795" target="_blank">00:46:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Then the question is, "Well, what else can you do with it?"

Because if equities move down and bonds move up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=2822" target="_blank">00:47:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">then your total portfolio drop is going to be lower than if you just had 50% in equities and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=2828" target="_blank">00:47:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the rest under your mattress.

I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=3930" target="_blank">01:05:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you will probably lose if you compare Google to investing in the total stock market since Google's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=3935" target="_blank">01:05:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">IPO.

Well, if you had invested</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=3953" target="_blank">01:05:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in the stock market for five years, I'm not saying it would have gone up 100%, but you want to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=3958" target="_blank">01:05:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">sure you're at least comparing things apples to apples. And so a lot of times I see people say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=3962" target="_blank">01:06:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">"Gosh, I don't want to sell this thing.

So we moved into this portfolio. A question that I've both gotten and thought about a lot is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4007" target="_blank">01:06:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">well, it's easy to think about your investment portfolio and say, "Great.

Yeah. It's certainly true that there's that opportunity for additional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4057" target="_blank">01:07:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">optimization. It's like, because assets are taxed differently and accounts have different tax</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4065" target="_blank">01:07:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">treatment of the assets inside, then there's opportunity to optimize that. And I think there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4074" target="_blank">01:07:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is additional value to doing that. The question is, how much value is there? And that depends on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4080" target="_blank">01:08:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">your tax situation and how much money you have invested, and also how complicated is it? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4089" target="_blank">01:08:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">what's your appetite to do it yourself?

If you say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4107" target="_blank">01:08:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you have, call it you're considering moving 20% of your portfolio to a tax-advantaged account,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4115" target="_blank">01:08:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and that 20% that wasn't there, you're going to move somewhere else. And you say, okay, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4120" target="_blank">01:08:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and that 20%, I expect to earn, let's say, 5%, have a 5% return. So then you're talking about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4131" target="_blank">01:08:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, how is that 1% of your portfolio return taxed?

It's like, that's 22% difference in the tax rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4167" target="_blank">01:09:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're saying, okay, well, I'm going to have a 22% difference in the tax rate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4171" target="_blank">01:09:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">on that 1% of return. That ends up being 0.2% of your portfolio in additional return due to this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4179" target="_blank">01:09:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">tax optimization. And I would consider a pretty good scenario where you're doing 20% in the best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4184" target="_blank">01:09:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">tax treatment or the worst tax treatment. So 0.2%, that's something, that's not nothing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4191" target="_blank">01:09:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And depending on the size of your portfolio, that could be significant,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4196" target="_blank">01:09:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and that could compound over time. But I think the implementation of it is usually not so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4203" target="_blank">01:10:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">straightforward.

And there's kind of two components</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4239" target="_blank">01:10:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to it.

If your equities are going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4246" target="_blank">01:10:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">grow at a rate that you expect to be higher than your bonds, then having your equities be in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4253" target="_blank">01:10:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Roth IRA that will not have any taxes in the future versus your bonds that will have a lower return,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4259" target="_blank">01:10:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that could make sense.

There's a great story</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4269" target="_blank">01:11:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">about a handful of people who have taken their Roth IRAs and invested in startups that have been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4276" target="_blank">01:11:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the highest returning things. And because they had no future taxes in their Roth IRA,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4280" target="_blank">01:11:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">they got all those things tax free.

So in our circumstance, we had two Roth IRAs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4309" target="_blank">01:11:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">two 401(k)s, and a taxable account. So we had five accounts. And if we decided that our perfect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4315" target="_blank">01:11:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">portfolio was even 70/30, which would be the easiest one, or a two fund portfolio, obviously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4320" target="_blank">01:12:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">100% zero would be the easiest one. Then we're not doing any optimization. You're like, "Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4326" target="_blank">01:12:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">well, I'm going to put these in here." One of the accounts is ultimately going to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4330" target="_blank">01:12:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">two things in it. And as one account grows, it's going to grow faster or differently because they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=4336" target="_blank">01:12:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">don't have the same thing in it.

For me, I think I have a four-fund portfolio. And I was like, "I just want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdJ2sxcBBY&t=6067" target="_blank">01:41:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">them at 40/30/20/10."
