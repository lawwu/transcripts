So similarly, as I was going through anything, I just got in my mind, okay, could this go out? Okay, I'm putting a list. Once I saw the magnitude of that list, you know, if you think about the cost of hiring virtual assistants, you said it could be anywhere from one to $4,000 a month for a full-time person.</p><p>And there are other options if you want fractional and all that stuff. Imagine what you could do with that, whether it's spending it just with your family or on really big strategic things with your business. Maybe you don't have time to buy a small business because you have so much stuff going on in your personal life.</p><p>What if you could outsource a lot of that personal life stuff so that you could go and buy a small business?</p></div></div></body></html>
