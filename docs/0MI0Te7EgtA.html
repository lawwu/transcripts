actually, at least for me, it was a many decade journey to this point, and it's because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I've done so many other things and seen how much easier my life is with deep learning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that I've become such an evangelist with this technology.</span></div><div

Company, which is a management consulting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.920</a></span> | <span

started there when I was 18.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was a challenge, because in strategy consulting, people are generally really leveraging</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">their expertise and experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, I didn't have either of those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So I really had to rely on data analysis right from the start.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So what happened was, from the very start of my career, I was really relying very heavily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">on applied data analysis to answer real world questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in a consulting context, you don't have that much time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're talking to people who really have a lot of domain expertise, and you have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">be able to communicate in a way that actually matters to them.</span></div><div

analysis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">One of my favorite things to use was this was just before kind of pivot tables appeared.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And when they appeared, that was like something I used a lot, used various kind of database</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.360</a></span> | <span class="t">tools and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But I did actually use machine learning quite a bit and had a lot of success with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of the machine learning that I was doing was based on kind of logistic or linear regression</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Rather than show you something I did back then, because I can't because it was all proprietary,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:03:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And the inputs to their five-year survival model were histopathology slices, stain slides.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">They used a regularized logistic regression.</span></div><div class="c"><span

thousands I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So it took many people many years to create these features and come up with them and implement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">them and test

that makes them natural splines is that the endpoints</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.880</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">input domain really nicely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see as you add more and more knots with just two knots, you start out with a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">line and as you add more knots, you start to get more and more opportunities for curves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the cool things about natural splines, they're also called restricted cubic splines,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is that actually you don't have to think at all about where to put the knot points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It turns out that there's basically a set of quantiles where you can put the knot points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty reliably depending on how many knot points you want, which is independent of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">data, and nearly always works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So this was a nice trick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then another nice trick is if you do use regularized regression, particularly L1 regularized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">regression I really like, you don't even have to be that careful about the number of parameters</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=460"

target="_blank">00:07:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can often include quite a lot of transformations, including interactions of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is an approach that I used a lot and had a lot of success with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But then in, I think it was '99

decision tree, this is data from the Kaggle competition which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=520"

of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">coupler system.</span></div><div

system, it did a binary split on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">year made, and those which then were made in early years, then we can see immediately</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=546"

along thanks to Bryman, who, a very interesting guy, he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.840</a></span> |

about this, for me, is that we never actually deployed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.680</a></span> |

we did was we used random forests to understand the data, and then we used that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding of the data to then go back and basically build more traditional regression</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

the cool things that you get out of a random forest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a feature importance plot, and it shows you-- so this is, again, the same data set,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the option price data set from Kaggle-- it shows you which are the most important

is you don't have to do any transformations or think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">interactions or non-linearities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Because they're using decision trees behind the scenes, it all just works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I kind of developed this pretty simple approach where I would first create a random</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">forest, and I would then find which features and so forth are useful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd then use partial dependence plots to kind of look at the shapes of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I would go back and kind of, for the continuous variables that matter, create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the cubic splines, and create the interactions, and then do a regression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this basic kind of trick was incredibly powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And I used it, a variance of it, in the early days of Kaggle amongst other things, and got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=775"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And funnily enough, actually, back in 2011, I described my approaches to Kaggle competitions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">in Melbourne at the

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">which was deep learning being better than humans at very human tasks, like looking at

about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it?</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:17:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I had been interested in neural networks since the very start of my career.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

implementing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">a neural network in the

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.900</a></span> | <span class="t">point would probably take over just about everything else in terms of my area of

that's like 30 years ago now, nearly, but there was some issues back then for one thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=1119" target="_blank">00:18:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we had to buy custom hardware that cost millions of dollars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

the key problem was that back then everybody was relying on this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=1145"

many times in deep learning history where theory has been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=1169"

like for those 20 years, at some point, neural networks are going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">reappear in my life because of this infinitely flexible function, the fact that they can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

again, there was a problem with theory here, which is I spent many, many years focused</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=1230"

of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">what is proofably able to find the

what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">actually works in

model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that's better than anything in

2014, 2015, we started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=1339" target="_blank">00:22:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to see some

more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=1360" target="_blank">00:22:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">people could try things out and

people working on making neural nets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=1410" target="_blank">00:23:30.360</a></span> | <span

what was happening in 2015 was not a sudden, here's this new thing where I got organophlock</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=1419"

at OpenAI's DALI, this is a model that's been trained on pairs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=1467"

what computers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">can do, and look what

thing, which is like the thing that figures out whether</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.080</a></span>

every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=1658" target="_blank">00:27:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">other model I build with fairly

than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=1703" target="_blank">00:28:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">any other known

that was really exciting for me to see how we could help kind of put a technology</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=1944"

change in human capability,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2033" target="_blank">00:33:53.640</a></span> | <span class="t">which

at least make it so that what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2059" target="_blank">00:34:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">people

the course into a book as well, along with my friend, Sylvain Goucher,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2378"

that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2391" target="_blank">00:39:51.240</a></span> | <span class="t">into a course is we wanted to

target="_blank">00:40:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">saying, "I don't think it's worth me getting involved in deep learning because it takes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

an issue when Google released their TPUs and put out a big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2418" target="_blank">00:40:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">PR exercise saying, "Okay, TPUs are so great that nobody else can pretty much do anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2429" target="_blank">00:40:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we decided to enter this international competition called Dawn Bench that Google</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2434" target="_blank">00:40:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and Intel had entered to see if

class="t">And so that was called 2018, and we won on many of the axes of the competition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2457" target="_blank">00:40:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The cheapest, the fastest TPU, fastest single machine, and then we followed this up with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2462" target="_blank">00:41:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">additional results that were actually 40% faster than Google's best TPU

because here's a picture of us and our students working on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2474"

target="_blank">00:41:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">It was a really cool time because we really wanted to push back against this narrative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2485" target="_blank">00:41:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we got a lot of media attention, which was great.</span></div><div

more important than using vast amounts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2500" target="_blank">00:41:40.440</a></span> | <span

a critical component of fast AI's work, and we did similar research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2537"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2546" target="_blank">00:42:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So then the question is, OK, well, now that we've actually pushed the boundaries beyond</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2552" target="_blank">00:42:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">what's already known, to say,

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2566" target="_blank">00:42:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why we decided to build a software library called FastAI.</span></div><div

it immediately got a lot of attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2577" target="_blank">00:42:57.960</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:43:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And we were able to show that compared to Keras, for example, it was much more accurate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2589" target="_blank">00:43:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">much faster, far less lines of code, and we really tried to make it as accessible as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2600" target="_blank">00:43:20.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is some of the

that not only do you get the normal kind of API documentation, but it's actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2611"

all directly there as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2621" target="_blank">00:43:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the really nice things is that every single page of the documentation has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2626" target="_blank">00:43:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">a link to actually open that page of documentation as an interactive notebook, because the entire</span></div><div class="c"><span

can experiment with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2638" target="_blank">00:43:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can

really took the kind of approaches that we found worked well in our course, having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2647" target="_blank">00:44:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">students do lots of experiments and lots of coding, and making that a kind of part of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2653" target="_blank">00:44:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">our documentation as well, is to let people really play with everything themselves, experiment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2659" target="_blank">00:44:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and see how it all works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2664" target="_blank">00:44:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So incorporating all of this research into the software was super successful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2669" target="_blank">00:44:29.400</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:44:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I've started pulling across some of my TensorFlow models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

better results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2690" target="_blank">00:44:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So this person said the same thing, yep, we used to try to use TensorFlow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2695" target="_blank">00:44:55.600</a></span> |

software</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2709" target="_blank">00:45:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">library that let people get

trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MI0Te7EgtA&t=2735" target="_blank">00:45:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to do with fast.ai, you can use
