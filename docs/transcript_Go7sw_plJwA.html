I'm trying to understand why that is. Perhaps you can help give me clues. So it's not just the kinds of lectures that you give, but it's also just other folks, like with Numberphile, there's a channel, where they just chat about things that are extremely complicated, actually. People nevertheless connect with them. What do you think that is? - It's wonderful, isn't it? I mean, I wasn't really aware of it. We're conditioned to think math is hard, math is abstract, math is just for a few people, but it isn't that way. A lot of people quite like math, and I get messages from people saying, "You know, now I'm retired, I'm gonna learn some more math." I get a lot of those, it's really encouraging. And I think what people like is that there's some order, a lot of order, and things are not obvious, but they're true. So it's really cheering to think that so many people really wanna learn more about math, yeah. - And in terms of truth, again, sorry to slide into philosophy at times, but math does reveal pretty strongly what things are true. I mean, that's the whole point of proving things. - It is, yeah. - And yet, sort of our real world is messy and complicated. What do you think about the nature of truth that math reveals? - Oh, wow. - Because it is a source of comfort, like you've mentioned. - Yeah, that's right. Well, I have to say, I'm not much of a philosopher. I just like numbers, you know, as a kid. This was before you had to go in when you had a filly in your teeth, you had to kind of just take it. So what I did was think about math, you know, like take powers of two, two, four, eight, 16, up until the time the tooth stopped hurting and the dentist said you were through. Or counting, yeah. So it-- - So that was a source of just, source of peace almost. - Yeah. - What is it about math do you think that brings that? - Yeah. - What is that? - Well, you know where you are. Yeah, it's symmetry, it's certainty. The fact that, you know, if you multiply two by itself 10 times, you get 1,024, period. Everybody's gonna get that. - Do you see math as a powerful tool or as an art form? - So it's both. That's really one of the neat things. You can be an artist and like math. You can be a engineer and use math. - Which are you? Which-- - Which am I? - What did you connect with most? - Yeah, I'm somewhere between. I'm certainly not a artist type, philosopher type person. Might sound that way this morning, but I'm not. (laughing) Yeah, I really enjoy teaching engineers because they go for an answer. And yeah, so probably within the MIT math department, most people enjoy teaching students who get the abstract idea. I'm okay with, I'm good with engineers who are looking for a way to find answers, yeah.
