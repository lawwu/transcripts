I think I had $800 a month to spend. I'm glad that they transitioned to paying players. It just, if you're getting paid millions of dollars at 17, let guys just go from high school to the league at that point. It kind of makes the college concept of you're all in the grind together, it kind of changes that.</p><p>I would get an $1,800 stipend check every single month. Now I think about the guy who's getting the automatic deal that doesn't, his second string on the football team, he makes $50,000 a year. That's different from everybody else. The guys who are making the $6 million in basketball, they're probably going to go to the league.</p><p>But the guy who has half a million in his bank and is never going to go play football again and has to go work a sales job, that's a hell of a savings,</p></div></div></body></html>
