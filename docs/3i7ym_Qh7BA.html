Today, I have the pleasure of speaking with Dominic Cummings, who was the chief advisor to Boris Johnson when he was prime minister.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And before that, he masterminded the Brexit campaign. Let's start with talking with your time in number 10, which is your time as chief advisor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the thing about the government and being in that famous ministry? What is it that most people don't understand?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you go through that door, you're basically going into a sort of a kind of rabbit warren of old townhouses that have been kind of knocked together behind the scenes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's nothing like any kind of modern office building. It's a very, very odd physical environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think probably you'd be struck by, first of all, just the constant string of chaos. I think people don't really appreciate what it's like being in a building like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Every day you've got, so for example, in one day on COVID, the day starts off with, "Are we going to have a lockdown?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It then proceeds to the prime minister's girlfriend going crazy about the media. It then involves Trump calling up saying, "We've got to go and bomb all these people in Iraq."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It then goes to the deep state coming in saying, "We don't think we should because it's probably going to bomb the wrong people."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then other parts of the system come in and say, "No, we should bomb them because we've got to stay friends with America."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then there's some other disaster on the news with something flooding. And it's just constant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, some days are more crazy than others. But I think if you haven't been in that environment, it's extremely hard to appreciate that you have these handful of people trying to come up with the right answers to extremely hard problems with all the weight of the news flooding in on you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That makes it just intrinsically difficult. Then on top of that, you have these just incredibly old centralized bureaucracies actually trying to cope with all of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In number 10, when we arrived, for example, there wasn't even a file sharing system. So a three-man startup could at least write a press release on a Google Doc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, the British prime minister did not have access to such a system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Was it because of security concerns? What was the reason?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because of a combination of bureaucracy, security concerns, arguments between... So it's actually an interesting thing, the Google Docs thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we arrive in summer 2019. There is no system for file sharing. We say, "This is completely insane. We are going to create a system for file sharing."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Months of wrangling ensue. Two different parts of the deep state basically argue about whether Teams or Google Docs is more susceptible to China and Russia intercepting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No resolution. This actually ends up affecting COVID. We force a resolution. We get GCHQ to build a system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Still now, four years after we started this discussion, the cabinet office of number 10 are still fighting about Google Docs versus Teams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And have now recently resolved to hire some consultants for millions of pounds to spend a year doing a study on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So one very small little thing in a way, but probably certainly anyone who's been at the kind of high functioning company would just be completely stunned by a lot of how the core of a G7 state actually works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Hopefully the consultants are allowed to use Google Docs to decide whether you're allowed to use Google Docs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Quite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You go into government. After what you've written on your blog, I had these priorities, these main things I want to accomplish. Day to day, you have all these things that are coming up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Do these things feel like distractions from the thing you went to government to do? Do they all feel important? I mean, you have this big picture idea and all these things are coming up. I mean, what does that feel like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A fundamental problem with how the British state works is this question of prioritization and the prime minister's time. So you have all of these normal parts of the system that essentially can't really do anything quickly at all, even in a crisis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the prime minister's time and the prime minister's prioritization is the most important asset, but also it's something which is constantly pulled hither and thither by all of this craziness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the things that obviously we wanted to do was fundamentally reorient number 10 away from what it's been since Thatcher, which is a kind of press entertainment service where the whole building is just built to respond to what the media says.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And instead say, what do we actually think is important? And what is the management system you're going to build that actually can maintain focus on those things whilst the inevitable chaos goes on, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you almost see, so most obviously, for example, some terrorist incident happens in central London. Prime minister can't ignore that. It's going to involve the prime minister's time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Politics, the news, the government means that there are things like that happening all day, every day, right? So if you have the normal state of affairs, then the prime minister is just pulled from one crisis like that after another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, some of them are justifiable. You've got to deal with a terrorist crisis. But in fact, what's happened over the last 20 years is that that's just been the model for how prime ministers spend practically all of their time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there isn't a kind of background system with a set of people who are just plodding on going, right, the actually important things are science and technology agenda, productivity, reform of the Ministry of Defence, procurement reform, deep state this, et cetera, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a fundamental structural issue. We try to deal with that in various ways. But it led, in January 2020, it was clear that this essential question was already a kind of fundamental disagreement between me and Boris.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the first week of January, Trump had just whacked the Iranian guy, his name I've forgotten now, the head of the revolutionary, whatever it was, with a drone strike in Iraq. So we're talking in that week about the future, so three weeks after the election.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he says, "Well, these various journalists are complaining that you don't return their calls. Now's the time for us to make friends with all of these people after the chaos of 2019." And I said, "No, I don't think that's right at all. We've gone through hell. We've won an 80 seat majority.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now we have to change how this building works and we have to focus on the actual big problems facing the country. And we've got to get number 10 and your time, the PM's time, away from how it's been managed for the last 20 years, which is media entertainment service."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And his response was, "No, no, no, no, no. That's crazy. Everyone will go crazy with us if we do that. We've got to make friends with the media. We drove them all mad last year. Now it's time for us to have great reconciliation." And I said, "Well, we could do that. But if we do that, we'll just be the same as every other government for the last 20 years, which is chasing the bullshit in the media all day. And four years will pass and we won't actually have done anything."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And by then it'll be 14 years of conservative government. We've just won an election partly by running against the previous decade of the conservative party. We can't pull that off again. We're actually going to have to do a whole bunch of things. And also that's why the people are here. We actually want to solve these problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Those issues get to the heart of a lot of it. You have a manageable question about how you actually manage priorities in such an insane environment. You have a personnel problem about a lack of talent. But you also have this fundamental question of, do the key politicians want to spend their time on the important problems or do they want to spend their time running around all day dealing with the media? And the answer is almost all of them want to do the second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot I want to ask about there. It's interesting because the way you're describing it, it sounds like it's a company with the prime minister as a CEO who's dealing with all these operational things that come up, but there is no CEO who has a long-term plan. I'm curious about the media stuff. I want to understand why it's the case that they're so obsessed with the media. Does the media actually matter that much to how people perceive the politicians?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How is the media interacting with the things that are happening in the building so that people are constantly thinking about the media? Why is the media so ever-present in people's minds here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just going back to your first point about the CEO analogy, imagine if Steve Jobs or Tim Cook or Patrick Collison or someone actually spent a large part of their day just doing photo ops as well. That's actually the reality about how a lot of these jobs have evolved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You have a person whose time is the single most precious asset, who because of the dysfunctional bureaucracy, his decisions or her decisions is the only thing that can actually break down the bureaucratic resistance and make sure something happens. Yet they're actually standing with the ambassador from Tonga, Zonga, whatever country, just doing photo ops for a large part of the day or going to stupid ceremonies or whatever it might be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, I think that analogy also shows some of the central problems. These people have all grown up in a system where they just don't know any better than dealing with the media for all day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if you actually understand communication, you know that communication is not the same as answering questions to the media, but that's not what they think. It's not the environment in which they operate. Also, it's not the incentives in which they work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, one of the funny conversations I had with Boris was I said, "We should say to the ministers that here's your actual priorities as defined by us. Whether or not you get promoted and whether or not your career goes well is going to be defined by how well your department actually fulfills these goals."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Not, "We don't care about all of your interviews. We don't care if you are on TV or never on TV. That's not how we're going to judge." Because they've all grown up in a culture where they think whether or not they're going to be promoted really depends on are they seen as a good media performer or do they botch things on the media?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, that's just a fundamentally bad criteria. Not least because their definitions of what's good on the media are themselves terrible. By approaching government like that, you're incentivizing them to think that their goal is making friends with the media. So then they get good interviews. That also incentivizes them to leak everything. So again, the whole culture and the incentives are self-reinforcing in a very negative way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What would happen if you said, "Okay, no more interviews." Let's just say the prime minister was somebody who agreed with you and said, "No more interviews. Ministers, you're going to do your thing. Media is out." How would the media react? Would that matter?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We sort of did that in quarter one 2020. We actually stopped participating in the number one insider elite media show on BBC radio. We just said, "We think the show is rubbish. It's a waste of everyone's time. No ministers are going to be going on it anymore." The media went completely crazy. One of the most senior people in the BBC said to me that I was a fascist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of the MPs went crazy as well, because for them, being on that show is their raison d'etre. So it was extremely unpleasant and disruptive for both the old media and the MPs who'd grown up in that culture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So how does it have to do with the fact that in the British political system, the people who are running these departments have to be an MP, so they have to be an elected official. Is that why they're so obsessed with the media? Because it's like if a congressman had to become the Secretary of State always.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's part of it. Though I would pick up on your language, which I think is important, right? Because you say the people who are actually running the departments, of course, they're not running the departments. So they describe themselves as my department, I'm running the department. The media describes them as they're running the department.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But how many people can the Secretary of State for Defence fire? Three. Three people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He legally cannot fire?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He legally cannot fire anybody else in the building.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So who can fire?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The personal three people that he brings in, that he's allowed by the system, he can get rid of those three people. The other hundreds of thousands of people in the system, he can't get rid of a single one of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the person who actually is in charge of personnel at the Ministry of Defence is the permanent secretary. I'm stressing the word permanent, right? The only person in the British state who has the legal and constitutional ability to say this person in the Ministry of Defence or Department of Education or whatever is clearly failing and they must be removed, and I order that they are removed, is the Prime Minister.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That itself is problematic, because the large part of the system will say, well, we can't just dismiss them, or if we do dismiss them, then they'll be legal. But you can actually remove them from the post.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There are complications, and those complications have grown in the last few years because of the way the legal system and various parts of the law have evolved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The PM can actually remove someone, but only the PM can. So that gives you an idea as well of the tremendous bottlenecks that occur inside Number 10.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll tell you a story about that, that kind of summarises it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In COVID, at the peak of COVID craziness in March 2020, a whole bunch of people come, in fact, actually on the day itself that the PM tested positive for COVID, a bunch of people come into Number 10, sitting around the table, and they say, we have a meeting and it's about supplies of PPE to the NHS.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, none of this PPE that we've ordered is going to be here until the summer. Okay, but the peak demand is over the next three to four weeks. Well, sorry, Dominic, but it's not going to be here. Why not? Well, because that's how long it takes to ship from China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=963" target="_blank">00:16:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why are you shipping from China? Well, because that's what we always do, we ship it from China. But A, we need it now, and B, all of the airlines are grounded, no one's flying anything. So call up the airlines, tell them that we're taking their planes, we're flying all the planes to China, we're picking up all our shit, we're bringing it back here, do that now, do that today, send the planes today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We did that, but only the Prime Minister could actually cut through all the bureaucracy and say, ignore these EU rules on blah, ignore treasury guidance on blah, ignore this, ignore that. I am personally saying do this, and I will accept full legal responsibility for everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you multiply that kind of problem by hundreds and thousands of problems, you get a sense of partly why COVID was so crazy. This is normal government, right? But in a crisis, when no part of the system can actually move fast, all of these bottlenecks end up very dramatically escalating to the PM's office.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you read Jared Kushner's book memoir about the White House, very, very similar tales there. There are a lot of things that obviously should have been solved elsewhere, couldn't be solved at any other part of the system. They all end up kind of cascading upwards in these centralized bureaucracies, because ultimately only the President or only the Prime Minister can give certain kind of orders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What if the Prime Minister or President said, I guess in this case the Prime Minister, I am giving a blank check. If I appoint you as Minister, whatever you say, I'm going to sign it. So you can rule as if I agree on everything you said. Could they write such a blank check and basically give the Minister whatever authority they might want?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1072" target="_blank">00:17:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">To some extent. So the system here in lots of ways is, in lots of ways, the Prime Minister has more powers than the President does, and is less legally constrained than the President is. Because in all kinds of gaps and lacunae in the system, there are kind of ancient assumptions that the PM is operating with the authority of the crown and royal prerogative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the PM can just do a whole bunch of things, particularly in a crisis and doesn't have to necessarily get approval from Parliament. The most obvious example of what you're talking about in COVID was on the vaccine taskforce. So I said it with others in March 2020, the normal system obviously can't deal with vaccines properly, can't do anything fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1120" target="_blank">00:18:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're watching it deal with all these other logistical problems. We have to create a completely different entity to deal with vaccines. So we essentially appointed someone and the Prime Minister said, ignore all the EU procurement rules, ignore all UK procurement rules, ignore everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You just build the vaccine taskforce the way that you want to. We're freeing you from all the normal Whitehall, HR, all the normal things which add massive friction and mean that nobody can do anything quickly. And the simplest thing is take massive amounts. To a large extent, because of the scale of the crisis, that happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But still, the vaccine taskforce was still plagued by lots of parts of Whitehall saying, well, we don't want you to do this. We don't like this. So the reality is it depends on the characters involved. It depends on how much the person the PM is empowered will actually push. It depends on the extent to which they come to the PM. It depends on the extent to which the PM then shows everyone in the system, I'm actually supporting them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And fundamentally is prepared to say, people will just be removed from that post if they don't do what they're told. COVID showed how much faster you can do things if the PM's authority is used and you could prepare to drive things through the system. And the PM is prepared to say, I will deal with legal issues later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it also showed that even in a crisis where literally thousands of people are dying, day after day after day, that large parts of the bureaucracy will still simply say, no, we are optimizing for sticking to the old rules. And that also happened an awful lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1230" target="_blank">00:20:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What I find interesting is you've written a lot after you got out of the government about all these problems. But there's other people who have been at a high level in governments in the UK, US, wherever. And it's weird to me that if there's this much dysfunction, are they not noticing it? Are they just refusing to talk about it? Have they just never been in a functional environment, maybe in the private sector or something, where they realize how dysfunctional this is?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1257" target="_blank">00:20:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why is everybody not screaming about this as soon as they get out of the government?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1260" target="_blank">00:21:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a mix, right? There's a lot of people inside the system who don't actually think of it as being dysfunctional, who just think that's their life. It's completely normal for them. So we arrive at number 10. I've taken a bunch of people who are actually experts in data science, AI, and blah, blah. We talked to a bunch of officials about projects around data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1282" target="_blank">00:21:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the officials say, "Oh yeah, well, here's some examples of some interesting projects we've done." You ask them about it. Turns out that they took two and a half years. Why did it take two and a half years? Well, the actual project took eight to 12 weeks. The rest of the two and a half years was the system emailing each other about legal permissions on what to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, from the people that I brought in from outside, this is obviously insane. No one in any normal functioning environment would spend two and a half years emailing each other to do a project taking eight weeks. But for everyone inside the system, this is completely standard. You have to realize that. And a lot of the people who are most senior in the system have been in a thing like that for 30, 40 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1328" target="_blank">00:22:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't know anything different. And it just seems completely normal to them that this is what would happen. And in fact, in 2020, for example, when we did some things very differently, it was extremely disruptive and extremely unwelcome to the large part of the system. Hence why a lot of what we did was closed down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1348" target="_blank">00:22:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So did they say, "Okay, the vaccine task force here in Operation Warp Speed in the States have been great successes. We should massively reinforce them. We should build the next generation of vaccines. We should spread the lessons of how the task force operated." No, they basically closed the task force. Sewage monitoring, closed. Rapid testing, basically closed and forgot to order enough tests the following year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look back at 2020, most of the people who were most wrong were given awards and honors by the system and promoted to new jobs. The people who were most obviously right repeatedly have almost all left. What incentive is there for people to speak out about how these things work? No one expects anything to change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1398" target="_blank">00:23:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think rationally, right? Because even after something as big as COVID, when you see what the reaction is, everyone can now see the truth. Well, you can have a one century pandemic. It can kill tens of thousands of people unnecessarily. It can be a complete carnage for the economy. And everyone will just basically go back to normal. And MPs will ignore it and nothing much will change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1427" target="_blank">00:23:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're a standard official inside the system, all the signals to you are very clear. In fact, in 2021, it was even more powerful than that. There were a whole load of legal actions brought to say that the real problem with 2020 was we went too fast and we did things too quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1447" target="_blank">00:24:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">People actually brought legal actions against the Vaccine Task Force. They brought legal actions against rapid testing. They brought legal actions against all sorts of other things. And the system didn't say, "This is completely insane." Actually, the bureaucracy and the sloth killed thousands of voters. It said, "Yes, we're going to investigate all of this." And every signal propagated through the system was essentially back to normal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1474" target="_blank">00:24:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You will be promoted for being the most insane process. And you will be demoted and blacklisted if you say this process is insane and we'll try to do better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1487" target="_blank">00:24:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so there's two things I'm curious about here. One is, what exactly in the system or who exactly is a person who decided Vaccine Task Force has to go, we can't continue it? And two, and this might be related, what happens if a PM decides I don't give a shit about these legal challenges? Pile them on if you want. Is it just going to cost a lot of lawyer fees? Why does it matter?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1508" target="_blank">00:25:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Manhattan Project is much in the news with the Oppenheimer movie. If you look at the very last bit of General Groves' book on Manhattan Project, he talks about what are the most fundamental principles about why it succeeded. And one of those principles is also relevant, they're all relevant to government. One of them is the quality of the people is fundamental.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1530" target="_blank">00:25:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Another one is that responsibility and authority are always delegated together. Now, the entire British constitutional system and management structure is based on the fundamentally opposite principle. Responsibility and authority are not delegated together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1548" target="_blank">00:25:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're asking about something like the Vaccine Task Force, in the normal system, nobody really is in charge of anything. Lots of people can criticize, lots of people can complain, lots of people can argue about things, lots of people can veto. Almost nobody ever has the authority just to build something or just to do something, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1568" target="_blank">00:26:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why did we create the Vaccine Task Force the way we did? Well, because we were trying to actually embody principles like responsibility and authority pulled together. We brought one person in, we said, "You are responsible." But once we'd gone, then what happens to that entity? It's sitting there amid Whitehall, right? And all the normal parts of Whitehall just start going back to being normal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1592" target="_blank">00:26:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what happens? They say, "Well, they are exempt from all of these rules on HR that the Cabinet Office imposes on every part of government. This should change because it's going back to normal. They have to do the following things properly and possibly." We gave them special dispensations because of the extraordinary circumstances of summer 2020, but these now come to an end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1617" target="_blank">00:26:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So those sort of things come in. The Treasury says, "Well, the spending rules and how the people in the Vaccine Task Force make decisions, well, that was an emergency thing. So now the normal rules are imposed." So before you know it, all the different parts of the system have basically said, "The thing that you created outside of the normal system now has to obey all of the things that it was specifically created to avoid."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1642" target="_blank">00:27:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1644" target="_blank">00:27:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the system will just do that automatically unless there is a very powerful counterforce. Fundamentally, again, only the PM can say, "No, we're not having that. In fact, I want to strengthen the Vaccine Task Force. We want to move on to the next generation," et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1662" target="_blank">00:27:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If they don't do that, and if the people in charge of it can't call on the PM's authority, very, very quickly the system will just devour the new entity and force it to conform with all of the normal system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1676" target="_blank">00:27:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll give you another example of this on rapid testing. So one of the things that we did to get the rapid testing to work was we got a guy who formerly was commanding officer of the SAS, British Special Forces. And this guy got a bunch of his friends from Special Forces also to work on rapid testing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1701" target="_blank">00:28:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When we first got this pushing for number 10, I got the critical people from procurement, commercial, HR, et cetera, into the cabinet room with the cabinet secretary, the single most important official in the whole country.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1719" target="_blank">00:28:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the two of us said, "The PM wants rapid testing dealt with as if this is a wartime crisis. We're going to have a second wave. There's going to be thousands more people getting COVID. There's NHS, people dying, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1734" target="_blank">00:28:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We can't have any of the normal civil service HR. We can't have any of the normal civil service bullshit on procurement. Exactly the same as with the vaccine task force, all of this must do it. Everyone sits around the cabinet table, they all nod their heads.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1746" target="_blank">00:29:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A week later, I call this guy, former SAS boss and say, "So how's it going? Are you getting who you want and everything working great?" "No. All the same shit show."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1758" target="_blank">00:29:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have to get all the people back in the same room with the country's most senior official and say, "Who the fuck have we got to fire around here to make clear that these people doing testing don't have to do all of your bullshit HR?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1775" target="_blank">00:29:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's how extreme things have to be. It was only by doing that a second time and making clear that I would get the PM to actually just start firing senior people in the Cabinet Office.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1788" target="_blank">00:29:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's only then that the system will part and go, "Okay, this element is allowed to..." But you imagine as soon as that countervailing force is removed, all the normal sea floods back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1802" target="_blank">00:30:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So at some point we should talk about what it would actually take to change the equilibrium. It might be first useful to talk about how did this come to be?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1810" target="_blank">00:30:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So presumably at some point, this is not the way the government function. How did it end up? Is it just that the kludge builds up? I've been talking about the actual mechanism of how does it end up this way?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1821" target="_blank">00:30:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, so in Britain, it started in the 1850s when people said, "Well, the old aristocratic system based on patronage is irrational. We've got to shift and we've got to shift towards a much more meritocratic system. We should have officials that are appointed on merit."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1845" target="_blank">00:30:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you essentially had a transition from pre-1850s aristocratic system based on patronage, where all kinds of dodgy corruption in various ways and favors done in various ways, but it also moved much faster and in all sorts of ways much more efficiently, particularly in a crisis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1866" target="_blank">00:31:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you shifted towards what you say is like a modern system where you have a permanent civil service, supposedly meritocratic. However, over time, you see that this supposedly meritocratic system ends up actually just being a closed caste.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1882" target="_blank">00:31:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not actually meritocratic. It's a system that promotes practically 100% internally and is therefore by definition closed to approximately 100% of the world's most talented people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1897" target="_blank">00:31:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that's defended on constitutional grounds now as, "Well, this is the only civilized, sensible way in which a state can operate." But of course, it's totally self-serving. And as we saw in COVID, it actually just means massive bureaucracy, very poor people in all kinds of critical positions, and a state that's actually paralyzed when it comes to crunch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1918" target="_blank">00:31:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like a Japanese company where you get into college and just stay until you die. You know, I mean, I live in San Francisco, and if somebody that works in like a company for three years or five years, they're, "Oh my gosh, you've been here for a while." You know, you're like a long-term employee. So the idea that you would be the same place for-</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1934" target="_blank">00:32:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">40 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1935" target="_blank">00:32:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly, is really odd.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1937" target="_blank">00:32:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And imagine, sorry to interrupt, but imagine as well what the promotion system is like that, right? And who ends up getting to the top of these systems? A lot of people say, "Oh, you're so negative about the civil service. You're all saying that everyone there is rubbish. It's not fair." That's not my view. In fact, if you look at the civil service, you actually see a lot of very able people, but most of them are young.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1957" target="_blank">00:32:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What happens is the young, excellent people get weeded out by self-selection, largely, because they go in idealistic. They're there for a few years, but then they look at what the process is to be promoted, and they look at their bosses, and the best of them look at it and go, "I don't want to be like that. I don't want to have to make those decisions. I don't want to have to make those compromises. I don't want a job like that where it's almost all bullshit. We can't actually build anything."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=1986" target="_blank">00:33:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the most entrepreneurial, the kind of people who actually want to get on and do stuff now leave, and the most HR-compliant, disastrous people to be in charge of supposedly fast-moving agencies are the ones who are promoted to take over. And then that culture itself becomes highly self-reinforcing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2007" target="_blank">00:33:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Once you get a whole cadre of leadership at the top that's like that, well, it's extremely difficult to break out of. And it's not like, okay, well, IBM has gone wrong, but then you have a whole ecosystem of competition for IBM. So, okay, IBM dies, but the American economy evolves and continues. In government systems, that obviously can't happen. So you have like, IBM is dead, but it's still actually in charge of everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2035" target="_blank">00:33:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This reminds me, there's this wonderful biography of LBJ that Robert Caro wrote. And in volume three, which is about him taking over the Senate, you know, when he gets in the Senate seniority system is known as a senility system, because you have these people who are in charge of these important committees, and they're 80 years old or something, and they're in charge of like ways and means. And so he realizes when he becomes a majority leader, like, "I can't have this. If I want to get things done, I need the young senators in charge." And so he engineers ways to get like 40-year-olds or 50-year-olds in charge of these committees.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2064" target="_blank">00:34:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2065" target="_blank">00:34:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What would it take for, could a prime minister just say, "We're going to retire everybody who's over a certain age," or just like, "We're going to retire a whole bunch of people. We see a whole bunch of up-and-comers. We're going to put 20-year-olds on the path to management or path to advancement." Who would that be up to?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2083" target="_blank">00:34:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In the British system, only the PM can do that. And we actually started to do that in summer 2020, right? So after the first wave of COVID, when the PM nearly dies in March, April, for about eight weeks or so, he was highly aggressive in saying, "This whole fucking disastrous system has got to change. It's nearly killed me. It's killed tens of thousands of other people. We've got to blow the whole thing up and rebuild."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2112" target="_blank">00:35:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in summer, we actually got rid of, I can't remember exactly, but say half a dozen, roughly, of the senior permanent secretaries in charge of all these departments. And it was described by the insiders as, quote, "a rolling coup," unquote, "fascism."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2133" target="_blank">00:35:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2134" target="_blank">00:35:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"An ultimately fascist entity is now essentially mounting a coup, an anti-democratic coup, Orban-style, to dismantle all democraticism." So that was the reaction of large parts of the old system to saying, "Half a dozen duffers are going to be removed, and we're going to start promoting some younger, more dynamic people." And that's part of an overall shift that needs to happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2163" target="_blank">00:36:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Nearly a whole bunch of different parts of the system have failed. Agencies need to be shut. New things need to be created. So it is possible to do, but the tale of that also shows the problems. The reaction from the old system and the media is very severe. Nobody supported us at all, including all the conservatives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2185" target="_blank">00:36:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2186" target="_blank">00:36:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Ironically, the people who were most in favor of it was actually the deep state itself, and the most entrepreneurial elements of the deep state, because they'd all seen the system completely implode. So the closer you were to number 10, the closer you were to actual power, the more you actually appreciated the full horror story of how the apex of the British state had completely imploded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2209" target="_blank">00:36:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so a lot of them, particularly the younger ones, said, "Well, now's the time. We've had a once-a-century pandemic. It's the biggest crisis Britain has faced since Hitler in 1945. And you've got Brexit done, and you've got the Vote Leave team in number 10 who've said before they arrived here they're going to change civil service. Okay, well, now obviously this is all going to happen."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2229" target="_blank">00:37:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2230" target="_blank">00:37:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it should happen. Now we can argue about the details of it. Clearly, the personnel system needs opening up. Civil service is going to have to have the biggest shakeup that it's had in a century or more. Fundamental problem was that the PM then thought, "This is going to annoy so many people that I can't face it."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2249" target="_blank">00:37:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, other dynamics, which I'm not sure how much you want to go into, but the fact that Starmer is just so obviously rubbish also meant that Boris and his wife thought, "We don't actually have to do very much." So it goes back to this question, "Are you actually trying to change a lot or not?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2268" target="_blank">00:37:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Our response to summer 2020 was, "We've said for years that a whole bunch of things are wrong and that the next big crisis will reveal it." Well, we've had the next big crisis and it has revealed it, and it's obvious that we're right. Now, we've obviously got to make all of these changes. And by the way, in the election six months ago, we also promised we were going to make all of these changes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2288" target="_blank">00:38:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Boris Karri and the majority of the Conservative Party's attitude was far more, "Keir Starmer's rubbish. Changing anything big will just be very disruptive and create lots of enemies. Why are all of these people talking about disruption and firing people and rebuilding things? We just want to go back to normal. We hate COVID. We don't want all these arguments about Brexit. We want to go back to normal."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2313" target="_blank">00:38:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And for them, what normal is, is like the '90s. The default mode for how people in politics think about normality is, "Can we go back to that lovely time between the fall of the wall in 1989 and the fall of the towers?" That period is what people psychologically gravitate back to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2336" target="_blank">00:38:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, in summer 2020, our attitude was, "Right. Now, the state needs to be fundamentally re-engineered." But most of the system was, "We're tired. We just want to go back to normal. We want to do what we always do, which is chat with each other, give interviews to the media, and not change much." And given that Starmer is so obviously rubbish on the other side, we don't actually have to change very much either.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2359" target="_blank">00:39:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when I hear this story, I'm thinking, "Well, you know, on your blog, you've written about all these other reformers throughout history. When they were able to make their changes was, you know, like a time of crisis, Lee Kuan Yew after the British leave, or Bismarck after Prussia loses the Napoleonic Wars." You can go down the list, right? The Meiji Reformation or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2380" target="_blank">00:39:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in this case, you have COVID, you have Brexit, you have an 80-seat majority that you've engineered based on campaigning on these things. And you have you as chief advisor to the PM, somebody who understands these things, has thought a lot about them, and in fact, accepted the job on the condition that you would be able to do these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2402" target="_blank">00:40:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you have all these things come together. Why was the opportunity wasted? And you mentioned, for example, that Boris and Kerry were not interested in changing these things. Presumably, they saw that the problem was there. I mean, if you're a PM and you're seeing these changes, you must see the craziness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2421" target="_blank">00:40:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But also, I mean, wasn't he like a fan of Churchill and he wanted to build a legacy or something? I would think if I was PM, like, most PMs are going to be forgotten, right? You might as well just like go for it and try to do something big, try to be remembered. Why did they waste this opportunity? You know, you have all these things that are going for you guys. Or if something was going to happen, that seemed like the perfect moment to make something happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2445" target="_blank">00:40:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Part of it goes back to what I said before, that you have two fundamentally different attitudes towards the whole thing. Boris was prepared to be very aggressive and revolutionary in various ways in 2019, fundamentally because he thought it was necessary for him to survive as Prime Minister. Not for the country, which he didn't care about, doesn't care about, but for himself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2471" target="_blank">00:41:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In January 2020, we were already arguing about what the fundamental direction is that we're going to go in. As I said before, my view was, we've won. We won saying we're going to do all these things. We now have to actually do all of these things. And in order to do all of these object-level things, that requires facing these very long-term, multi-decade long terms, some of them over a century, in terms of how the actual constitutional system works, how the civil service works, everything else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2500" target="_blank">00:41:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Versus his view, which is, that all just sounds like a lot of hard work and making a lot of enemies. And it doesn't really seem necessary because Labour Party is a joke. And I just want to be friends with London. I want to be friends with insiders. I want to have a nice time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2518" target="_blank">00:41:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the overwhelming majority of people in politics are there, but fundamentally prioritise social relations within the insider network. That is the most, that is just what totally dominates their life. Day in, day out, year in, year out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2536" target="_blank">00:42:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, in some ways it's very odd, right? Because you think, what's the point of doing this for 30 years? And then you kind of become a minister, but you're not actually in charge for anything. And you can't actually do anything. And then you're spat out and you're not even going to be, most of you, like not even a footnote in history. What on earth is the point of it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2555" target="_blank">00:42:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It kind of seems completely crazy to me anyway. I think that misunderstands how they see it. For them, the theatre and appearing on TV is the critical part of it, right? It's not, have you actually done anything? And the permanent civil service are brilliant at manipulating the theatre to keep the egos of the MPs satisfied.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2583" target="_blank">00:43:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the most obvious way to think about it, right, is the cabinet. You have the most famous door in the world, number 10. Every week, these characters walk up the street, the cameras are all there, the cameras work, they click, they shout out questions, the ministers smile at the cameras, and they think, we're part of the insider gang. This is the peak thing that everyone aims at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2607" target="_blank">00:43:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Whilst behind the door, the people actually running most of the government regard the cabinet as just kind of bullshit theatre. The meetings are literally scripted. People are given their talking points to read out by the officials. They read them out, they read those out, and the conclusions are all pre-written, right? So the whole thing is a complete kind of Potemkin farce.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2631" target="_blank">00:43:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But from the MP's point of view, while we're on TV, we're treated like we're in charge. Now, the fact that the people actually running the Ministry of Defence is not the Secretary of State, the fact that these ministers have like fundamentally no power, the fact that in number 10, officials who are like 28 years old, working five metres away from the PM, have usually far more power and authority over things than the ministers on TV.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2660" target="_blank">00:44:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But their names are never in the papers, no one knows who they are. This weird mismatch is never explored, it's never covered. I had a funny conversation the other day, I was talking to one of the editors of one of the biggest newspapers in the country, and I said, you know, in the old days, there used to be a parliament page in newspapers that would report what happens in parliament, right? Because that's the centre of political activity, what happens in parliament is important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2688" target="_blank">00:44:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I said, why don't you start a page where you actually report on the deep state? And you say, oh, the Prime Minister's Secretary for Economic Affairs has moved from this job to that job, and it's now been replaced by 31 year old so and so. Because those jobs actually are far more important, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=2707" target="_blank">00:45:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look at Brexit, the Foreign Secretary was almost completely irrelevant to all the Brexit negotiations. The Prime Minister's Private Secretary, a very, very, very able character, much more able than anyone in the current cabinet, totally unknown in the media, name never in the media, far more important. So I said to this editor, why don't you have a page and start that?

And that is in fact what happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5016" target="_blank">01:23:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But how come, like, why is that the implication of democracy?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5019" target="_blank">01:23:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That it'll implode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5020" target="_blank">01:23:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hmm. Hmm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5022" target="_blank">01:23:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, look what happened in Athens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5023" target="_blank">01:23:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5024" target="_blank">01:23:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They tried. It only really worked as long as you had... So I'm not saying this is necessarily what I believe, but I'm saying a reasonable perspective is, the old system worked because kind of the old aristocracy managed it. And Pericles being the obvious example from the old Alpineonidae family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5039" target="_blank">01:23:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Once they lost their grip and demagogues like Cleon took over, well, chaos, demagoguery, and endless demands on the treasury, the people voting handouts for themselves, collapses, the cycle repeats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5053" target="_blank">01:24:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5054" target="_blank">01:24:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So similar sorts of arguments about the Roman Republic, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5057" target="_blank">01:24:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5058" target="_blank">01:24:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think they wouldn't be surprised at the collapse post-war, post-1918 in Western Europe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5064" target="_blank">01:24:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So maybe an interesting question is then, you know, if you look at Bismarck, who you've done a huge dive on, or in that case, you have a system where after him, the system he set up couldn't survive and yada, yada, yada, World War I.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5079" target="_blank">01:24:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas Lee Kuan Yew, another person you've studied deeply, you know, he had meticulously set up a system so that even after he gave up the leadership, it would be a competent, successful government.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5093" target="_blank">01:24:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I guess we'll see how it turns out. But Singapore seems to be running fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5097" target="_blank">01:24:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So then is it, is it just a succession problem of figuring out, well, first of all, is, I mean, Bismarck and Lee Kuan Yew, I mean, they both are like these strong figures in the context of a democracy kind of, like, what is the correct model here? And then how does it solve the succession problem?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5113" target="_blank">01:25:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're two very, extremely different examples. With Bismarck, you have a system where there's universal male suffrage, but a kind of gerrymandered constitution written by him personally on a little Baltic island designed essentially to make him the kind of fulcrum of all of the power, but in a sort of, in lots of ways, hidden way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5135" target="_blank">01:25:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You certainly wouldn't call it democracy in anything like the current situation. And all the deep state stuff, to use the modern terminology, the army, the intelligence service and everything were obviously completely excluded from that whole power structure and completely in the grip of the Prussian king.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5150" target="_blank">01:25:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Lee Kuan Yew has created a system where, I think the most important thing he's created is a certain kind of culture amongst the leadership in Singapore. A genuinely meritocratic culture, a culture where people are actually trying to solve the problems, extremely not like Washington or London now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5173" target="_blank">01:26:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And where there's a kind of moral reinforcement for that culture, which I think is, like, without that, everything else doesn't fly. Therefore, it all becomes about, like, generation by generation, like, is that moral leadership, does that moral leadership maintain or does it dissolve?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5194" target="_blank">01:26:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it's very easy for that sort of thing to go, right? Okay, his son's in charge now, and his son seems to be, I mean, I haven't studied it very much, but seems to be preserving the fundamental culture. The people running the different agencies, their job is to actually run the agencies properly, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5209" target="_blank">01:26:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't seem to be corrupted. But it's very easy for that to change, right? Say he gets shot tomorrow or has a heart attack tomorrow and someone else takes over. Very quickly, the signals could go out. Actually, your job is not to do pandemic preparation properly. Your job is, like, here's how people will be promoted from now on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5228" target="_blank">01:27:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you'd always expect that as the default, right? Because that's just what entropy does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5246" target="_blank">01:27:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There is no such system. That's why history is what it is. The Roman Republic lasted for a few centuries, much longer than America's lasted so far, and many times longer than democracy in Western Europe so far has been operating. But everything has its time of growth and decay. And it depends on the culture of the elites. It depends on the ideas that they believe in. It depends on to what extent are they public spirited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5273" target="_blank">01:27:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When I was over in Silicon Valley, I quoted to some of the guys there, the famous letter that Cicero wrote, where he said, everything basically is going to the dogs because the leading people in the Republic are spending all their time in their wonderful houses, tending to their fishponds. And if this carries on, then the Republic is clearly doomed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5297" target="_blank">01:28:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5298" target="_blank">01:28:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he was right. But it's extremely hard to turn those things around, right? There's no reliable way to do it. How do you turn around an elite culture? I mean, what tends to happen is it implodes slowly, then hits a crisis, is blown up, and then something new comes along amid bloodshed and disaster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5319" target="_blank">01:28:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How often do you see a kind of deliberate, non-violent, non-crisis-led internal rejuvenation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5329" target="_blank">01:28:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, Will Durant has this quote that "Rome fell for longer than most empires have lasted." But we have these crises constantly. And one could have imagined COVID could have caused this. Yeah, I guess a rejuvenation will have to happen with a different generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5345" target="_blank">01:29:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Since you've brought up Silicon Valley, by the way, I do want to ask about, I think last year, or maybe was it the year before, you had a blog post about how, in America, a Silicon Valley-led or funded campaign in 2024 could have a big impact and get rid of the Trump v. Biden version 2 disaster. What happened? It seems like now you're more focused your efforts back to the UK. What came of that attempt to look into what you could make happen in the US?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5373" target="_blank">01:29:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">To what extent is things just going to play out the way that they normally do historically, i.e., slow rot, elite blindness, sudden crisis, collapse, bloodshed, chaos? That's normal. That's baseline expectation for our own current situation. To what extent can one try to preempt that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5394" target="_blank">01:29:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The only way really to try and preempt it is that you have to change the nature of the elites. And the obvious elite in America to look at is the elite who are most competent at building things. So my point was, if you leave the old system in Washington and New York to itself, then it's going to produce Trump v. Biden 2 probably. Obviously, people could have heart attacks or whatever, but left to its own devices, that's where the system is heading towards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5419" target="_blank">01:30:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The obvious set of people that could put the country on a different track are the Silicon Valley builders. You should try. But that leads to a basic paradox, which is that the more and more mad the old system of politics and the old media get, the stronger are the cultural, financial, personal disincentives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5448" target="_blank">01:30:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">To competent people getting involved. In fact, the opposite is happening. The madder the system gets, the more the competent people retreat to their fishponds. They build walled gardens and they cultivate their fishponds. They try and build their own companies where they can do things of value. They spend their time on research. They build hedge funds. They do things which are trying to insulate themselves and other people they care about from the chaos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5477" target="_blank">01:31:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And as a lot of them said to me personally, if I tried to do anything about it, then my investors would go mad. My employees would go mad. My family would think I'd lost my mind. I have demonstrators outside the house. Who the fuck needs that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5496" target="_blank">01:31:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The ecosystem is working as intended. It's closed. The old parties and the old media are driving themselves and everyone more and more mad. But the people who could change it are very highly disincentivized from getting involved. Look at what's happened to Elon, right? Elon literally, generally regarded by the old system as a hero, even only, what, two or three years ago?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5520" target="_blank">01:32:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As soon as he says, shouldn't we take the first amendment seriously? And by the way, this Ukrainian war seems insane. Super villain. And the old system now is completely full of people. A perfect way, I think, to understand the old political system in America and Europe is that across the political world, academia and the media, you can see on Twitter,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5546" target="_blank">01:32:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they're all very happy to give their personal takes on Elon Musk as manager and his startup abilities. And they take each other's take on that more seriously than they take Elon's abilities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5563" target="_blank">01:32:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, for them, they all think that they're all sensible and they're all rational. For others of us looking at it, we think that that's just a wonderful sign of the old system's complete madness and inability to face the most obvious things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5584" target="_blank">01:33:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What are junior academics and political journalists who can't even cheat their own expenses competently? Why do they think that they're competent to make judgments about Elon and his management of SpaceX, right? It's completely crackers. But they don't think it's crackers. They think it's perfectly reasonable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5601" target="_blank">01:33:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's say you did something in the UK, US, wherever, and suppose it succeeds, and it's not somebody like Boris where it's somebody you have qualms about, but better you than somebody else. Let's say it's a handpicked person you think is super competent, and you're now chief advisor again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5618" target="_blank">01:33:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Winning the election sounds like the easy bit, given the challenges you've talked about in terms of actually taking control of the government. What changes? Because I mean, last time, ADC majority, COVID crisis, a huge mandate on both counts. Still, the things couldn't happen. I mean, you know, planning reform didn't happen, a bunch of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5638" target="_blank">01:33:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What would actually take on the next iteration for you to actually take control of the government? I mean, if you have to do a natural regime change, as you've called it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5649" target="_blank">01:34:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Take me out of the equation. Let's think about the general thing. Winning an election, in lots of ways, is the easy part, right? Because in lots of ways, the madness of the old system actually makes it easier and easier to win an election.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5665" target="_blank">01:34:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the more divorced reality that the old system gets, the simpler it is to win an election just by actually focusing on the voters, which sounds completely crazy, but the old parties can't do that. Why did we win the referendum in 2016? Because we focused on the voters and the Remain campaign didn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5681" target="_blank">01:34:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why did we manage to prevail in 2019 when everyone thought what we were doing was completely mad? Because we focused on the voters. But remember, everyone thought everything we did at every stage was completely mad and stupid and wouldn't work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5693" target="_blank">01:34:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you do things that are actually focused on what voters want, to the old system, you seem insane.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5700" target="_blank">01:35:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Wouldn't you just expect some sort of basic evolutionary or almost selection argument that if even one politician, forget about a policy, just actually strategically trying to win elections, wouldn't the system at least select for that? Because that's presumably who's getting elected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5716" target="_blank">01:35:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Totally not, no. It doesn't select for that at all. The whole history of Britain since 2016 is a perfect example of it, right? We won the campaign. Did the establishment go, "Oh, how did we lose that? We controlled the question. We had all the money. We controlled all these institutions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5736" target="_blank">01:35:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We controlled practically everything with power in the country. And then this startup hobbled with all sorts of problems somehow won. Let's investigate." No, of course not. They created a whole conspiracy about Putin, Trump, Facebook, everything else as an excuse not to face the reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5754" target="_blank">01:35:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then in 2019, when we came along and we just did very, very obvious things, actually focused at voters outside London, they just made all the same mistakes again and blew themselves up again in 2019. Look at the current situation now between Sunak and Starmer. They both repeat, and Trump and Biden, all of them repeatedly every day do things that make no sense if your assumption is that they're optimizing for winning the election.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5782" target="_blank">01:36:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Why would Rishi Sunak say, "Judge me on whether or not I stop the boats." Then when he's told your whole plan and your legislation to stop the boats will not work, illegally can't work because of the European Convention on Human Rights, he just ignores it and does it anyway. It totally makes no sense if you think they're optimizing for winning an election.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5802" target="_blank">01:36:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Donald Trump, if you spent three days doing market research in America, you'd know that Donald Trump's message should be about the economy. And what he should be saying is, "This is what I did on the economy last time. This is what I'll do on the economy next time. The reason why all these legal cases are being brought against me is because people don't want me to do this with the economy." That's what his message should be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5822" target="_blank">01:37:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What should his message definitely not be? Arguing about the 2020 election and who won. What does he do? Keeps arguing about it. So these people just constantly do things which are just like objectively, all you have to do is most simple market research and you can say they are objectively not doing what is rational if you assume that they are focused on optimizing for win election.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5844" target="_blank">01:37:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Back to the question of, okay, you won. The other politicians aren't even thinking strategically about how to win. This is something that hasn't happened in a Western government in a long time. Actually, when would you say, who was the last US president who was in charge of the government? Who was the last UK Prime Minister who was in charge of the government?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5859" target="_blank">01:37:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Probably FDR, you'd say. I don't know enough about LBJ to say. My impression is that for all his amazing skills, he didn't manage to grip the Pentagon and the intelligence services and had all kinds of problems dealing with them. Obviously, in some ways, LBJ clearly had an unprecedented grip, at least since 1945, over parts of the system, for sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5886" target="_blank">01:38:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But his was a legislative talent, not an executive. Okay, so and then who in the UK would you say?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5891" target="_blank">01:38:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd say Churchill, probably.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5893" target="_blank">01:38:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Not Thatcher?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5894" target="_blank">01:38:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No. I mean, Thatcher just objectively very clearly didn't. If you look at just the memoirs of people that worked with her closely, the single biggest mistake Thatcher made was that she never actually got to grips with the permanent state, the permanent civil service. She talked about it a bit. She did some kind of sporadic occasional firings and a bit of purging here and there, but it was very half-hearted, less than half-hearted, ineffectual, and contributed to her downfall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5918" target="_blank">01:38:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's been since World War Two. The problems you've highlighted, everything from the media, to the legal challenges, to the civil service itself pushing back. I mean, we went through the entire list. How is this actually going to work? How do you actually have a government? The person who's in charge, what happens next?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5937" target="_blank">01:38:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It can't be just one person. There needs to be some subset of the elite or part of the elite currently not really involved with politics, that decides to get involved with politics, that actually decides that its fundamental goal is to solve a set of problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5958" target="_blank">01:39:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Its fundamental goal is not maneuvering the social hierarchy of ill-existing political and media elites. That's the fundamental question. At the moment, approximately everybody in the system is optimizing for their position in the social hierarchy of insiders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=5978" target="_blank">01:39:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That means that no one wants to face reality. No one wants to tell uncomfortable truths. By definition, you can't fix any of these agencies because that means alienating people immediately. All of that can only change if a set of people say, "No, here's how we define the problem. Solving this is actually what we're here for, not staying friends with the old elites."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6005" target="_blank">01:40:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why this thing very rarely happens. It's why it normally historically only happens after a disaster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6011" target="_blank">01:40:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How big does that group need to be? It's not just the PM. Is it the entire cabinet? Is it the undersecretaries? How big does that minimum group need to be to take charge?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6022" target="_blank">01:40:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything depends on particular historical circumstances. You could do it with a relatively small number of people. If you had the right PM, you could start off with 10 people, but it has to be people that have a common set of what their goals are and who are very able, and who are then able to build a network beyond that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6045" target="_blank">01:40:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It can never be no kind of coup or no kind of regime change ever happens if a small group of people at the start stays small. By definition, you have to convert people forcibly or through persuasion or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6060" target="_blank">01:41:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What is a new equilibrium for these existing institutions, whether it's the civil service or the media or whatever? Suppose you successfully reverse a lot of these trends, and there's a bunch of successes that ramp up. Do they keep opposing you, or do they support the new regime? What is a new equilibrium for the blob?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6079" target="_blank">01:41:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">By definition, I think all bureaucracies end up operating for themselves. You should assume that if you do a standard approach to this, and you say, "We don't like the existing bureaucracies. We're going to take over. We're going to scrap them and replace them." Then obviously, within not very long, those things are going to operate pretty similarly to what the old things did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6104" target="_blank">01:41:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The only way I think that there's any chance of long-term changes, you have to build into the system institutions and public acceptance and elite acceptance of a kind of constant reinvention and rejuvenation and closing and refounding of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6130" target="_blank">01:42:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the only conceivable way that over a time period like 100 years, you could imagine. If you go back to your Singapore example, so far it's been successful in preserving that culture. Here's what our real goals are, and the different elements of the government system have to change to meet those goals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6156" target="_blank">01:42:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They constantly are adapting, and we try and face our failures honestly, like their report on what they got wrong on COVID. Unlike Britain, already published, actually accepting the errors and trying to fix them already happened. Britain, we're just paying lawyers hundreds of millions of quid to spend years arguing about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6177" target="_blank">01:42:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The only way that you could even imagine something happening long-term is if you not just replace the existing elements with new ones, but you also create institutional mechanisms whereby the elites and the public accept these things need constant rejuvenation. That's a mix of basically sunsetting, closing, and rebuilding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6201" target="_blank">01:43:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's get more specific. I don't know. Let's talk about the Ministry of Defense. Would you just lay off a huge chunk of it? There's specific projects you've talked about, maybe you'd sunset, but what would it look like to refound the Ministry of Defense, for example, or any specific department?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6217" target="_blank">01:43:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What you wouldn't do, and what's doomed with that, and same as with the Pentagon, is going into those buildings and saying, "Right, let's sit down and talk about a reform program for your procurement system." It's just never going to happen, and it's never going to happen. What you have to do is you have to set up a parallel thing that says, "Here's the new procurement system that's going to deal with the following things."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6239" target="_blank">01:43:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you have to close the existing procurement system and get rid of 95% to 99% of the people involved with it. It's the only thing that has any chance of success.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6253" target="_blank">01:44:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. What percentage of the people in the current Ministry of Defense would keep their jobs? How big of a change would it require to have something?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6262" target="_blank">01:44:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">On the order of 90%. It obviously depends on department by department, different units. If you're looking at, say, across government, the place where you could be and should be most aggressive is in everything to do with communications. Everyone has massive communications teams. Everything is worse as a consequence. Lots of those should be culled by 95% to 99%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6285" target="_blank">01:44:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually did this in the Department of Education. When we went to the Department of Education, the communications team was over 250. When we left, it was less than 50. Everything had improved. If it would have been less than 10, it would have improved again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6298" target="_blank">01:44:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The examples you gave of people like Groves and everything, this is a very particular time in history, wartime, and also depression, so there's not many private sector alternatives. How would you have a situation today where you would be able to compete for that talent, not just for these really ambitious people in number 10, but across the civil service, the best and brightest are going there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6322" target="_blank">01:45:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Until that happens, is there a way to get the best possible work out of the people who are in the civil service now, who are maybe not necessarily the top of the class, but certain things need to be done?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6336" target="_blank">01:45:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Very able people are extremely interested in politics and extremely interested in government. I don't think the problem is trying to make them interested in it. The fundamental problem is that they don't want to get involved because rightly they say, "I'll just be in endless stupid meetings. I can't actually do anything."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6354" target="_blank">01:45:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of them, if you said, "Would you like to run MI6?" would think that would be a great job. Running MI6 would be a great job and more interesting even than my own extremely interesting job in Silicon Valley. But would I actually be running MI6 or would I just be sitting in a whole load of stupid meetings?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6374" target="_blank">01:46:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Similarly, whether it's health reform or anything else, could you get some of these very able people to do it? Yes, you could. We saw in summer 2020, when briefly for a few months, the whole system opened up amid chaos, there was actually incredible interest from all over of very able people wanting to come in and get involved to help, which I think is a sign that what I'm talking about is not just hope.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6402" target="_blank">01:46:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We could actually see it happening in 2020. But also what happened in 2020 is another sign. Once the system started to close back in, in quarter three, those people went back to their old jobs. If you're sitting in some very successful thing, making a lot of money in your walled garden with your fish ponds, you'll drop it if you can actually have real impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6424" target="_blank">01:47:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you can't have real impact, then you're not there to just send stupid emails for trying to get authorizations for two years. And that's the fundamental thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6436" target="_blank">01:47:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the UK, for the next four or five years, at least you'll have labor. So if you have a new startup party, and let's say it takes control after that, you have another sort of Brexit like political machine. Is that too late for some of the big crises you're worried about, whether it's if there's going to be like a financial crisis? Or one big thing that I mean, people who have been listening to my podcast, the previous guest, Dario Amadei, CEO of Anthropx, said.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6463" target="_blank">01:47:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I saw that. I watched that episode, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6466" target="_blank">01:47:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He had an exact phrasing, I don't want to mess up, but something like that can emulate a human was two to three years, right? Okay, so you have a government in five years that starts working on it in a correct way. Is that too long to solve the crises that are rising?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6478" target="_blank">01:47:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Could well be, yeah. Maybe. As you know, you see from the news, there's all sorts of things that could be, I mean, the people in charge could easily create a nuclear war in the next 12 months, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6488" target="_blank">01:48:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6489" target="_blank">01:48:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, their behavior almost only makes sense if they actually wanted to do that. Pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will. My overall assumption is failure. The Western world will go the same way that everyone else goes in history, in failure, collapse, and bloodshed. That's probably what will happen. But still, you got to try.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6510" target="_blank">01:48:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. What will you personally be doing in these four to five years before this thing can ramp up? Are you more reading and thinking?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6520" target="_blank">01:48:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There are things in education I'm interested in doing in terms of building things outside the government system that don't rely on the government. I'm thinking about the idea of creating a new political party. Someone, I think, is going to do it at some point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6538" target="_blank">01:48:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My thought has been that the normal path of history is collapse, and then people create something new out of that. It's extremely hard to avert crises. But if we're going to, then there needs to be some new political force here. There needs to be a new political force in America that can replace existing elites.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6565" target="_blank">01:49:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The fact that they're all getting so old, and that they're so visibly failing, gives some hope that it could happen. But it comes back to this catch-22 problem. The worse the system gets, the harder it's becoming to get able people to get involved with politics, not easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6585" target="_blank">01:49:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The whole idea of a new party and the whole idea of doing politics differently, everything fundamentally rests on whether or not you can get able people to step forward and do it. History suggests that's phenomenally hard, that normally that only happens after the crisis comes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6607" target="_blank">01:50:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Speaking of which, if you were doing a new party, you had to get these political talent to hop onto your party's label. It's sort of a catch-22 because you need voters probably to convince the political talent to join your party. You need the political talent to attract the voters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6625" target="_blank">01:50:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6626" target="_blank">01:50:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What is the trick to getting these people to ditch the existing system?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6631" target="_blank">01:50:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, in the first place, it's extremely hard. When I did some research in America recently, I asked about the third party thing, and you see this problem come straight through in focus groups. People say straight away, "I hate both the old parties. They're both obviously rotten. They both obviously can't do a good job. We obviously need something new. America's got so many wonderful people. Why the fuck have we got all of these ancient, old, useless people in charge of absolutely everything? It's all a nightmare."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6660" target="_blank">01:51:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Okay. So imagine the following party comes along and it's got the following people and it says the following things, what you think, and people go, "Oh my God, that would be so great." But I'm not sure if I would vote for it. Why not? Well, because my vote might be wasted and it might let the crazy people from the other side in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6679" target="_blank">01:51:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So even if you imagine this wonderful new entity run by the best and brightest in America with an agenda you actually agree with, even then you might not vote for it because you fear that it might let the... You see, so there's a fundamental structural problem with the first-past-the-post system. Now, I'm in favor of first-past-the-post system. I'm more interested in getting rid of it, but it does make it structurally very hard to replace one of the old entities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6706" target="_blank">01:51:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's why the whole Brexit thing was such an incredible missed opportunity because we could leverage off winning the referendum, the chaos that that created, the collapse of both the old parties in 2019, one of the parties coming to us begging for us to save them, us going into number 10, having the majority.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6727" target="_blank">01:52:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, like we kind of maneuvered the system into such a place that we could actually then transform one of the old parties into the new thing that we wanted to build. That's very hard, but it's easier than creating something new and then taking over in a first-past-the-post system, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6744" target="_blank">01:52:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">On Brexit, so if it's possible to build a new political machine that's relatively cheap to do and is much more effective than the current political parties at winning elections, what is it that you did in Brexit and that you would do? Maybe this is a separate question of what you would do or what somebody might do in a future election.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6763" target="_blank">01:52:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But whether it's like political modeling, whether it's the use of new technologies or, I don't know, like testing things out with social media, like what are the tricks that you would use to win elections?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6777" target="_blank">01:52:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, obviously all the AI stuff means there's huge opportunities there, but I would stress, Colonel Boyd, people, ideas, machines, and that order. Why was it that we built tools to help win an election that no one else built? The primary question is that we really wanted to win and we really were focused on the voters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6798" target="_blank">01:53:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why we actually built tools. The old parties aren't focused on the voters and aren't really interested in what they've got to say. Therefore, that's just not what they are thinking about every day. So I don't think the most important question is the technical side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6814" target="_blank">01:53:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's, can you create something with very able people that really, really wants to obsess? Jeff Bezos-like obsession on the customer that we want to focus on the voter. If you can build that culture, then that culture will then build the technology and will exploit the tools 100 times better than the old parties will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6838" target="_blank">01:53:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6839" target="_blank">01:53:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's that that comes first, not the technology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6841" target="_blank">01:54:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">With Brexit, afterwards on your blog, you're writing about why you did Brexit and similar to the things we're talking about where the government is dysfunctional in these ways, we've got these crises that can happen in minutes. How similar in retrospect do you think that is to the message that Vote Leave, the organization you chaired, advertises the reason for Brexit?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6859" target="_blank">01:54:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One way you could say is like, oh, it's customer obsession. What is the customer here interested in? Is it important for the two to be the same? The reason you want to do Brexit versus the reason that you might advertise Brexit should be done?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6872" target="_blank">01:54:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think any kind of mass communication always involves like huge simplification and huge focus, right? It's just, there's an unavoidable aspect of things. So, forget me and Brexit, like anybody doing politics, there's always like, same with Bezos running Amazon. It's, yeah, it's customer obsessed, but there's also a whole bunch of stuff that he's not talking to the customers about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6894" target="_blank">01:54:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6895" target="_blank">01:54:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think that's just intrinsic to politics. The vast majority of what you're thinking about, what you're talking about, are not going to be the focus of public communications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6904" target="_blank">01:55:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, how do you think about the bargain with voters where, is it like, I have these long-term priorities and the voters want this thing, which I don't really care about, but it's almost like a trade where, help me achieve these long-term priorities or give me the power to achieve these long-term priorities. And these are other sort of like smaller things, which I don't think are the most important thing. We'll also accomplish those. Is that the way you think about it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6927" target="_blank">01:55:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">To some extent, that's always what politics is, right? Because as I said before, that you could only ever talk about a relatively small fraction of all the things that you think are important. Also, bear in mind, right, take civil service reform. Civil service reform isn't even a subject of interest to the insiders who have to live with it all day. I mean, I actually have more conversations with people outside politics about that than I do inside politics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6955" target="_blank">01:55:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Seems very weird, right? But the people inside the system are so completely, just accept the existing system, but they don't even really talk about that. So, like, is a new party going to spend a huge amount of time discussing the intricacies of HR for how some kind of new service should work, how to create red teams inside Whitehall, how to create a startup for a drone army to replace parts of the MOD? No, because most people are not interested in all of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6984" target="_blank">01:56:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But neither are the insiders, right? Neither are the people currently, the thousand most powerful people in the country now also don't think about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=6991" target="_blank">01:56:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">While we're talking about talent, you obviously put out that famous post saying we want weirdos and misfits to come into government. There's lots of weirdos and misfits out there. What is a specific kind that is really effective in government?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7004" target="_blank">01:56:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there are lots of different kinds, right? It depends very much on what you're doing. I mean, some of the people we brought in were very technical. For example, you're interested in the whole AI world. There were some very, very technical AI people. It massively depends on the particular roles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7020" target="_blank">01:57:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's another set of talent which is rare inside government, which is just a kind of like entrepreneurial project management typey, actually getting things done character. No surprise that we ended up in a crisis having to use British special forces for a lot of those kind of things, because they're pretty much one of the few elements of the British state that is still extremely able.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7046" target="_blank">01:57:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And has that kind of like operational, punchy, can get things done fast vibe. So, it's just highly dependent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7055" target="_blank">01:57:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is a war over Taiwan with China worth it for the US and the UK and the West together?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7060" target="_blank">01:57:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously not. It's a completely insane idea. It's an island that you can see from the Chinese coast. It's full of Chinese people. The people in the army are cousins of the people in the opposite army.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7071" target="_blank">01:57:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7072" target="_blank">01:57:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For decades, we've had one China policy accepted by Democrats, Republicans across the Western world. It's going to be unified, but it should be done peacefully, not violently. That was the right approach. It's completely crazy for us to be ditching that approach and to be willfully antagonizing China over a place filled with Chinese.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7096" target="_blank">01:58:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7097" target="_blank">01:58:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's fucking stupid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7099" target="_blank">01:58:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it has worked in the past where, you know, with the Soviets, they had the huge Red Army on Europe. And with, you know, nuclear deterrence, we were able to keep them from conquering the rest of Europe. Why not just have this sort of thing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7111" target="_blank">01:58:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What your parallel is that, so we threatened the Soviets to say you shouldn't invade Germany and France and Britain is a parallel to say that Taiwan shouldn't be part of China. That's a really bad analogy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7123" target="_blank">01:58:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What's wrong with the strategic ambiguity where we haven't committed to defending Taiwan, but just making China think twice about invading Taiwan?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7132" target="_blank">01:58:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Britain gave strategic ambiguity a great run out in summer 1914. How did that work out? So you want to repeat that with nuclear weapons where the crisis can kill like a thousand times more people and happen like a hundred times faster than happened in summer 1914.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7149" target="_blank">01:59:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7150" target="_blank">01:59:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Over an island filled with Chinese people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7152" target="_blank">01:59:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Having lived through a hinge point in history, how does that change how you read, let's say you're reading about World War I or something?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7159" target="_blank">01:59:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, also it's just not credible, right? Like, do you think the Chinese are sitting there thinking, okay, we know that Taiwan is completely existential for us. And America also thinks it's existential for them. No, of course not. Of course, that's not what they're thinking because it isn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7176" target="_blank">01:59:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can't just go around threatening nuclear war over something where it's not actually a credible threat, where people think either it's complete bullshit or they are actually insane.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7191" target="_blank">01:59:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, but that is this entire strategy behind mutually assured destruction as well, right?

There the argument for America was, we are defending the Western world. We have NATO. There is a NATO agreement on mutual self-defense. And if you breach that and you attack one of us, then it means war against everyone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7218" target="_blank">02:00:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, that was a lot, lot, lot more credible than there's a little island off the Chinese coast of absolutely like, it's nothing to do with us historically at all. It's full of Chinese people, but we're going to threaten potential nuclear war over it. It's totally non-credible. And doing it makes you sound mad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7238" target="_blank">02:00:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was talking to a friend about this and he was defending extending the nuclear umbrella to Taiwan.

You spent time in Russia when you were a younger man. You were trying to start an airline there, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7267" target="_blank">02:01:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7268" target="_blank">02:01:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What did you learn about Russia? And do you think the regime there is long run stable?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7272" target="_blank">02:01:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I learned a lot of things doing it. I learned that Russia is a mafia state. I learned that London was treated back in the mid '90s, as the Moscow taxi drivers called it, the laundry for the mafia state. Something which people here have not wanted to face because there's a lot of money to be made out of the whole enterprise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7297" target="_blank">02:01:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Even in 2021, when I said that this is crazy that we're still doing this, there was a lot of pushback, literally months before the Ukraine war started. It was completely normal in London to defend the way in which we've handled the whole thing for the last 20 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7313" target="_blank">02:01:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I also learned about incentives a lot. So everything I had to do with the airline was a total fiasco. And one of the things I figured, I learned was I, like many naive Westerners, got involved with it thinking, well, the people obviously want to make the airline work, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7334" target="_blank">02:02:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the whole point of having an airline, that it's a successful airline. Wrong. Actually, what most Russians wanted to do was steal from the airline and move the money offshore. And I never realized that. And a lot of the people involved with it didn't realize that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7353" target="_blank">02:02:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's very easy for Westerners. Russia was full of Harvard MBA types flying in from JFK and arriving in Russia thinking that it was some kind of vaguely normal country. And they, like me, learned the hard way that it is not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7372" target="_blank">02:02:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That lesson with incentives, for example, is it isomorphic to other institutions you've seen or was that specific to Russia?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7380" target="_blank">02:03:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, it's more crazy and insane. Everything is crazier and more insane in Russia. But I think, I mean, it definitely helped me deal with, you know, you always learn a lot, I think, from total failures and having to confront the fact that you just like totally misunderstood what on earth you were getting into.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7399" target="_blank">02:03:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I completely misunderstood what I was getting into there, like at every level. So I think it was very useful for me, actually, when I came back to Britain and then got involved with politics, I was much more careful about, like, trying not to fool myself and trying to figure out what's real. And not necessarily question my own assumptions about things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7422" target="_blank">02:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. Speaking of which, a character you've highlighted who exemplifies that sort of epistemic humility, Bismarck, and you're going to deep dive on him. So I just want to ask you a bunch of questions, not only about him, but maybe just the study of history in general. First of all, where in the world do you think Lee Kuan Yew or a Bismarck type figure emerging as the leader of that country? Where do you think that's most likely today?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7445" target="_blank">02:04:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I can imagine someone like that emerging in... I mean, actually, I can imagine someone like that emerging in China or Russia. Actually, it's much harder to imagine someone like that emerging in Britain or America or the Western world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7461" target="_blank">02:04:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How come?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7462" target="_blank">02:04:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, they'd be crushed by the system, right? You can imagine in China, some Machiavellian character coming through the CCP. I mean, in some sense, you could say, like, you know, Xi has done that to some extent. A Machiavellian character comes to exploit the system in a kind of, like, somewhat mafia way, manages to take over, and then Stalin-style starts, you know, purging people and manipulating the whole thing so that they acquire more and more power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7491" target="_blank">02:04:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, the good thing about the British and American system is that it's proved quite resistant to that sort of thing. But that hits upon a fundamental paradox, right? That our systems have been good at preventing the kind of catastrophe of Stalin-type person taking over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7512" target="_blank">02:05:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the very characteristics that make it very hard for Stalin to take over also make it, like, chronically incompetent as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7521" target="_blank">02:05:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah. Or hard for a good statesman to take over as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7525" target="_blank">02:05:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When we're talking about different periods of history, you are somebody who's actually lived through and participated at a high level in a hinge point in history with, you know, masterminding Brexit and then as chief advisor during COVID.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7538" target="_blank">02:05:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What is it that you now understand about how history is written that you, when you were looking back at previous periods, how do you, like, think about what is written versus what actually happened, knowing how your time has been described in the press and in contemporary accounts?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7554" target="_blank">02:05:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, almost everything, like, close to 100% of the things written about me, what I was trying to do, what I thought, what I said, what I wanted to do, what I actually did, like, approximately all of it is complete garbage. So, it obviously affects how you see everything else. It can't have any other effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7576" target="_blank">02:06:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was true in the Department of Education. It was true in the referendum itself. It was true in number 10. So, it definitely makes me much more skeptical about all kinds of details, I think. Like, whenever you read history, it definitely makes me think all the time, "Yeah, but, like, that might easily be wrong," and what else was actually happening behind the scenes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7602" target="_blank">02:06:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, just, like, how much is lost to it, right? If I think about my own time in doing the referendum or in number 10, like, close to 100% of, like, the reality of conversations and motivations and calculations is basically lost to history. Like, none of it was really recorded anywhere. I mean, there might be some sketchy WhatsApp conversations here and there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7625" target="_blank">02:07:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The odd person keeps a diary, which can be useful for sure, but it was pretty rare, certainly amongst top people. I mean, even if they keep it, I think they destroy it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7639" target="_blank">02:07:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah. Especially, we're in an age where so much is recorded, even if you don't try to, whereas if you look back at, like, Bismarck's time, there's not, you know, emails and so forth that you can dig up, so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7652" target="_blank">02:07:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a bit of a paradoxical, though, because I'm not sure. So, now, those guys were constantly sending letters to each other, right? And a lot of those letters do end up surviving because they just defiled in some paper archive somewhere, and then 60 years later, there's a war and people get their hands on them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7667" target="_blank">02:07:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For us, though, like, how much of key people's WhatsApps between, you know, Jared and Trump or me and Boris or all these sorts of things, like, how much of that digital archive actually will be saved and accessible? Like, arguably less than in the old days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7685" target="_blank">02:08:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You were at the Give a Talk or participated in a panel at the Orwell Foundation about Bismarck, and you had a quote there that I thought was so interesting, and I want you to explain it. "Bismarck's partly a story of how intelligence tries very hard to escape all constraints, and all attempts by less intelligent people to force higher intelligence to align with certain goals and values are at best highly uncertain and dangerous." What did you mean by that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7711" target="_blank">02:08:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it was prompted by studying Bismarck at the same time as having a lot of conversations with people about the whole AI alignment problem and whatnot. And it just occurred to me one day that it's an interesting exercise to consider Bismarck's career through the prism of the AI alignment arguments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7732" target="_blank">02:08:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, here are all the safety features that we're going to try and create. We can constrain it in this way, we can constrain it in that way. If all else fails, we can try and kill it, can we switch it off, et cetera, et cetera. But if you look at his career, like, you basically see, you see the AI alignment problem, like, just actually living. You see something that's much more able than its competitors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7756" target="_blank">02:09:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it defines success fundamentally as expansion of its own power, which also means its own freedom of maneuver. And it treats all attempts to align its goals with broader goals as enemy action to be destroyed. And it's highly effective at preemptively destroying them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7778" target="_blank">02:09:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it deploys, people try and send the intelligence services to close it down. It ends up taking over intelligence services and using them to blackmail its opponents and force them into suicide and exile. At every stage, every attempt to create safety features is defeated. And the ultimate thing of, like, to switch it off, switch it off as people start writing letters all across Europe. Essentially, they're saying switch it off, but they can't switch it off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7806" target="_blank">02:10:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What kind of works at the end, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7808" target="_blank">02:10:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it's human, so it gets really old.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7810" target="_blank">02:10:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. But who was the Kaiser that kicked him out?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7813" target="_blank">02:10:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the end, the Kaiser says, "I think I can do without you." The Kaiser was wrong, of course. And everything immediately started going downhill for Germany thereafter. And in some weird ways, also parallel to the AI argument, a lot of the key people around Europe started sort of wistfully saying, "Well, you know, it was a nightmare to deal with this terrible superhuman AI, but it wasn't a pirate. It wasn't insane."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7842" target="_blank">02:10:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you could at least negotiate surrender.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7845" target="_blank">02:10:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7846" target="_blank">02:10:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right?

Another analogy here is it set up all these things that nobody understands, these systems of alliances and relationships in Europe. And you can imagine like an AI advisor and you're not sure what's going on, but it's making, I don't know, maybe it's like a hedge fund manager that's AI and it's making a lot of money. And then you're like, "But I don't trust it. I'm going to shut it off." And then a few years later, there's a huge financial collapse because it was doing something you didn't realize that was super important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7882" target="_blank">02:11:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You shut it off. You didn't understand what it was doing that was super important. You turned it off. Suddenly all the shit that it tried to do goes to shit and you have World War I.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7889" target="_blank">02:11:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Your interpretability program that's running across it doesn't really work. It can't really explain to you why it's doing these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7899" target="_blank">02:11:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7900" target="_blank">02:11:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you think, "Oh, well, it all looks a bit murky. I'll close it down." And then, yeah, then you find out that actually the structure of the build was super valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7907" target="_blank">02:11:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's great.

Not very well known, but it's by far the best.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7923" target="_blank">02:12:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, big picture, what is the cause of Britain no longer being the global superpower it once was? Is it decolonization, post-war socialism? Is it the war itself?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7937" target="_blank">02:12:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The productivity stuff started happening after 2005, but people have been talking about England declining for a long time. What is the big picture cause of that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7945" target="_blank">02:12:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the most important thing, obviously, is World War I. At the end of that, naval dominance gone, huge financial reserves poured into the mud of the trenches in France. I mean, all of Europe. I mean, Europe's never recovered from it, never mind just Britain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7968" target="_blank">02:12:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7969" target="_blank">02:12:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that was the single biggest element to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7974" target="_blank">02:12:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Wasn't it like one in eight British men between like 20 and 40, or it was maybe even higher than that, died?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=7981" target="_blank">02:13:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In the years afterwards, saw the biggest transfer of property in Britain in basically 500 years since Henry VIII separated us off from the Catholic Church, the dissolution of monasteries, and that huge shift in the 16th century. Like it was 500 years, and immediately after World War I was a similar kind of epic shift as a consequence of that, like the scale of death.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8007" target="_blank">02:13:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You also see that echoed in those blogs on Alan Brooks' diaries through World War II. It's interesting, he keeps referring back to it as well, where he's constantly bemoaning another military disaster and why the British army is not working so well. His answer is, well, of course, like a whole generation of great leaders was destroyed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8025" target="_blank">02:13:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm curious why the opposite thing isn't more common, where you have all these generals who have seen World War I, maybe they're better at fighting World War II as a result. I mean, it seems like, I don't know, Hitler was a World War I officer. And yeah, I mean, the World War II generation did seem special. Did the World War experience help with them in any way?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8044" target="_blank">02:14:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know, and I'm not an expert, but it's striking that the view of contemporaries was lots of the best young people were killed. And that's why now a lot of the senior echelons are not up to the job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8057" target="_blank">02:14:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One thing you've emphasized a lot over your writing and throughout your entire career is the need for basic research as a way to move England forward and maybe move the West forward. But when you look at like England's GDP per capita, it's far behind the U.S.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8072" target="_blank">02:14:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And one thing I was wondering about is like, maybe it makes sense for the U.S. to be doing a lot of basic research to expand the frontier, but Britain doesn't even seem to be on the frontier at this point. If it's just about economic growth, shouldn't it just be copying the things that already work in the U.S. instead of doing a whole bunch of basic research and hoping in like 20 years or something it contributes to productivity growth or something?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8093" target="_blank">02:14:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The answer is not simple, right? Britain needs to do a whole bunch of things. So some of it is frontier research, but that's only part of it. Part of the reason for that also is not just economic growth, but also security and national independence, et cetera, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8110" target="_blank">02:15:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How much of Europe in 20 years' time is actually going to have meaningfully independent capabilities in lots of areas? And how much of its choice will only be do we buy American or do we buy Chinese? Like if Britain wants to have its own choices, then it's going to have to build things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8127" target="_blank">02:15:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The science and technology staff is important for us to develop, but not just for economic reasons, but it's also very, very far from a magic bullet, right? There's a whole bunch of stuff that we have to do and that we started work on in 2020. The zoning laws are a crucial part of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8146" target="_blank">02:15:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The whole ecosystem around startups, right? So the applications of the research, that whole ecosystem is a nightmare in all sorts of ways. And it's one of the reasons why constantly great startups here end up selling out early to American companies. All of that needs dealing with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8168" target="_blank">02:16:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's just massive regulation of area after area after area, which throttles growth. The whole housing market is a complete shitshow. I mean, everywhere you look is bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8182" target="_blank">02:16:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Given that most attempts at fighting NIMBY and red tape and overregulation have failed, even the one you attempted to fix planning, aka zoning in the UK, when you were chief advisor, what is the correct strategy to fighting NIMBY? Because it just seems really hard to fight it head on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8201" target="_blank">02:16:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think a lot of people look for a magic bullet of communication, whereby we come up with some equivalent of take back control, but for planning, and then we persuade everyone and the public will shift and start cheering house building. I don't think that's realistic. And I don't think that's the answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8220" target="_blank">02:17:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, in 2020, we did actually make some changes to the planning laws, but I think it's instructive how we did it. We didn't talk about it at all. I actually basically had a communications blackout on the whole thing. And it's because talking about it is extremely hard to do, even if you're very good at communications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8239" target="_blank">02:17:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was completely pointless trying to do with that number 10 and that prime minister and that conservative party. So my approach to it then was just do it, don't talk about it and talk about other things. And so we did actually manage to get various things done then, but without most people even noticing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8257" target="_blank">02:17:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think overall though, if you're really trying to do at a big scale, the actual answer is that you just do it. You focus public communications largely on other things. When people actually see the effects of it with growth and houses they can afford and businesses starting and growing and thriving local areas and whatnot, then you can point to that, but you're not doing it in a theoretical way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8286" target="_blank">02:18:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not politicians promising things. It's being able to point to real change in their areas and say, look at what's happened. Now, do you want to go back? Do you want the people who don't like this to take over? You see what I mean? I think the idea of coming up with some kind of agenda on it and then trying to persuade the public about mass deregulation and mass housing is a fool's errand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8309" target="_blank">02:18:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, let's talk about education a bit. You mentioned earlier that that's one of the things you're working on now, but also you have a big history here. You were at the Ministry of Education and while there you wrote a very interesting report on an addition education. And this is one of the quotes from that that I thought was pretty compelling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8330" target="_blank">02:18:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"We need leaders with an understanding of Thucydides and statistical modeling who have read the Brothers Karamazov and the Quark and the Jaguar, who can feel Kipling's Kim and succeed in Tetlock's Good Judgment Project. An addition education focused on humans' biggest and most important problems and explain connections between them to train synthesizers." This is a very interesting idea. Do you want to explain a bit about what the idea behind the addition education was?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8358" target="_blank">02:19:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Politics is the hardest thing. It's the most complicated. There's a reason why it's just constant failures. Much harder than the hardest startup. The people who can do well at it at the top level, you need to be able to look at lots of different things and have some kind of sense for them if you're just looking at it from a narrow perspective.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8379" target="_blank">02:19:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So generally speaking, the people who are doing it have done like history degrees or politics, philosophy, economics degrees, Oxford type stuff. And then they've gone into the world of politics and government. And it's just an incredibly narrow way of looking at the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8398" target="_blank">02:19:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It means there's huge skills that you don't have, intellectual skills you don't have, practical skills you don't have. You don't understand how things actually get done. You don't understand how regulation actually has its effects because you don't see at the coalface what it's like starting a business or scaling a business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8421" target="_blank">02:20:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">My view is much stronger having been in number 10, that what I wrote 10 years ago was correct. Especially having gone through COVID and the horrors around that. The way to deal with that is to have different kinds of skill, different kinds of people with different kinds of skills. But you also need some people who can look across multiple domains at the same time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8448" target="_blank">02:20:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think it's not a surprise, for example, that one of the most useful people in COVID was someone who'd done a physics PhD, was now working in AI, but had also built a business and had worked with that business in Whitehall. So they could see, they could understand a lot of the actual, they could understand some of the difficult science around COVID.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8472" target="_blank">02:21:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They knew what it's like actually running a business. They understood the interface between business world and the government. They were familiar with all of those different worlds. And that meant that they were much better able at looking at the overall problems than the average MP, the average senior official, the average special advisor, et cetera, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8494" target="_blank">02:21:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">- Is this ability to synthesize across fields, something that you can actually train in, like something analogous to Plato's Academy, or is this just that you have to hire people who have it? Because the reason I ask is, one thing I was thinking while reading this, you have a lot of famous examples in history of scientists and mathematicians, you know, the scientists who understand like very complicated things, but they don't understand like the very basic insight in like Hayek's knowledge problem and they're socialists, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8521" target="_blank">02:22:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or they don't understand the basic game theory and they're pacifists. Where it's just like, you know, they understand, they can understand complicated things, but having that sort of ability to transfer between, I understand power laws, therefore I understand like the power of scaling and AI, or I understand exponentials, therefore I understand how bad a pandemic could be. That's, you know, that's like an additional thing that's hard to train.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8543" target="_blank">02:22:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">- It totally depends on temperament and personality, right? Two of the most interesting intellectual people of 20th century are John von Neumann and Kurt Gödel, who were both friends, fled Europe because of the Nazis and ended up in Princeton. Both extraordinary minds, both did things of stunning originality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8565" target="_blank">02:22:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">John von Neumann was completely at home in the world of Washington, could also go and deal with bureaucrats and navigate the corridors of the White House, give presentations to politicians, understood how let's have a pre-meeting about this in order to make sure that so-and-so understands that. And so then the question is presented to the president in the white order so that this guy doesn't say that before this person says that, et cetera, et cetera, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8589" target="_blank">02:23:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All the kind of political skills you need to actually get something done and avoid your meeting turning into a shit show. Kurt Gödel is like the opposite. If you're going to put people on a graph, Kurt Gödel would be like the exact opposite end of that, right? Famously totally useless in every practical way and menace to himself. So yes, you want people with great intellectual ability, but as you say, some of those people can be highly functional in a political environment and some of them are completely catastrophic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8618" target="_blank">02:23:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. But it seems like, I don't know how you'd train a John von Neumann because then he also assisted the US in thinking about like Cold War game theory and things like that. Whereas is it just easier to hire those people? And actually maybe a different way to ask this question is, does the UK train these sort of generalist, maybe generalist is not the right word, but like technical people who can synthesize across fields? Is it just that they're trained in the UK, but they go to the private sector or emigrate?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8645" target="_blank">02:24:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or is it just that the UK doesn't train them to the same extent as like the US does?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8651" target="_blank">02:24:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think elite universities now definitely don't train this sort of thing. The way that I think about it is this, it's easy to imagine creating new courses for like 17 to 23 year olds where they do a much broader mix of intellectual subjects, where they study a broader mix of intellectual subjects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8673" target="_blank">02:24:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They read some through CDs, but they also understand some basics about statistics and tech-lock type stuff. But also you shove, instead of them just sort of going off to do, waste their time in some holidays, they also go off and work at SpaceX or some kind of startup or with the military or in a hospital ward, ER room. And they're moving between these worlds of the theoretical and the intensely practical constantly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8702" target="_blank">02:25:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that will be to everyone's temperament. Some people have a temperament where they find that interesting and they'll get a lot of value out of it. A lot of people won't. So you have to think of it in multiple legs. So one thing is create those courses and that will find you a set of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8718" target="_blank">02:25:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's another set of people who are, let's say Tim Gowers, Fields Medalist, mathematician at Cambridge, right? He's gone through one whole thing. Now, are you going to send him off on some course? No. But could people like that be brought into government to help in all sorts of ways?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8738" target="_blank">02:25:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8759" target="_blank">02:25:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, they could put us in that environment and it would be unfair on everyone and them to involve them in it. But Tim Gowers would be a good example of someone who personally could cope with the environment and I think would bring great value to it. So it's not, I don't think there's just one thing, right? What we need is multiple experiments with different pathways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8780" target="_blank">02:26:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of it is bringing in older established elite talent and then mixing them up in the system. Some of it is training younger elite talent differently. There's no magic bullet to it. You have to try a bunch of things at the same time. Some people will respond very well to an odd mix of theoretical intellectual pursuits and intensely practical things. And that is definitely something worth trying to train and definitely can be trained.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8808" target="_blank">02:26:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How does PPE, politics, philosophy, economics, how does that fuck up the people who go through it? Because I mean, basically, is it like almost every prime minister has gone through it? And even US presidents, Clinton was a Rhodes Scholar and he went through it. What is the way of thinking it instills that you find problematic?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8827" target="_blank">02:27:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it just, it encourages this kind of word cell bluffing, basically. That everything becomes just a sort of, that is like, oh yeah, like you spend a week, you skim through a few books, you come up with some like vaguely plausible stuff. And if you seem, you know, with a bit of, you know, with good manners and a bit of social polish, then suddenly it all seems plausible. And you're all surrounded by people who operate in exactly the same way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8855" target="_blank">02:27:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have a room full of polished social word cells. It's just a very, very, it's a very bad set of people there to throw a problem like COVID. And also, it encourages them to think that the kind of like the plausible sounding few sentences to get through this conversation is actually what's important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8880" target="_blank">02:28:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Rather than what's the truth? What's the actual answer to the problem? How are you actually going to implement this over many years? Like everything like that is completely disdained. And it points to a general problem with our system, right? I found it just all, like one of the most important things is that everything to do with like operations and management and actually getting things done is like the lowest status thing in widespread knowledge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8909" target="_blank">02:28:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the lowest status thing in Whitehall. The highest status thing is A, bullshit about political strategy, inverted commas, and media and giving interviews. Everyone wants the word strategy in their job title. And it's practically always like bullshit in their job title and shouldn't be in the job title. The job will be approved by removing the word from the job title.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8929" target="_blank">02:28:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And nobody wants to be on logistics, operations, and actually making sure that something happens. And that's at the core of why so many things work the way they do. And you can even just see it like in the whole policy process, right? The highest status thing is writing the policy and then spinning it to the media.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8952" target="_blank">02:29:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The totally lowest status thing is what are the actual implementation details? Like has someone already tried to do this in like eight different countries in the last four years? And each time it's been a disaster. Like no one cares about that. That's left to much lower status jobs and none of the senior people will pay attention to it. And they're actually just like formally separated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8973" target="_blank">02:29:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the things that we did in 2020 was we said, in summer 2020, one of the ways in which the number 10 system should change is the policy people should be brought together and actually physically sit with the management people, which was completely revolutionary idea. Because that way, when you're thinking up the ideas in the first place, you're immediately from the beginning talking to the people whose job it is like, will this actually work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=8998" target="_blank">02:29:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Rather than what happens now is these people sit around, they go to bullshit seminars, they talk to journalists, they talk to MPs, they publish a paper. It's actually full of holes. It doesn't work. That paper then goes off to the implementation people. The policy people then move on to whatever their next thing is. The management implementation people look at it and go, well, this is not going to work for all the following reasons, but it's their job to make it work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=9020" target="_blank">02:30:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They then have to go back and then start arguing with, but we already decided that we were going to do this like nine months ago. Yeah, but it can't work. So our idea was, if you put it together, then you'll actually find out on day one or day four, oh, actually, this is a stupid idea and it won't work for the following reasons. We have to do it this way instead. No one cares about that. It goes back to like, what do people care about? No one actually cares if it doesn't work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=9044" target="_blank">02:30:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, the OODA loop is broken, right? It's like you're debugging a program, but you can only do it a month after you write the program or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=9051" target="_blank">02:30:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, exactly. Imagine if you could only debug the program like 18 months after you wrote the program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=9055" target="_blank">02:30:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What do effective altruists and rationalist types get most wrong about politics?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=9060" target="_blank">02:31:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't understand how low the caliber of the people are in politics. They don't understand like a fundamental golden rule, which is the people in politics almost never actually trying to solve the problem and don't care about solving the problem. I have constant conversations with ER types where they think that the political people they're going to talk to really care about solving problem X, which is fundamentally incorrect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=9087" target="_blank">02:31:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not surprising that a lot of their plans go wrong. I think that they are also susceptible to the idea that elites are more rational and the voters are more dumb and easily manipulated by emotions. Whereas in fact, the truth is the exact opposite, in my opinion, that it's educated elites are by far the easiest to manipulate with emotional propaganda and the voters are much tougher to fool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=9116" target="_blank">02:31:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=9117" target="_blank">02:31:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think the rationalists think it's the other way around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=9119" target="_blank">02:31:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Conventionally, you are seen as or thought of as combative. I mean, in this interview, you've been very polite and pleasant and everything. But does the fact that you're seen as combative, does that help you, you know, maybe get your way when you're in government or something? And is it calculated?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=9135" target="_blank">02:32:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not calculated. I don't know if combative is the right word. I think the fact that people inside the system know that I actually do have priorities and I do actually care about them. And I don't care what the media says. And I have an extremely high tolerance for everyone going crazy in order to actually get what I want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=9160" target="_blank">02:32:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Definitely, obviously it has an effect because people think, well, maybe we should do a deal with him. He cares a lot about blah. Maybe we should just let him do blah and see if we can persuade him like to, you know, we'll help you with this and maybe you could help us with something else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=9178" target="_blank">02:32:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Having priorities, actual priorities is incredibly rare in politics. Almost no MPs have them or practically by definition. Not worrying what the media says and not worrying about everyone hating you, I think is a very powerful advantage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=9195" target="_blank">02:33:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Insiders constantly say all the way through referendum and all the way through number 10, these people are just completely crazy. They don't know what they're doing. It's all going to fall down on their heads. That definitely was an advantage because it just means that they constantly fool themselves and undermine what they were doing. And they didn't learn from 2016. The mistakes they made in 2016, they just totally repeated in 2019.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=9221" target="_blank">02:33:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in a system where people don't have priorities, don't actually care about policy, somebody who does, it's got to seem strange to them in their world. Okay, final question. What does pessimism of the intellect and optimism of the will mean to you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=9237" target="_blank">02:33:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look at history, then you have to expect that what happens to everyone else is likely to happen to us, i.e. disaster. But that's not a reason for giving up. You have to try even though you don't think it's going to work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=9251" target="_blank">02:34:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Dominic, this is a huge pleasure. I honestly learned so much. I mean, you really can't get this anywhere else. Having somebody who is as thoughtful as you inside government so that you can have both a sort of higher level intellectual picture, but also the level of detail and knowledge of what actually happened and the strategy and information of it. It's just like I couldn't get it from any other interviewee. So this is a huge pleasure. I really enjoyed this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA&t=9275" target="_blank">02:34:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you so much.
