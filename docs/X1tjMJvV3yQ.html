important factors is your job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=6" target="_blank">00:00:06.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Most people, however, don't think strategically enough about their work and how they want it to help build their life to be more intentional.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=14" target="_blank">00:00:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Today, I want to talk about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=16" target="_blank">00:00:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll start by sharing four common traps that people fall into when it comes to thinking about their jobs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=23" target="_blank">00:00:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Then I'll offer an alternative model that will help you put your work to work on making your own life deeper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=31" target="_blank">00:00:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And don't worry, at some point in here, I will throw on my technology theorist hat and rant a little bit about technological distraction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.340</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll always get that in there in an episode of the Deep Questions podcast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">We're talking jobs today, so let's get started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=43" target="_blank">00:00:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so what is the first trap that people fall into when they think about their jobs?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I call it the passion trap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.300</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're a longtime fan of mine, you know about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I wrote a whole book about this back in 2012 called So Good You Can't Ignore You.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The passion trap is when you believe that if you match your job to your true passion, you'll be happy and satisfied in life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So this idea that if you just follow your passion professionally, you'll be happy is something that was invented by the baby boomers in the 1990s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.900</a></span> | <span class="t">As far as I can tell, here's what happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">The baby boomers had two different experiences with work within their same lifetimes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Early in their working careers in the 1960s, they had this experience of countercultural life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">There's this idea that work doesn't matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Go live on a commune.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Find meeting through alternative ways of living.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That didn't work out too well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.260</a></span> | <span class="t">That sort of began to—it was idealistic, but that was not sustainable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Then in the 80s, there was this economic boom when they were having kids, and they all made a lot of money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Their stocks went up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They bought houses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was good because they had money, and money is good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But it was also kind of over the top, and they felt sort of bad about it because it was kind of greedy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.220</a></span> | <span class="t">It felt sort of financially rapacious.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So what they did for their own kids is they said, well, let's just—let's try to combine these two worlds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Money is good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We remember from the 60s, living in the mud with, you know, your friends at the commune is not great, but greed gets it out of control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So what if we say you should work, you should care about your job, you should make money so you can buy a house, but the job should also fulfill you and be your source of meaning like our countercultural ideals were.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">They tried to combine the idealism of the 70s with the economic opportunities of the 80s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">They put this all into one phrase, follow your passion, which messed up the generation to follow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's the reality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Regardless of the content of your job, that is, what field you're in or what your job does, the day-to-day is pretty similar between most jobs, especially in the knowledge sector.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You can work in the front office of the Washington Nationals and love baseball, but you know what your day-to-day is going to be?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Spreadsheets in a cubicle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not going to look that different than if you were in claims processing and AGI, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Most jobs in the end are answering emails, looking at PowerPoint slides.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So the idea that the subject matter of your job is going to give you all this happiness and satisfaction doesn't work for most people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, trap number two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Call this the grand goal trap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea here is that if you can just make it to a sufficiently impressive grand goal or level of achievement in your job,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.420</a></span> | <span class="t">be this becoming a law partner or a full professor or a best-selling author, then you'll find happiness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">If I can just make it to this level, everything is going to work out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason why this is a trap is that often the pursuit of grand goals tramples other areas of your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you're trying to pursue becoming a law partner, that might be taking away so much time from, for example, your family or your friends or other things that are important to you that overall net-net your quality of life is actually much lower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Grander goals tend to balance the rewards of the accomplishment as well with more work and more stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So simply thinking if I can make it to this level of achievement, then I'll be happy is often a trap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, the third job-thinking trap is what I call the FU money trap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">The FU money, of course, being a term, I believe James Clavel maybe introduced it, but it's the idea of having so much money that you don't have to worry about work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You can do whatever you want to do in your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So the FU money trap says the key to professional happiness is making so much money that you can live like a baller without ever having to work another day again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, here's the problem with this way of thinking that, like, look, I'm suffering now, but if I can just kill it in the stock market or kill it in selling my company or just save up so much money that I never have to worry about earning money again, here's the problem with that belief.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">A, it probably won't happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very difficult to earn FU money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.100</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of luck involved, and there's a very narrow number of fields in which it's even a possibility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, it turns out not having to work doesn't automatically solve your problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't necessarily make your life much more intentional, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of what you're looking for to make your life better has nothing to do with whether you're working to not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, there are aspects of people's work that's important to their sense of satisfaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can actually go backwards by removing work from your life too haphazardly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's also a lot of, and this is crying me a river, but there are a lot of unique stresses that come with having a lot of money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So just this idea that if I get the big payday, then I'll be happy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Look at all the miserable kind of weird Silicon Valley billionaires and centimillionaires, and you'll see it's not so simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, the final trap in thinking about money is what I call the bohemian trap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's kind of going the other way here in terms of accomplishment and ambition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">The bohemian trap says, look, regular jobs, W-2 jobs are poison.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">You will be happier if you can cobble together one-off jobs, freelance jobs, various types of 1099 income, just kind of cobble together different things, do a little consulting here, do a little working over here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">That somehow is going to be this much more romantic, freer, flexible style of professional lifestyle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's the

health insurance that's just taken care of as part of your employment package.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The amount of sort of freelance or cobbled together work you have to do to be able to simulate that much steady income and that level of health coverage is actually a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It

toolbox for building a life closer to this ideal vision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.060</a></span>

your number with your job, you can begin trading your skill for other things like time and flexibility and be completely comfortable with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=2345" target="_blank">00:39:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You need to produce the information from scratch as if lecturing a class without

that's where you begin to get a big variance in things like activity load.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=2642" target="_blank">00:44:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">It's complicated, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=2645" target="_blank">00:44:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Because part of what happens is kids need to do things, but it's possible for kids to do too many things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=2652" target="_blank">00:44:12.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's a hard balance to actually try to figure out, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=2655" target="_blank">00:44:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So part of it depends, for example, on school.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=2658" target="_blank">00:44:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">If your kid, for

<span class="t">Like one of the big three private schools in the D.C. area, they're going to be slamming them with homework starting middle school and onwards.</span></div><div class="c"><span

being taken up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=2670" target="_blank">00:44:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But on another school, the schoolwork might be minimal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=2672" target="_blank">00:44:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's like, yeah, I want to make sure that they're they have something to do during each season, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=2677" target="_blank">00:44:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So you kind of have to find that balance, but they're going to have to do stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=2680" target="_blank">00:44:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And the more kids you have, the more it multiplies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=2683" target="_blank">00:44:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">My wife and I like

target="_blank">00:44:50.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And if they don't get outside, they're going to they take a sledgehammer to our walls, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=2695" target="_blank">00:44:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, they're just going to they're just going to smash through all the windows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=2698" target="_blank">00:44:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's good discipline and it's good for them to have coaches and other adult role models around them that they can model off of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=2705" target="_blank">00:45:05.180</a></span> | <span class="t">We like our kids to try to play some sort of instrument, but it's pretty casual, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=2709" target="_blank">00:45:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Our school doesn't have an

that feels like multiplied by three is too crowded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=2724" target="_blank">00:45:24.200</a></span> |

things, their social skills being missed and they're going to be bored and kind of bouncing off the wall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tjMJvV3yQ&t=2755" target="_blank">00:45:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's kind of a hard thing to balance out.</span></div><div class="c"><span

different more than when the kids were young and it's more survival mode, just making sure they get, you know, we know where they are and they're fed and aren't too bored.</span></div><div
