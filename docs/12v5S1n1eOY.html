In many cases, for AI, many of these customers, their first AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">deployment was actually with Boxx because, of course, many enterprises worry a lot about data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">security concerns and worry about data leakage with AI, make sure to do safe and secure AI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and this is one thing that we have specialized in over time. But the way that we think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">AI is at a platform level. So we have sort of the historic version of Boxx which has the idea of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">global infrastructure, sort of everything you need to manage and maintain content at scale. We've got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.280</a></span> | <span class="t">over an exabyte of data, we have an awful lot of hundreds of billions of files that our customers have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">trusted us with, and we have the natural way to protect them in addition to the type of services that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you provide when you're an unstructured data platform. But then for the last few years, one of the key</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">things we've been investing in has been in AI on top of the platform, and I'm here to tell you a bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">about our journey here. So we started our journey in 2023, shortly after AI became sort of production</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">ready from a generative AI sense. And everything I'm talking about here today will be generative AI, of course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So we ended up with a set of features, things like QA across documents, things like being able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to extract data, things like being able to do AI power workflows. Happy to talk about these in general,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but today I'm going to focus on one aspect of the features that we built, which is the idea of data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">extraction. This is the idea of taking structured data from your unstructured data and using that in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">an enterprise setting. And partly I'm going to focus on this one because this is interestingly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like maybe the least agentic sort of thing that you might think of when you're thinking about these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">other examples about how you interact with AI. This is much less like a standard chatbot style</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">integration, but what we learned and what I'll tell you about is how you the concepts of agentic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">capabilities applies well beyond just sort of end user interactions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll be talking about data extraction for a moment, just a quick background. When we talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">metadata or data, we talk about the things in unstructured data, be it documents, be it contracts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">be it project proposals with anything that then turns into structured data. This is a very common</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">challenge in enterprises is that they have like 90% of their data is unstructured, 10% of their data is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in databases, structured data. And historically, there has been this challenge that like it was kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">hard to utilize this. So many customers have for a very long time, wish they had better ways to automate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">their unstructured data. And there's a lot of it. And it's really critical. In some cases, it's the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">critical thing in an enterprise. So the things you do with it would be to like query your data, being able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">kick off workflows, being able to do just a better search and filtering across all of your data. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">so this like the prototypical example, this is something like a contract where you have an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">authoritative unstructured piece of data, but then also the key fields in there are very important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is not a new thing. For many, many years, the world for box included has been interested in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">pulling out unstructured, structured data from unstructured data. And there were a lot of techniques</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to do this. And there's a whole industry. If you ever heard of IDP, this is like a multi-billion dollar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">industry whose job in life was to do this kind of attraction. But it was really hard, you had to build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">these specialized AI models, you had to like focus on specific types of content, you had to have this huge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">corpus of training data. Oftentimes you need to get custom vendors and custom ML models that you make.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was quite brittle. And then to the point, not a lot of companies ever thought about automating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">most of their most, their critical unstructured data. So this was sort of the state of the industry for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">very long time. Like just don't bother trying too hard with unstructured data, do everything you can to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">get it in some sort of structured format, but don't try too hard to deal with unstructured data. Until</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">generative AI came along. And so this is where our journey sort of begins with AI is for a long time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we've been using ML models in different ways. And the first thing that we tried when confronted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">with sort of a GPT-2, GPT-3 style of AI models is that you just say, I have a question for you, AI model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">can you extract this kind of data? And as we mostly all know, AI is not only great at generating content,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it's also great at understanding the nuances of content. So what we did, we first started out with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">some pre-processing, doing sort of OCR steps, classic ways to do this, and then being able to then say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to extract these fields, standard AI calls, single shot, or with some decoration on the prompts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And this worked great. This was amazing. This was something where suddenly, a standard, generic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">off-the-shelf AI model from multiple vendors could outperform even the best sort of models that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">had seen in the past. And we supported multiple models just in case, and then it got better and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">better. This was wonderful. So this was flexible. You could do it across any kind of data. You could,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it performed well. It was, yes, you had to do OCR and pre-process it, but that was straightforward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we were just thrilled. This was like, for us, it was like, this is a new generation of AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And interestingly, we would go to our customers and say, we can do this across any data. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">they would give us some, and it would work. And then we'd be like, great, AI models are awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=393" target="_blank">00:06:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Until they said, oh, now that you do that well, and I get it. Now, what about this one? What about this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">300-page least document with 300 fields? What about this really complex set of digital assets?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to get these really complex questions associated with it. What about, I want to do not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">just extract data. I want to do risk assessments and things that are these more complex fields. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">start to realize, huh, like this, as a human, when I, if you ask me that question, I'm struggling to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">answer it. And then in the same way the AI struggled to answer it. So suddenly, we ended up with more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">complex documents. Also, OCR is just a hard problem. Like, like there's no seemingly like no end of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">heuristics and tricks that you do on OCR to get it right. So I've got a scan document, somebody writes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff in it, somebody crosses stuff out. It's just hard. And then, and then for people who have dealt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">with like things like different file formats, PDFs, like it's a challenge. So whenever the OCR broke,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it would just naturally give that info to the AI and then languages were a big pain. And so we started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to get more and more challenges as we have an international set of customers across different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">use cases. Also, there was a clear limit to the AI in terms of how much it could handle the attention</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to so many different fields. So if you say, here's 10 fields, here's a 10 page document, figure it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">They're great. They're most of them are great. If you say, here's a 100 page document, and here's 100</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">fields that are each of them complex with separate instructions, then it loses track. And I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">sympathy because people would lose track too. And so this became very problematic because if you want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">high accuracy in an enterprise setting, like this just starts to not work. And then also it's just like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">well, what is accuracy? What does it mean? In the old ML world, they give you confidence scores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">0.865 is this one. And then, of course, large language models don't really know their own accuracy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So we would implement things like LM as a judge. And we'd come back and tell you like, here's your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">extraction. Also, we're not quite sure this is right. And then our enterprise customers would kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">of be like, well, that's helpful to know. But like, I want it to work right. Not just you tell me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it doesn't work right. And so this became this kind of set of challenges that we focused on. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">customers were looking for speed. They're looking for affordability. They're making this work. They're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">saying, if AI is this future awesome thing, then like, you know, show it to me. And so we're in on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">these more complex documents. So at this point, we kind of hit our despair moment. Our, we thought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">LLMs were the solution to everything. We thought that like, we could have these AI models that worked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But then we actually struggled. Like, what do you do now? How do you fix this? And I know, let's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">wait until the next Gemini model or, you know, OpenAI seems to be on top of this. So like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">wait till the next one, which is part of it, right? The models do get better. But the fragility of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">architecture was one that was, we weren't really going to be able to solve on our own. So naturally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the answers that we came up with was bringing agentic approaches to everything that we do. And this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is really the one of the key things that I want to sort of bring out in this session is that it certainly was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">not obvious that the way to fix all these problems in something like data extraction was to do agentic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">style of interactions. And when I say agentic, I mean, an AI agent that does something like this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I am on instructions, objectives, with the model background tools, we can make have secure access,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of course, it has memory from the purposes of advancing and being able to look up information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">inside of the system, but also with a full directed graph. So the ability to orchestrate it to be able to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">things like where you say, do this, then this, then this, either it comes up with its own plan, or we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">actually can orchestrate it ourselves, because we have knowledge of what we want to do. And this was for us,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">um, I mean, it's controversial, like, it was like our engineers, like, what are you talking about? Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">let's just make the OCR better, like, like, let's just add another step somewhere, like, let's just add a post-processing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, regular expression checks. And then, and then, of course, everybody always like, I have a way to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=633" target="_blank">00:10:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this, um, based on the old way of doing this. Why don't we make training ML model? Like, why don't we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">fine tune? And then, and then, and so suddenly, all of the genericness of it would be get lost in this process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, we came up with a mechanism, which was a, uh, so this is, uh, I think, like, kind of land graph</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">style of agentic, uh, capabilities. And, um, so we still, we went, uh, we still had the same inputs and outputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">In document with fields, out answers. However, the approach was an agentic approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, um, you know, we played with all the models, uh, reflecting, uh, back and forth and criticism,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, being able to, uh, uh, separate it in multiple tasks, uh, to be able to have different multi-agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">systems work on this. And we ended up with something like this, where you have a step where you prepare</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the fields, you go through, you group the fields. We learned quickly that, like, if there's like a set of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">fields that are like customers, uh, from a contract and then are like, uh, like parties,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and then somewhere else there's like the address of the parties, like you need the AI to handle those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">together. Otherwise it's like, you have three parties and two sets of addresses, which don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">match. So we, so we had to break up intelligently the set of fields. We had to go through and we had to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">um, uh, uh, like, uh, uh, do multiple queries on a document. Then after we got that, we would then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">use a set of tools to check in and double check the results. In some cases we use OCR. We would then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">double check it by looking at pictures of the pages, um, and, and, and using multiple models. Sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">they vote and they're like, wow, like, this is a hard question. Three, three models from different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">vendors. Uh, two of them think this is the answer. That was probably a good answer. Um, and then on to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">idea of the LM as a judge, not just a judge to tell you that this is a, um, this is the answer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">but a judge to tell you, uh, Hey, uh, here's some feedback, keep trying. Now, of course this takes a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit longer. Um, but, uh, this is something that then leads to the kind of accuracy that you'd</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">want overall. And so for us, this was the, um, the, uh, uh, the architecture that then helped us solve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a set of problems. And it became, um, interesting because every time there was a new set of challenges,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the answer was not rethink everything, or let's then try like a whole new set of like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, we're gonna give us six months and we'll come up with a new idea. But, uh, I wonder if we change</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that prompt on that one note, or I wonder if we add another double check at the end, then we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">actually start to solve this problem. So we bring the power of AI intelligence to help us then solve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">something that we used to think of as a standard function. Um, and then not only that, it helped us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in other ways. Like, so we were naturally as an unstructured content store, like one of the first things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you always see people, if I can give you a demo right now, it's, I have a bunch of documents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a question. And then we had the same thing that a judge and it'd be like, you'll tell us like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, that was a good answer or that wasn't. And then why not just, if it's not a good answer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll take another beat and, and tell the AI, like, uh, try again, before you tell the user this answer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">like, I want you to, um, uh, like reflect on it for a second. And this kind of thing just leads to higher</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">accuracy. And then it also leads to much more complexity. So we just announced our deep research capabilities on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=812" target="_blank">00:13:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">your content. So in the same way that like open AI, uh, or Gemini does deep research on the internet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we let you do deep research on your data inbox would look something like this. So this would be like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">roughly the, the directed graph that you'd have where you'd go through, you know, first we searched for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the data, kind of do that for a while, figure out what's relevant, double check, then make an outline,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of prepare a plan, go through, um, uh, make, make a, a process. And this is all agentic thinking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And it, and, and this kind of thing wouldn't really be possible if we hadn't kind of laid the front,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the framework of having an agentic foundation overall. So, um, I will leave you with, uh, these,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, a few lessons learned here. Um, so this is based on our time in the last few years. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the first is, uh, that, um, it wasn't obvious to us at first, but the agentic, uh, abstraction layer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">from an architecture perspective is actually quite clean. It is, it is very, um, once you start to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">think this way, it is very natural to think, I'm going to run an intelligent workflow, an intelligent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">directed graph powered by a models are every step to be able to accomplish a task. Not everything,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">but sometimes that's a great, that's great approach. And this, and this is independent of some,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of a high scale set of, of, uh, sort of distributed system design and, and, and both are important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Like at some point you have to deal with, you know, a hundred million documents that day at the same,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">other point you have to deal with that one. And so being able to separate these two systems into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like somebody who thinks about the agentic framework is somebody who thinks about the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">how to scale a generic process is this is, this is very helpful to keep these distinct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, also it's just easy to evolve. Like, uh, in that deep research example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">one of our biggest, we, we, we, we did it and then it worked really well, except for the output</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">was kind of sloppy. And so we were like, ah, I guess we gotta redesign the whole thing or add another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">note at the end to say, summarize this and according to this. And it would just take that in and just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">redo the output. So not that long to fix. And this was something that was not obvious to me until later,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which is that, um, if you're going to be using, um, a agentic, uh, uh, AI with a team who's been around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">for a while, like you start to need to get them to think about agentic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">first kind of thinking AI first thinking. And one way to do that is to, um, let them build something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">so that they can start to think, oh, like this is not only how we can build more things, but also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">because we're also a platform for our enterprise customers, they can think about how to make it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">better, make it better for them. So things like, uh, really doubling down on the idea of, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">we publish MCP servers. What are the tools like for them? What can we do to make it easier? How can we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">do our agent to agent communications and so on? So, um, this is, uh, all kind of summed up with is if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you're confronted with a challenge, the lesson that we learned is that if it's plausible that a set of AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">models, uh, could help you solve that problem, then you should build this AI agentic architecture early.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">If I go back in time, I would wish to be done this sooner because then we've kind of, uh, have been able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">continue to take advantage of that. Um, and so that's my, uh, that's my journey and that's my, my, my lesson</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">three. Uh, so thank you. Uh, Ankur, are we, um, two minutes? Okay. So, um, if anybody, what? Two questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. If anybody has any questions, I'm happy to answer them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, question being, is this available as API? Yes. Um, so we're very API first oriented, so we have an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">agent API that you can call upon these agents to do things and give them the arguments. So yes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, we, we, we provide, uh, uh, uh, uh, agent, uh, just APIs across everything and tools, um, to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to call our APIs. Um, uh, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Were you primarily just evaluating your agents to develop on this dashboard or on their links?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you explain when you start using, uh, a more manual approach as well? Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In terms of valuing our agents, uh, and how do we do that? Um, so we, we not only use, uh, LM as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">judge, but we also create an eval set. So we have our standard set of eval sets. Um, and then we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">learned that, um, since the AI gets so good over time, we created a challenge set of eval sets to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">so that we can better explore like things that not everybody asked, but if they did, it would be really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">hard. And then that way you can better decide on whether or not you're not only prepared for now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">but as people get more challenging things, we, we know that we can grow across that. So a mixture of eval sets,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">plus LM as a judge, plus the idea of just having people give feedback. We, we have limited ability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to look as an enterprise company, what's happening, but, but the, the idea of them telling us this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">still useful in all cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1081" target="_blank">00:18:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you can yell if you want, I'll hear you.

Yeah. Asked a bunch of the floor and you would talk about that. It seems like you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">mostly building agents, but he's going to get out of the box, you know, center fine tuning. Why are you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">supposed to put it? Uh, so the question being, why bother with agents if you can fine tune a model? Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">no, no, I'm just saying, have you tried, have you tried fine tuning? Yeah, we're, we're, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we're pretty anti fine tuning at this moment because, um, of the challenges of once you fine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">tune something, you have to then fine tune all of the evolutions of them going forward. We support</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple models, Gemini, Lama, uh, open AI, Anthropic, and it's just hard to consistently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">fine tune across the board in ways that like not only they've been usually just the next version of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the model gets better. So we've, we've got, we've gotten to the point where we use these prompts or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1128" target="_blank">00:18:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">cache prompts or agenticness as opposed to fine tuning. That's the approach for our particular use cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12v5S1n1eOY&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">It works quite well.
