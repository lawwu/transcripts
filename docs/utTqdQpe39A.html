But what we really want to actually do within GitHub is not only incorporate some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">of the new features and capabilities within co-pilot only, but we also want to incorporate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it as part of the platform. So, everything within the platform itself will start having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">AI in it. So, today, you've heard a lot about co-pilot. Obviously, we're at an AI conference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you didn't, that would have been a bad thing. But with collaboration, productivity and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">security, those are some of our biggest aspects of the GitHub core platform capabilities there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">From pull requests, as you heard some of the code review things that were happening earlier on.

How do you get that momentum going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">from a productivity perspective? And then, security. Security, I feel like, hasn't been talked about as much in terms of how can we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">how can we improve app sec with AI rather than just how do we talk about security around AI. Security around AI is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">probably something talked about all the time from legal to privacy to everything in between. But what we want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">do at GitHub is to also incorporate AI to make sure that security is also being progressed along with the new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">capabilities that we're seeing today. And everything that GitHub does, we want to do it with scale. We want to build our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">integrations and our APIs. So anything that I've talked about today is generally API backed or there's a third party integrator that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">also comes in and helps with a lot of the capabilities. There's never one path that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">solves all the answers. So we want to make sure that all of our customers, you know, have a path away to a solution, have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">path to that solution. Today, if you didn't know, actually, this might be not the latest numbers, actually. But I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">think the numbers are more. I haven't updated the slide in a while. But there's over 100 million</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">developers registered on GitHub. There's 4 million organizations, 90% of the Fortune 100 companies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which sometimes I'm surprised by the numbers because I know everybody uses GitHub. But like 90% of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Fortune 100 is mind blowing. I work with customers day in, day out. But this is still mind blowing to see,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">because that is how we get a lot of our feedback. That's how we get a lot of our community part of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">conversation. That's how we build a lot of our features. Anything that we do, we incorporate that community</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">back into the conversation. By means of introductions, I'm Sarah Khalifa. I'm a principal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">solutions engineer here at GitHub. I've been at GitHub for about four and a half years now, which is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">long time for GitHub's life. And it was pre-copilot, pre some of the capabilities, almost pre-actions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">if you use actions. So, you know, we've seen the platform grow a lot during the last couple of years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But like I said, the community is what really makes it the biggest, better platform across the board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Our customers, our vendors, our partners, everybody that is part of that conversation is how we really get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">into the next iteration of what we're going to build. And I'm lucky enough to work with a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">customers. So I'm working on the customer side of things. All my customers today are financial services,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">but over the last four and a half years, I've been working with all types of customers from all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">different parts of the industries outside in this enterprise world that we live in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So I did a quick introduction of what is the GitHub platform today. We talked about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">co-pilot, but that's only one aspect. We talked a little about collaboration. You heard about it earlier</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">on through Christina and Chris's session. You also heard a lot about productivity, especially with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">copilot being in that conversation. But today we're going to talk about GitHub advanced security and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">how we're incorporating AI into that. If you haven't heard of GitHub advanced security, don't worry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to cover what is GitHub advanced security. And then we're going to talk about some of the new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">features are coming along that are the AI aspects into advanced security. And then we'll do a live demo,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">because as you can see, all of our GitHub teams here love doing live demos, even if they don't work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">or if they work better than they expect, which is a very great example of what happened in the earlier session today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So we'll be focusing on one aspect of the platform, and then we'll be talking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">specifically security. So how can we incorporate security in our day-to-day work? And then how can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">AI improve that experience for developers? Who here has used GitHub advanced security? Anybody?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Nice. A couple people. So what is GitHub advanced security? So GitHub advanced security allows you to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">incorporate, think of it as your AppSec aspects into your developer platform day in, day out, and has that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">GitHub experience. So when we talk about advanced security, we have code scanning. Code scanning allows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you to do SaaS and other types of code scanning within the developer platform, within the GitHub ecosystem,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to find vulnerabilities and detect different patterns that are vulnerable to then help remediate them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">faster. With code scanning today, there are two aspects that I would say are the more popular aspects</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to talk about. And we can talk about a lot more if you want to come to the GitHub, Microsoft and GitHub</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">booth later on. But code scanning today allows you to detect vulnerabilities using code QL, which is our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">internal or proprietary language, I guess, but it's open source. So you can actually build it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">your own queries yourself. But with code scanning today, it allows you to detect different vulnerable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">patterns across your code. We'll find the data flow and be able to analyze that data flow to understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">where the vulnerability is, and what type of source and exploits you have within that vulnerability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that makes it super powerful, especially when we talk about some of the AI aspects that we're adding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to it, because we have the context and we have that information in there. With code QL today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">there are more than I don't even know how many query packs that we offer internally or from the GitHub</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">side. But we also bring in that community. So anything that we do is community backed. And sorry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I keep hitting the mic. But anything that we do is community backed. So when we talk about code QL,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not just our queries, it's Microsoft queries, it's Google's queries, it's Uber's queries, and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And we build that aspect of community in even in security, just because we know there's never going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">be GitHub is going to answer every single question that you may have, especially for the companies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that you work for. The other aspect of code scanning is to incorporate third party integrations. So again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">this is where our vendor and partnership comes through. So if you're using something like container</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">scanning, code scanning today, code QL specifically is more focused on SaaS.

So anything that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we do with advanced security, anything that we're doing with AI allows you to really add that aspect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">into it.

So what we're doing, we're doing, and think of it as an AI analysis of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the repository to understand if that password is a true positive. So what we're doing is finding passwords,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and we label them today as other because they are definitely going to have some false positive in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">them in the first iteration of this. But it's going to identify those passwords and make it easier for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you to say, hey, these are actually vulnerable passwords that we have exposed in our Git history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So we need to revoke them, rotate them and start storing them in our Azure core vault or Azure key</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1018" target="_blank">00:16:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">vault or wherever we want to.

This is going to be a game changer for passwords that aren't really very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">structured in general that allow you to do things that you shouldn't be storing in a Git repository.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1036" target="_blank">00:17:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is, again, where it's a way of AI helping finding and discovering easier, much more easily than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you could have before. So the easier identification, faster remediation. So the easier you can identify,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the faster you can remediate it. But let's go into a demo. So I have about maybe like 10 minutes left</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">here. So really quickly, I kind of want to just start off with a GitHub repository here or a GitHub</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">organization here. You can see there's a security tab at the top of your GitHub organization. If you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1072" target="_blank">00:17:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">admin access or if you're there's a security manager role as well, you'll be able to see the security tab.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1078" target="_blank">00:17:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">If you have GitHub advanced security on, it will actually give you a lot more information. If you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1081" target="_blank">00:18:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">don't, you'll have some dependent upon information going on here. But this security tab gives you an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">overview of all the information that you have across this organization. So in this example here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">what you're seeing is that there's so many open alerts. This is our demo repository. This is a production</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">code. So do not worry. This is not going to be deployed anywhere in Azure. But we are safe for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">today. But nonetheless, 73,000 alerts is a lot. But you can identify these alerts and find more patterns</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of what's going on based on the secrets. If it's secrets being identified or if it's vulnerabilities from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">your SAS scanning or if it's vulnerabilities from your third party integrations or if it's dependency</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">vulnerabilities from dependabot. So you can see a lot more information and statistics on, hey, what's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1128" target="_blank">00:18:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">age of some of the alerts? These alerts have been living for a long time. What's the remediation time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">timeline? How often are you remediating these? How often are you actually resolving these? And then you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">can understand the impact analysis of all the different repositories. This is one of the views.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So my actual favorite view is the coverage view. Because the concern for a lot of customers is like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1151" target="_blank">00:19:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">how do we know what we don't know? So in many cases, people believe that they have full coverage of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1158" target="_blank">00:19:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">everything. But it's usually done in CI and in the CI pipeline. So you're not actually getting coverage</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">unless you're going through a CI pipeline. But there's so many more repositories that probably are just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">sitting there for just basic automation, something else that you're just running that it's not going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1172" target="_blank">00:19:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">through your CI pipeline. So you're never actually running security scanning across all of those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this view here, you can get a true identification of how many of your repositories are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1181" target="_blank">00:19:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">actually covered. So you can see secret scanning, code scanning, and dependabot. In many cases,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">secret scanning is an easy one-click button on. So obviously, there's just a lot more coverage across</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">secret scanning, 99% here. We're hopefully going to get 100 at one point in time. But for code scanning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1197" target="_blank">00:19:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it's 57. What do we need to do? Why is it 57? Does it make sense that should we not be scanning more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">things with code scanning? And that's where I think this provides really the best value.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1208" target="_blank">00:20:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's from an organization perspective, or an admin, or if you're a security manager.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1212" target="_blank">00:20:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">As a developer, I want to go into my repository, similar to your repository. You can see a security tab</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">here. This security tab really allows you to understand what's going on across that specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1222" target="_blank">00:20:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">repository. So let's go into one of these here. So I'm in my code scanning repository here, or sorry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1229" target="_blank">00:20:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in my repository in the code scanning alerts here. I can see all of the alerts listed out where I need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1235" target="_blank">00:20:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to start fixing. So this is a lot more reactive work. We found these vulnerabilities. How can we start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">fixing them? We have a big backlog. We have some tech debt. This is a place where I'm going to go and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">understand what's going on. So then I can go fix those. So when I go into one of them, for instance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1249" target="_blank">00:20:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">actually, let's go into this one here. When we go into one of them, for instance, we can see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1254" target="_blank">00:20:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">specifically what the vulnerability is. So if we click on show paths, you can see from source all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1260" target="_blank">00:21:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">way down to the sink of what the vulnerability is. So as a developer, I can understand that where I need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to start fixing these vulnerabilities. But in many cases, there's more than one way to an exploit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1272" target="_blank">00:21:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">There's more than one way to get to that exposure point. So how do we identify that and understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that? That's what CodeQL does really well. It identifies all the different paths. So if I go into maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1282" target="_blank">00:21:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">step eight, it looks like there's a different source, but it's the same sink in this example. So why not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1288" target="_blank">00:21:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">actually fix a vulnerability in step seven? So then I can find the common denominator across all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1292" target="_blank">00:21:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">those. So that is the more reactive work. What we really want to do with AI is to be more proactive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1300" target="_blank">00:21:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So now I am in a pull request. I, not me, but Mr. Left Rife left here actually introduced a vulnerability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">In this vulnerability, he, let's see what the vulnerability is, cross-site scripting. So he introduced</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1313" target="_blank">00:21:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">some cross-site scripting, easy mistake to make, very common vulnerability,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1317" target="_blank">00:21:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">usually an easy fix. But as a developer, I never really knew what it was. So I can get a better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1322" target="_blank">00:22:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding of what that is. So dependent, advanced security will actually tell you, hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this is the vulnerability. This is the information around that vulnerability. But the autofix aspect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1331" target="_blank">00:22:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">will actually be very specific. So this specific solution is to this vulnerability. So now before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1337" target="_blank">00:22:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you even merge your code into your production, main branches, develop branches,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1341" target="_blank">00:22:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you can get results and an answer back on how to resolve that vulnerability. So finding that vulnerability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1348" target="_blank">00:22:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and remediating it all within the pull request. And that's the power of AI in this case. So in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1353" target="_blank">00:22:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">example here, it's asking to install the escape HTML library and import that in and actually that resolves</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1359" target="_blank">00:22:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">your vulnerability fairly easily. But it could have saved me like a couple minutes, a couple hours, a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1364" target="_blank">00:22:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">couple days, depending on how much I knew about this pull request or how much I knew about the code or how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1369" target="_blank">00:22:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">much I understood from this vulnerability to actually make that fix. In this case, it took me just reading</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1375" target="_blank">00:22:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">through this. And I want to make sure I obviously I'm still the developer. I still want to do my analysis,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">understand if I if it's the right answer. But I can then decide to commit that fix. And as soon as I commit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1385" target="_blank">00:23:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that fix, it will rerun all the scans. So we can see if that vulnerability is actually remediated right off the bat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1390" target="_blank">00:23:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's our AI autofix. And I know we have only like one more minute left. But at the end of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">day, what we really want to show is how AI can really improve that experience. And this is just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1401" target="_blank">00:23:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">one example. And the more examples are if we're generating some secrets, I can show that at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Microsoft booth if you want to stop by later on. Generating the secrets with AI, detecting other types</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">of secrets with AI. I can show all of that at the Microsoft booth later on. Awesome. Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTqdQpe39A&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We'll see you next time.</span></div></div></body></html>
