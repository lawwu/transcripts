It comes in at 818,000. The economic data that comes out keeps getting re-forecast down, so they put out a provisional number or an estimate, and then when they finalize the number three months or six months later, it always seems to go in one direction.</p><p>We've seen this over and over again with new jobs being re-forecast down, and we saw this with the Q1 GDP. We're in a low-key recession, so I think that we're going to probably go through a couple of very difficult revisions of old data. The thing to remember about non-farm payrolls isn't as much what the number is, but if you actually look to the number of times it then gets revised, the reality is that these things get revised constantly, and right now we're in this trend where we are overestimating and revising down.</p></div></div></body></html>
