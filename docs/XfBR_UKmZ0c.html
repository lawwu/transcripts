days,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">it would have been a record, now

target="_blank">00:02:34.100</a></span> | <span class="t">or even like fancier clothes, like a name brand, an expensive sneaker, whereas you might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">want to pay 75, you're going to

basically, it's a good thing to just lay out ahead of time, these are, these are your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.300</a></span> | <span class="t">needs versus wants, we're going to cover your needs, you're going to save up for your wants</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.420</a></span> | <span class="t">with your allowance, your birthday money, or extra money that you earn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's kind of a debate whether or not to tie allowance to chores.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And a lot of parents say, you know, do you want to tie it to the chores?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Some don't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And I did read several books and listen to some podcasts to prepare for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And what most people, the kind of experts are saying, you know, a good method is a hybrid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">method where the allowance is not tied to basic chores, you have to do your basic chores,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.860</a></span> | <span class="t">keep your room clean, whatever else is assigned, take the garbage out, and so those are expected</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">to be done, you know, that's not tied to the allowance, so you're going to get your allowance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.980</a></span> | <span class="t">either way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But the allowance is kind of a basic amount where you know, we get a few things, but it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.740</a></span> | <span class="t">not overly generous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can allow your child to earn extra money by doing kind of extra seasonal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">chores above and beyond the normal chores, raking leaves, you know, that kind of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's what a lot of people recommend is like a hybrid method.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">But basically, you know, you can choose however you want to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's the debate over whether you should pay the allowance in cash, or some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.860</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of electronic ledger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I remember when my children were little, we started out with cash, but then we had a problem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.500</a></span> | <span class="t">where if I would go to the store and buy him a toy, then they reimburse me for me, we got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.340</a></span> | <span class="t">we got home.</span></div><div

they got reimbursed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And my child was like, Oh, I know I had $30.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Where did it go?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm like, I don't

they bought something, I would subtract or every week when they got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">allowance, I would add so they could go back and see if they couldn't remember, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfBR_UKmZ0c&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">because sometimes you can't remember what all you spent on.</span></div><div
