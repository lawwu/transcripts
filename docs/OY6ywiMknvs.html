All right, so why don't I use complicated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">systems and software? Well, this comes down to friction. Friction is an important concept.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">When we're talking about work, friction describes the extra effort or time or complexity that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">surrounds the actual task you're trying to accomplish. Right? So that's what we mean by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">friction here. In some cases when it comes to work, friction doesn't matter. So I have an example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">This is actually one I go into in detail in my upcoming book, Slow Productivity. It's an example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">about how the New Yorker writer John McPhee works on his articles, his famous long-form articles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">TLDR, there's a lot of friction in his approach.

And then when it comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">time to write a particular section of his book, taking out a piece of plywood, and he starts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">arranging slivers on the plywood in the order that he might want to actually use them so that when he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">finally writes, all that information is written. So that's a ton of overhead. It's a ton of friction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">In this case, it doesn't matter. The primary thing John McPhee is trying to do is think deeply and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">write really well. So friction in this context slows him down in a way that's actually beneficial.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It allows him to organize his thoughts.

He needs to take a long time. Friction is fine. In other cases, however,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">friction can be a real problem. Note-taking, I think, is one of those cases. When information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is coming at you, your time to act, your energy to think, both are probably pretty limited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I have a relatively complicated system I have to boot up and start using markup code to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">take this article I just randomly came across and enter it into my system and cross-reference it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">with the right Zettelkasten categorization system so it will semantically link to other related</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">articles, I'm probably just going to say, "Forget about it."

And that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">information then is lost.

I read a lot of books. Hopefully you read a fair amount of books</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">as well. There is information in books as relevant to your work. There's information in books as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">relevant to your life.

That's important. So how do you take notes on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">books? Well, I'm going to show you my method. I'm going to draw here just so you'll bring up for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">those who are watching.

So I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">putting some like words on here.

And it is as low friction as you can possibly make note taking on books while still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">actually being useful. Here's what I do. If there's something on this page, like the page you see here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that is interesting to me, or I want to remember, first thing I do is I mark the corner like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So just mark a line across the corner. Now I know if I'm flipping through this book that that page</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">has something important on it. What do I then do with the information on this page</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that is actually I want to remember? Simple marks in the margins. Right? So I might, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">put a little box. See here. I might put a little bit of a box around text that's important. Or I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">might just put a little bit of a checkmark next to a line. Or I might put a curly brace next to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a paragraph that I want to remember. Just small marks in the margins to indicate what lines are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">important. Occasionally, I might scribble a little note to myself as well. If there's like a particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that reminds me of. That's it. This barely slows you down as you're going through a book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Mark, mark, mark. I usually keep, you'll see me, I'll have a pencil in my teeth as I'm reading.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll pull it out. Mark, mark, mark. That's all it is. So it barely slows you down. But here's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the reality of the corner marking method. If you go back to that book way later, so it's out of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">your working memories a year later, it's five years later.

So it's a very effective way of capturing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that information. It's not in some fancy system where it'll automatically like show you all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">quotes, but you get to them almost as fast. It takes a little bit longer to go through the book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but the information is there. So the low friction here is important because it doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">prevent you from reading. In other words, if the effort required to read, you're just there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">in terms of what you have available.

All right. So that's the part one. Part two, projects. Now, typically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">what I'm thinking here is professional projects, but we'll see this can apply to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">personal projects as well.

I write articles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">for popular press, like magazines.

Where is my magic system that I put it? My approach is to store notes relevant to projects</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in the location where you will one day work on that project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, I write my popular press articles using Scrivener.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I have an idea for an article, I'll create a Scrivener document for it.

It's stupid. But I love it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">because I have like 15 different digital notebooks in there now, and I could just go to any of them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">at any time.

To me, it's interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That's where you have your cool notebook for keeping track of ideas about your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=1072" target="_blank">00:17:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And all you need there is some sort of semi-regular process of reading through these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">The very simplest thing you can do if you're using a physical notebook</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is when you fill it, put aside an hour to review it, and to only copy into your new notebook,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=1089" target="_blank">00:18:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">short summaries of the most important or lasting ideas from your previous notebook.

It is low friction. It is simple. Very little custom software is required.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">One cool notebook and whatever else you're already using for your work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But because you're adding very little friction, you can keep up. And the stuff that matters will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">get captured and put to the place where it matters.

When it comes to your projects, having your notes where you want to actually do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=1141" target="_blank">00:19:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the work is not just efficient, but it allows you to re-encounter the gestalt of what you know about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that project again and again as you grow those notes, allowing your mind to work more with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=1151" target="_blank">00:19:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And cool notebooks put you into that mindset of a cultivator or crafter of your own life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=1158" target="_blank">00:19:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're sort of hacking the brain here.

So that's my system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not as exciting as other systems. Some other systems, people actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">make this clear disclaimer, like building systems. And that's fine. I mean, if that's like your hobby,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's fine. If you like building the complicated system because you get enjoyment in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=1185" target="_blank">00:19:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the system, you might actually take more notes because you really love the use this cool system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you built.

You do not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=1200" target="_blank">00:20:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">need a super complicated system, but you do need something.

If you haven't heard me talk about it before, Cozy Earth, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=1278" target="_blank">00:21:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">describe themselves as life-changing luxury.

However, there are still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=3674" target="_blank">01:01:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">ideas I have about my life or my business that aren't tied yet to a specific project,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=3680" target="_blank">01:01:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like something I'm writing where I can put it.

It's just now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=3685" target="_blank">01:01:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">they're all within my remarkable. So if I had it with me, I'd see there's a bunch in there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=3691" target="_blank">01:01:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">but it was like working on ideas for the media business, like the podcast and like video.

So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=3704" target="_blank">01:01:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I still have idea notebooks for what can't be captured in an existing work tool. So it's less</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=3711" target="_blank">01:01:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">than I had before. In terms of reviewing those, I review them when I need to. So if I'm thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=3717" target="_blank">01:01:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to figure out a plan, a new quarter is coming up.

I'll go back and look at that notebook then. I have another notebook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=3728" target="_blank">01:02:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like let's say this is not one I have, but let's just say you're really interested in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=3731" target="_blank">01:02:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">owning a cabin.

And that might be a notebook you really don't look at. You're just putting stuff in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=3745" target="_blank">01:02:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">there until like years later, some sort of opportunity comes up.

So I put those two pieces of my answer together. One, if you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=3762" target="_blank">01:02:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">ideas or information relevant to specific work projects or processes where there's like an actual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=3767" target="_blank">01:02:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">tool you will eventually use to act on that idea stored in that tool, everything else you can use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=3772" target="_blank">01:02:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">idea notebooks for, you can use moleskins, you can use field notes. They're smaller. If you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=3776" target="_blank">01:02:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of them and less ideas, you can use a remarkable, if you want to do it digitally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=3780" target="_blank">01:03:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And when it comes to reviewing them, review them when you need to review them.

And Seneca, for various reasons, just didn't really act on it or talk out about it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY6ywiMknvs&t=4461" target="_blank">01:14:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">at least not until it was sort of too late.
