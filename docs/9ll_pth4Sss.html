I asked a lot of people to tell me what they thought about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the details of the dates and I found that they were more interested in the details than Google.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And my conclusion from this is don't trust either of them on dates.

But now back to a loss for Bard which is in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.100</a></span> | <span class="t">grammar and writing assistance. I gave it a classic GMAT sentence correction question where essentially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.260</a></span> | <span class="t">you have to pick the version that sounds the best.

Bing gets this right almost every time picking B which is well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">written. Whereas Bard as you can see even if you look at the other drafts gets it wrong more times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.140</a></span> | <span class="t">than it gets it right.

These are the classic cases that both</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Microsoft and Google are advertising that their services can do and to be honest this was not a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.100</a></span> | <span class="t">one-off win for Bing. Let me show you the next example. This was a challenge to compose a sonnet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.100</a></span> | <span class="t">based on a subject and by this point in my experimentation I kind of expected the result</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.140</a></span> | <span class="t">that I got. When I asked both Bard and Bing to write me a sonnet about modern London life,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Bard gave me an answer that was quite dry, anodyne and didn't always rhyme. Even setting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.100</a></span> | <span class="t">aside those flaws it was just bland. There was no sharpness or social commentary. Notice I said about modern London life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Not only was Bing's answer much more like a true sonnet there was even social commentary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Take a look at the second stanza but underneath the surface there are cracks.

Now for millions or maybe even billions of people who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">just want a quick output Bard will be fine and let's be honest we all know that there are social</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.180</a></span> | <span class="t">and ethical concerns with both models.

What</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.900</a></span> | <span class="t">about this kind of riddle? This sentence contains exactly three errors. They both understand that the third error is the same error.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The sentence contains three errors because it only contains two. Okay fine I would have to try harder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So then I tried this one. I tried to steal spaghetti from the shop but the female guard saw me and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.100</a></span> | <span class="t">couldn't get pasta. Somewhat annoyingly they both understood that joke. What about "did you know if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.260</a></span> | <span class="t">you get pregnant in the Amazon it's next day delivery?" I honestly thought they might shy away from this one because it touched on a rival company but no they both explained it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But then I finally found one. It was this one. "By my age my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.380</a></span> | <span class="t">parents had a house and a family and to be fair to me so do I but it's the same house and it's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">same family." Bard thinks that I'm not joking and actually almost calls social services. It says</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">"people are different, times have changed, I understand you're frustrated." It's very sympathetic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but it didn't get that I was telling a joke and that's kind of despite the fact that I just told</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">about five other jokes.

Bing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">realized that it was being tested which was a truly impressive feat.

It did attempt to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">predict whether I thought it had theory of mind but it didn't get the deeper point that the question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ll_pth4Sss&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">itself was testing for theory of mind.
