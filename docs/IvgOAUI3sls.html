So I want to talk to you today about this general</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">strategy of seasonality. I'm going to argue that it's important for basically everyone, especially if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you have some sort of knowledge or office work job, you might not be able to push your summer schedule</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.220</a></span> | <span class="t">to the same extreme as mine, but I think it should be different.

And then I'll give you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.880</a></span> | <span class="t">some ideas about how you can do that. Even if you have less flexibility than myself. All right, let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">start with the case for the seasonality, taking one season to be different and less intense than other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.500</a></span> | <span class="t">seasons.

I wrote about this idea, did some good research on this. So I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.020</a></span> | <span class="t">to take a second to take advantage of the research I already did.

All right. So I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">arguing here. I, I, so I, I do a, before this, I went through a treatment of what the foraging and hunting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and gathering life was like in which we spent most of our species existence. Drawing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">on some more recent research from the Agta people in the Philippines, where you have the same people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that divided half of the group, went to rice farming and the other half stayed with foraging. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting research from the 2000s where they compared the lifestyle between these two groups. They were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">otherwise very much controlled to be the same people in the same type of geographical region. And they found that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, the, the hunting and gathering foraging group has way more variation in their days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Busy periods, non-busy periods, busy seasons, non-busy periods.

But if you're effectively just, if I spend five hours versus 10, I'm going to get half as much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=2909" target="_blank">00:48:29.220</a></span> | <span class="t">money is not where you want to be in a side hustle.

Um, two, I would say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=2915" target="_blank">00:48:35.940</a></span> | <span class="t">care about your existing career capital.

Finally, there's an idea from Derek Sivers that I featured in my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=2980" target="_blank">00:49:40.900</a></span> | <span class="t">book so good. They can't ignore you when evaluating your current side hustle and whether you want,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=2986" target="_blank">00:49:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">if it's successful or not successful, or whether you want it to become more of a full-time thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=2989" target="_blank">00:49:49.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm quoting them here, use money as a neutral indicator of value.

Are people paying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=2997" target="_blank">00:49:57.860</a></span> | <span class="t">me for this?

So Derek Sivers had this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3017" target="_blank">00:50:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">idea with the side hustles that he transformed in the full-time roles on multiple occasions throughout</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3022" target="_blank">00:50:22.820</a></span> | <span class="t">his interesting career is that he would use money as a neutral indicator of value. If this is generating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3027" target="_blank">00:50:27.380</a></span> | <span class="t">money, it's valuable. If it's not, it's not. Should I make this my full-time job? Well, here's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3031" target="_blank">00:50:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">question. Is it generating enough money to be my full-time job? That seems like it's really simple,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3035" target="_blank">00:50:35.980</a></span> | <span class="t">but people often ignore that. They want to sort of assign other sources of value to their idea. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3040" target="_blank">00:50:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">well, it's really cool.

It's not really a reliable indicator of value. Get people to give you money. And if they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3050" target="_blank">00:50:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">not, the idea is not that successful.

I enjoyed your recent podcast, looking at how to become a straight A student as I am a college</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3074" target="_blank">00:51:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">student. And that was my initial introduction to you. My question is, you talked for a second that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3081" target="_blank">00:51:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">if you were going to rewrite that, that you would have a section on focus. And I know that you said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3087" target="_blank">00:51:27.700</a></span> | <span class="t">that you'd probably never rewrite it, but I was curious what principles you would go over in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3092" target="_blank">00:51:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">section like that. That's something that I really struggle with and I'm trying to figure out how to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3097" target="_blank">00:51:37.700</a></span> | <span class="t">implement that as a college student. So my basic framework about focus is in the book and when it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3106" target="_blank">00:51:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">changed. So there's a core idea in that book, how to become a straight A student from 2006. It's an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3111" target="_blank">00:51:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">equation that says work accomplished equals total hours spent times intensity of focus. And my point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3121" target="_blank">00:52:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">there, like why I made that argument was one of the easiest ways or most effective ways to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3127" target="_blank">00:52:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">more work done is to not just increase the hours piece of that equation, but to increase the focused</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3134" target="_blank">00:52:14.100</a></span> | <span class="t">piece of that equation. They're multiplied by each other.

And back then I was saying what I saw is too many people would study in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3145" target="_blank">00:52:25.300</a></span> | <span class="t">a low intensity of focus. So sort of at the library with their friends and reading instead of doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3150" target="_blank">00:52:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">more difficult, like passive consumption instead of active recall. And they would just try to increase</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3154" target="_blank">00:52:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the hours component to get the amount of work that needed to be accomplished done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3157" target="_blank">00:52:37.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's a hard game. Like you got to spend long amounts of time doing that work. And I would say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3162" target="_blank">00:52:42.460</a></span> | <span class="t">no, no, increase that intensity of focus. Come at this thing with laser light focus and you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3166" target="_blank">00:52:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">drastically reduce the hours needed to get the work done. And that's actually more sustainable in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3170" target="_blank">00:52:50.200</a></span> | <span class="t">long run because you're not spending all your time studying. That central equation still stands.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3174" target="_blank">00:52:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">What's different is the obstacles to intensity of focus today versus 20 years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3181" target="_blank">00:53:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You have way worse obstacles in particular in your hand, in that phone that's next to you while you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3188" target="_blank">00:53:08.900</a></span> | <span class="t">study. That is a much bigger obstacle than we had to deal with in 2006. I was worried about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3195" target="_blank">00:53:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">conversations with people at the same table.

So using study techniques that weren't very mentally taxing. Therefore, they didn't require</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3204" target="_blank">00:53:24.060</a></span> | <span class="t">much focus, but required a lot more time.

Like that's the type of stuff I worried about. So you have obstacles to boosting that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3215" target="_blank">00:53:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">intensity of focus now that are way more accessible and appealing and disastrous than what we were facing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=3221" target="_blank">00:53:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">back in, in 2026.

Well, look at how much better this model was in that model. If we just do that five</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4011" target="_blank">01:06:51.500</a></span> | <span class="t">more times, it's the danger of exponentials, the seduction of exponentials. We do that type of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4015" target="_blank">01:06:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">doubling inability five more times and like all work will be done this way.

So where is all the energy shifted? Because they still need to make improvements, right? You've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4024" target="_blank">01:07:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">noticed OpenAI has now released all these models that have weird names. It's GPT-4-0 and GT-4-0-3 and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4032" target="_blank">01:07:12.820</a></span> | <span class="t">all these different types of weird names. Well, they're having to put their energy into much more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4037" target="_blank">01:07:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">narrow development. So a lot of what's happening now is they'll take what they call a foundational</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4041" target="_blank">01:07:21.340</a></span> | <span class="t">model, which will just be an existing model like GPT-4.

So that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4142" target="_blank">01:09:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">what's really going on now.

GPT-4 is kind of like their state-of-the-art base</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4199" target="_blank">01:09:59.880</a></span> | <span class="t">model. If you're looking at open AI and they're looking for specific applications where you can get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4204" target="_blank">01:10:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">good data sets for reinforcement learning on particular tasks. Now this is producing and will produce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4209" target="_blank">01:10:09.140</a></span> | <span class="t">cool bespoke tools. It's going to be a long product development cycle. You got to figure out places</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4214" target="_blank">01:10:14.020</a></span> | <span class="t">where you can build these type of tuned models and then build good software agents around them and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4217" target="_blank">01:10:17.860</a></span> | <span class="t">integrate them into the workflows where people use them. But it's a far cry from the vision that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4222" target="_blank">01:10:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">people had two years ago of like, no, no, just GPT-6 will be anything you ask it. It'll do at a human</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4228" target="_blank">01:10:28.780</a></span> | <span class="t">level. In fact, it can write its own code to make agents around it and we won't even have to like work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4233" target="_blank">01:10:33.820</a></span> | <span class="t">anymore. That is not the trajectory we're on at the moment anymore. Without the scaling laws,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4238" target="_blank">01:10:38.300</a></span> | <span class="t">we have to sort of hand build bespoke models that can do specific tasks where we happen to have data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4243" target="_blank">01:10:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">for it. There's many things that we do in our lives where there's not going to be good data sets for,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4247" target="_blank">01:10:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but where there are, I think they're going to eventually have really cool tools. This is a cool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4251" target="_blank">01:10:51.500</a></span> | <span class="t">technology, but it is not on one of these, I have to write an article about the end of business</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4258" target="_blank">01:10:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">type of trajectories. So anyways, this is like a really important thing that's going on. This is being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4262" target="_blank">01:11:02.760</a></span> | <span class="t">discussed a lot among like the high executives in these companies, the death of the scaling laws,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4267" target="_blank">01:11:07.460</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to build out these bespoke skills. I mean, so I'll just say real briefly. So why then did we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4274" target="_blank">01:11:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">have like the AI 2027 report come out last month saying, no, by 2027, these AIs are going to be in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4282" target="_blank">01:11:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">charge of everything. And by 2030, humanity might be dead. Well, I look closer at like what was really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4288" target="_blank">01:11:28.420</a></span> | <span class="t">going on there because they know the scaling laws aren't working, right? So what's their tech story for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4294" target="_blank">01:11:34.220</a></span> | <span class="t">for how AI is going to kill humanity in the next like three years, right? If you look closer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4299" target="_blank">01:11:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it all comes down to a single assumption, which I think is specious. The tuning we're doing for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4304" target="_blank">01:11:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">producing computer programs is getting better, which is true like that. We have good data sets for that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4309" target="_blank">01:11:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and computer programs are text and we can produce a reasonable size, good computer code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4315" target="_blank">01:11:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the foundational assumption of AI 2027 is, well, we're better at computer programming with models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4321" target="_blank">01:12:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">now than we were before. So maybe if we keep getting better at that in the next year or so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4326" target="_blank">01:12:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">the models will just be able to build their own. They'll solve the problem of how to build a more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4330" target="_blank">01:12:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">technically advanced AI. Yeah, we can't just scale language models. We don't know the tech story for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4334" target="_blank">01:12:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">what type of models would be super powerful or super intelligent, but maybe if we just make them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4338" target="_blank">01:12:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">better at programming, they'll figure it out in the year 2026 and then we'll be in trouble.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4342" target="_blank">01:12:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a crazy assumption. Anyone who's actually working with the tuning of language models to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4347" target="_blank">01:12:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">produce computer code to think like, yeah, that's going to lead to giant breakthroughs and architectures</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4353" target="_blank">01:12:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">for artificial intelligence. It's a, it's a crazy claim. It's like saying the Wright brothers being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4361" target="_blank">01:12:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">like, we've, we just found the new type of propeller and now we can, we can get powered flight. Now it used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4368" target="_blank">01:12:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to just be for a little bit on Kitty Hawk beach. Now we can actually go up and circle the field and come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4371" target="_blank">01:12:51.880</a></span> | <span class="t">down and do like 10 minute flights. So like, I don't think we're that far away from interstellar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4376" target="_blank">01:12:56.220</a></span> | <span class="t">travel. It's like different. I mean, they're both flying, but it was like completely different levels</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4381" target="_blank">01:13:01.900</a></span> | <span class="t">of complexity and challenges. So anyways, this is an important story. I, you know, I'm, I'm increasingly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4388" target="_blank">01:13:08.260</a></span> | <span class="t">believing there's this like weird temperature raising on AI that is becoming more disassociated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4393" target="_blank">01:13:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">from the tech story. And so not to talk about AI too much, but this I think is an important story</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4398" target="_blank">01:13:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding that the scaling laws seem to be faltering for language models puts us into a much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4404" target="_blank">01:13:24.100</a></span> | <span class="t">more traditional business innovation cycle landscape for, for AI tools right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4409" target="_blank">01:13:29.160</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, there we go. I'm writing a massive, actually it might be out by the time this, this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4413" target="_blank">01:13:33.900</a></span> | <span class="t">comes out on my newsletter.

So check that out at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4422" target="_blank">01:13:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">newport.com. It should be live when you hear this podcast episode. Nice. I've just been deep on this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4427" target="_blank">01:13:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">in a while. I was like, I don't want to keep talking about all the time. Let me just put down like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4430" target="_blank">01:13:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, here's what I think is going on. And it's an article, at least in the draft that is now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4433" target="_blank">01:13:53.620</a></span> | <span class="t">here's the places where like AI is really affecting the world of work. Here's the places where I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4438" target="_blank">01:13:58.260</a></span> | <span class="t">it will soon. It hasn't been developed yet, but we'll soon here's some places where it's like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4442" target="_blank">01:14:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">little more hazy, like how exactly is it going to play out, but there could be some cool stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4445" target="_blank">01:14:05.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's the stuff that's crazy town. I try to cite a lot of things and make the tech story a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4450" target="_blank">01:14:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">clear. So look for that article, calendlyport.com. It should be up. All right. Speaking of which,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4456" target="_blank">01:14:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I should probably go work some more on that. So let's call this episode to a close. Thank you all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgOAUI3sls&t=4460" target="_blank">01:14:20.540</a></span> | <span class="t">for listening back next week with another episode.
