So do I have that right? Where did you first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=28" target="_blank">00:00:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">begin this second part of your life? Yeah. So in my first year of med school,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">in high school I coasted because I was naturally smart and I could just get good grades by default.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=41" target="_blank">00:00:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I got to med school and then it was like I was hit in the face with a baseball bat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">because now all of a sudden everyone around me was really smart and I was totally mediocre.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, "Oh my goodness, this is a new experience." And my first year of med school was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.200</a></span> | <span class="t">like pretty overwhelming and pretty like draining. And I was doing a lot of the hard work in inverted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">commas, the grind, all that stuff. And then randomly in my second year, we had a lecture</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in experimental psychology around effective study techniques or effective memory and learning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">techniques. And that was where I first heard the phrase active recall and spaced repetition and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff. And my mind was fricking blown. I was like, "How the hell have I never in my life come across</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this stuff before? Like what?" And then I was like, "I need to research more about this stuff."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I came across your blog and I came across your books and I came across Lifehacker and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">started doing a bunch of digging into the studies around active recall and stuff. And then I started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">applying those to my life as a student. And then in my second year I did super well. I got a first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">class in my exams. It felt like euphoric. Then in my third year, that was when I was studying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">psychology as like an extra degree type thing. I was thinking, "Hmm, you know what? Now that I know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">all these effective study techniques and I know how to be productive as it comes to being a student,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">let me try and go for rank one." Because I was like, "This is the best time. I'm going to try</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and go for top of the year." And I applied all the techniques.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">What is rank one? For the American listeners, that's how elite in the class ranking is rank one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, that's like the top.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it number one? Is that the same as being like number one?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Number one, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, wow. Okay. So you're going for number one in your class?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, rank one, number one. Yeah, number one in the class. It was a year where I was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">"I'm studying psychology. This is a super interesting subject. I know all these study</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">techniques. Let's just go for it. Let's try and play this game." And so I applied all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">productivity techniques and the stuff from your blog and the stuff from all of these things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">started giving talks about them, and ended up winning joint first prize for top of the class</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that year. I was like, "It worked." So that's kind of what started this interest in productivity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like literally having a before and after of I didn't know any of this stuff, and then I applied</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it. And then I did really well and had a way better time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It's funny how the parallels here. I mean, you know this, we've talked about this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">but this was exactly my introduction to college for me, not med school. First year went okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">got serious about techniques, began crushing it. I didn't get smarter over the summer between those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">two years. So there was this urgency of I got to tell other people about this. This was crazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't get number one in my class at my college, but I was top 30 out of a thousand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">That first year held me back. But it sounds like you had a similar urgency of why don't more people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">know about this? This made a big difference, just being intentional and careful and evidence-based</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">about how you approach work, at least in the academic setting. It was like a low-hanging</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">fruit. And of course, that blogging world you talked about, what a wonderful time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But it was the air of that blog. You couldn't really monetize those blogs. It wasn't like it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is today where you could gain real notoriety. People just were interested in things and wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to help each other. So you're okay. So now you're coming out of your studies with this same sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">insight I had as well, that at least in the world of studies and studying, technique matters, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it could matter a huge amount. So you have that bug. How does that bug then grow? I assume after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this, you're going into the early stages of training. In the US, this would be like the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">internship year followed by residency. It's probably different terminology in the UK.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But as you enter in the maelstrom of formal medical training, clinical training,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">what happens to this bug, this interest? Yeah. So this interest in study techniques</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">then morphs into an interest in time management and productivity generally. Because around when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I started my second year of med school, I also started a business on the side that was helping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">other people get into med school in the UK. So I was running courses and stuff on the weekends,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">going up to random conference rooms and running seminars in the olden days, printing out these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">little booklets and things. And so I was starting a business from scratch. And that obviously takes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">time and energy. And so I was spending a lot of time reading your blog, reading your stuff,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">reading Lifehacker, following everything Tim Ferriss has ever written. Anyone who's vaguely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in the world of productivity, I was reading and trying to apply things like 80/20 and batching,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and all this stuff that your listeners will be aware of. But to me at the time was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">oh my goodness, you're saying if I batch my emails all in one hour, I can reply to all these customer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">service things? That's cool. Why did no one tell me this before? And so as I'm discovering all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">productivity techniques, I'm applying them to my life while I'm building the business on the side</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">while being in med school. And that continues for a while. I give a few talks about how to study for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">exams because I'm like, more people need to hear about this stuff. And then in 2017, this was in my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">penultimate year of med school, I decided, you know what, you know, I'd been running the business</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for a few years at that point. And we were sort of plateauing. So I thought, I think I should start a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">YouTube channel. And I think I should make videos that teach people how to get into med school,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">because then maybe if they think I'm legit, they'll sign up to my paid courses or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I now know that this is called organic content marketing, but I didn't have that terminology back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">in the day. And I started making those videos, people started liking them. And very quickly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">students started asking me, how do you study for your exams? You're a Cambridge medical student.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, Oh, funny, you should ask. I've been doing this shit for four years now. And I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">been giving talks about it. So let's just make some videos about it. And my first video that went</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">viral was a video called how to study for exams, where I talked about active recall, I talked about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">some of the studies, some of the kind of literature reviews and systematic reviews that have been done</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that show that active recall and spaced repetition and stuff is the way to go. And that video went</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">viral. And that was like the, you know, that was the start of my YouTube channel really taking off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so where were you on the medical side of things? 2017 ish? Where are you in your training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">at this point? Yeah, so at this point, the way it works in the UK is you have three years of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">pre clinical, like medical school, kind of like pre med, like lots of basic physiology,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">anatomy, biochemistry, blah, blah, blah. And then you have another three years of clinical school,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which is where you're still technically a student, but you're not going into the hospital and like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">seeing patients and stuff. So I was in my second of the three clinical years. So I had one more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">year of clinical school left when I started the YouTube channel. I see. So in the American system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you actually go to university for met for being a doctor. So like those first three years would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">be like being a pre med major at an American university. And then the clinical years are like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the US equivalent of being at what we would call medical school. Is that? Yeah, exactly. So it's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">bit more compressed in the UK, like it's six years for the whole thing, whereas in the UK in the US,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it's four years and then four years and then residency. So it sounds like in that period</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">leading up to this, you were running the business on the side that was actually one of your focuses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in terms of applying productivity advice in your own life, which makes sense, given the tenor of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the sort of Tim Ferriss age of productivity was very sort of side hustle focused. And how do you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">take a business and push into a smaller portion of your of your life? And so was any of the energy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and ideas that were coming out of this productivity literature that you're applying to your business,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">were you also applying this still to what was going on academically? Or did this feel</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">different? Like, was there a break between the active recall? How do we study? Well, stuff. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the Tim Ferriss life hacker, like, how do you run a business stuff? Or did you see this all as sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">of package? Yes. So one thing that you have wrote about in the blog, I don't I don't know when I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">discovered this, but you have a blog post that's something to the effect of when for trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">figure out what to do with your career, don't start with a degree and then figure out therefore,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">what job do I want to go into? You say something like figure out what life you want, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=515" target="_blank">00:08:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">reverse engineer what job you want based on that. And so I don't know when I read this, but I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=519" target="_blank">00:08:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">like, this is this is useful advice. And I realized the life I wanted, I was a life where I worked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">part time as a doctor, because I had spoken to so many doctors, they all hated their lives,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">except the ones who work part time, the ones who work two or three days a week having a great time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">they love it. I was like, Okay, how do I reverse engineer part time medicine from this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So beginning with the end in mind, recognizing part time medicine, I was like, okay, cool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I now need to devote time and energy to building sources of passive income so that I can afford to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">work part time. Yep. And secondly, I kind of realized that playing the academic game, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I got I got the number one position in my third year, I was like, do I want to keep working for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that number one position? Like, is it worth it? Yeah, is it worth it? Given that I'm not trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to be a fancy professor or anything, I'm literally trying to work part time so I can like have a chill</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">life, probably not worth it. So what's the minimum amount of studying I need to do to comfortably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">pass the exams without like going overboard? Because unless you, for example, get a distinction,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">which is how it works in the UK, which, you know, I knew, I knew it would have taken a lot of work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and not actually translate to the lifestyle that I wanted. So thank you for that advice. But what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that meant was a quick interruption. If you want my free guide with my seven best ideas on how to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">cultivate the deep life, go to Cal Newport dot com slash ideas, or click the link right below</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in the description. This is a great way to take action on the type of things we talk about here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">on the show. All right, let's get back to it. I was like going kind of doing the bare minimum of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like, how do I kind of only study for like half an hour a day so that I can edit videos for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">other seven hours of the day. So I'd be going into hospital with my laptop, I'd be seeing I'd be very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">targeted. And like, I think like a lot of medical students have a scattergun approach to clinical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff. You like go in and you shadow the doctors and you get an exposure and like, get a feel of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what's going on in the hospitals. I was like, No, screw that. That's so inefficient. What a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">poor use of time. Yeah, let me identify exactly what my learning outcome is. Find the specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">patient that I want to talk to based on talking to doctors be like, I need a patient who has this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of murmur, go and talk to them do the thing. I'm done in 20 minutes. Now I can sit in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">common room and edit my video for the next six hours. I was doing that kind of hustle while I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">was in my final year of med school. So you were Tim Ferrissine, medical school, like figured out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, hey, what actually matters here? Let me get rid of the wasted effort. Let me do let me deal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">let me eliminate and, and automate. It's fascinating. So in the years before that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going all out. But that kind of makes sense, right? Because that helps you get placed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">into the better clinical training, I'm assuming. I mean, I know, for example, you probably were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">doing some peer review publication during your extra psych year, like you were doing the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that you do to stand out. But I guess this like in the US, once you got into a good medical school,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">if your plan was like you're talking about maybe to be like an emergency department doctor that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">does swing shifts three days a week, it doesn't really matter that you're the number one student</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in your med school. Once you're there. Let's start Tim Ferrissine. This has fascinating. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And did you, and from that blog post of yours that said, figure out what life you want in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">reverse engineering. I was like, mind blown. So I think I remember exactly when I wrote that. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The piece of career advice no one gives you, I think it was titled something like that. I was at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">a graduation. I remember that. I remember that post well, as because I was getting towards the end of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">grad school and starting to think about why didn't I actually work backwards. Also, Tim was a big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">influence. So we're all just, we're all just stealing from, we're stealing from Tim.

What was YouTube like? 2017, you start doing these videos. This is early</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">YouTube. This is what I'm thinking of learning videos in 2017, how to study. I'm thinking maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">like Thomas Frank, like, I don't know who's around at this point, but what is YouTube in 2017? What's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the landscape you were surveying as you, as you began to grow that part of your life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So YouTube 2017 was, yeah, Thomas Frank was the only real voice in productivity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And there were a couple of medical people doing content about like what medical school is like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">but a lot of them were in the US and there wasn't anyone doing it very well in the UK.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I thought, hmm, this is interesting. Yeah. This was what Casey Neistat was doing his daily,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">daily vlogs-ish. Peter McKinnon had just started making YouTube videos about photography and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">videography. And Peter McKinnon was a big inspiration because he was teaching photo and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">video, but in a engaging and dynamic way. There was a guy called Simon Clark who had a hundred</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">thousand subscribers. He was like the first vlogger in the UK in the student scene. And he was an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Oxford PhD physics student. And that kind of helped me realize, wait a minute, you don't need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to be a gregarious personality. Simon Clark is a fricking nerd. He's talking about his degree and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">his weather calculations and the fact that he goes to choir on the weekends. I was like, great. He's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">got a hundred thousand subscribers. Wow. There is room on YouTube for a sort of normal person</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">without a very outgoing personality to talk about the subject that they're passionate about, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">for me was like helping people get into med school. And so I thought, you know what, let's just start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">making videos. And I had a bit of a, I think I went into YouTube with five years of experience of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">running my courses business and another 10 years of trying to make money on the internet with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">websites and affiliate marketing and stuff. So I approached YouTube from a business perspective</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">rather than as a, I want to be a creator. The word creator wasn't really a thing in 2017.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And so I thought, you know, even if my videos only get like a couple of hundred views,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">those are a couple of hundred views from students who are trying to get into Cambridge Medical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">School. That is a valuable audience because I can help them out because I know my stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And some of them bought my course. And so I had a bit of a monetization engine built in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">even though I had like no subscribers and no views. And slowly over time, it took me 52 videos</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and six months to get my first thousand subscribers, then another six months to get monetized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And like my 91st video or whatever it was, was that video about how to study for exams,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">where I just repurposed a talk that I gave, added loads of like studies and stuff to it. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that went super viral. And suddenly people around the university were like, "Oh my God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">like I watched your half an hour video about how to study for exams and that's changed my life."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm like, "Nice, this is working." Interesting. Interesting. So it was your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">91st or 92nd video that you really started talking, not just medical school. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">do you think that took off in part because you were more practiced or in part because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of the wider niche that you're now addressing? The medical school was very specific. Getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to the medical school in the UK. Or is it some combination of the two? You knew what you were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">doing and then you hit a niche that had a big enough audience to support real virality and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">those two came together. I haven't thought of this in a while. So this is like a good line of...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it's all like connecting now that I connected those looking backwards. So when I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">started my YouTube channel, again, I applied the Tim Ferriss, Cal Newport approach to productivity to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the YouTube channel as well. Because I was like, I know that this has potential. And so I therefore</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">absorbed a lot of YouTube advice on how to grow on YouTube. And a piece of advice I came across was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you actually don't want your first video to go viral. You want your 100th video to go viral,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">because if that's the video that goes viral, now there's this whole back catalog of content that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">people can binge. Whereas if your first video goes viral, who cares? You're just getting views</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for no reason. And at the time, I knew nothing about making videos, nothing about editing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And another principle from the productivity world is just do a thing 100 times and you'll get good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">at doing the thing. So I was like, "All right, let's apply these together. Let me make 100</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">videos and not think too hard about it. Let's lower the bar. Let's not be perfectionistic about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it. Let's try and get a little bit better each time. Let's watch tutorials on the side to see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">how I can level up my editing and make sure I improve the way I talk on camera and all that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff." And I knew in the back of my mind, when I started YouTube, at some point, I want to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this video about how to study for exams, because I think that video could be a banger. But I knew</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I did not want it to be my first video. I was actually aiming for that to be like my 100th</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">video. Because I thought, "You know what? In 100 videos, I will learn enough about how to make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">videos in order to do justice to that one." And so in a way, I did have a sense of market demand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">here. Because in 2015, randomly, this was a year into my discovering study techniques and your blog</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and everything, I randomly decided to do a talk for the local Islamic society at my university</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">on how to study for exams. And so we booked the local prayer room, which holds like 20 people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And we booked it and made a Facebook event on "Ali Abdaal Teaches You How to Study for Exams"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">with science-backed techniques. And that Facebook event page went viral around the university.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And like 20,000 people saw this Facebook event page, which was meant to be for like a handful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of people in the Islamic society prayer room, for God's sake. And like 1000s of people clicked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">attending on this event. I was like, "Whoa." And then the Islamic society events guy was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1079" target="_blank">00:17:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">"Bloody hell, we need to book a lecture theater and everything." And we ended up me giving a talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in a lecture theater with like a couple 100 other students like hanging on to my every word,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">because they were like, "Oh my God, no one teaches us how to study for exams."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So I had a sense of like, at some point I want to make this YouTube video,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">but it has to be video 100 and not video number one. So I was sort of like trying to get better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">at the craft. And it just sort of worked like around that time when I made that video. I also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1102" target="_blank">00:18:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">did a collab with a bigger YouTuber that put attention on my channel. And the video itself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1106" target="_blank">00:18:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">was very good. I spent ages working on it and had so much research behind it. I think the perfect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">storm of variables hit at the right time for that video to go viral. - Oh, interesting. And what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">makes a video like this good?

Like this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">technique, here's the study, here's what's happening. I mean, these are the different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">elements that came together. So then it just flows when you see it. It's convincing, it's useful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it's interesting. You had all those things coming together. - Absolutely. I think nowadays it would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">be hard to make that same video because six years ago there was a lot less of this sort of content</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1148" target="_blank">00:19:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">on YouTube. So there was also a sense of like, no one has heard this stuff before. But now there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">loads of student YouTube channels. And so talking about active recall or spaced repetition or Anki</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1158" target="_blank">00:19:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or whatever is no longer as novel as it felt at the time. So there was also that sense of like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this is new. Like no one's talking about this stuff. - Right. It's like when I published How</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to Become a Straight A Student, people weren't writing books, believe it or not, on just straight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">up study techniques. So I was like, I will do that. And the book has sold hundreds of thousands</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of copies because no one was doing that. Now it's not so rare. Like, yeah, let's talk about like how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to actually study. But back then, there's something about being new. All right, so then if we jump</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1184" target="_blank">00:19:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">ahead, how far did you get? Where were you in your medical career when that key decision came?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Which we've talked about in depth on your show. That key scary decision of I am leaving medicine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1197" target="_blank">00:19:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to do YouTube full time or my business is full time. How far along were you when that happened?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1202" target="_blank">00:20:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">- So it did kind of happen a little accidentally. Sorry, there's a crying child in the background</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">right now. I don't know if you can hear that. - Yeah, that's life. That's life right there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">- That's life, yeah. It's not my child, it's a friend's child for the record.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It happened kind of accidentally. So in the UK, the way it works is you do two years of working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1219" target="_blank">00:20:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess those are sort of the equivalent of your intern years that we call them the foundation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">years. So you work clinically for two years once you're fully qualified. And then at that point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1228" target="_blank">00:20:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you decide what residency program do I want to apply to? Whether it's medicine or surgery,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">neurosurgery or emergency medicine or anesthetics or whatever. And so there's a natural career break</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1237" target="_blank">00:20:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">after those two years. And what a lot of people will do is take a gap year to, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1242" target="_blank">00:20:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">go to Australia to do emergency medicine. So that was my plan. My plan was in 2020,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1246" target="_blank">00:20:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">once I've done my two years, once I've done my time, I'm going to go to Australia for a year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1250" target="_blank">00:20:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to do emergency medicine as a way of boosting my CV so that when I apply to emergency medicine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1255" target="_blank">00:20:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">residency, I'll have more points and plus Australia's cool, plus why not? But August 2020</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1260" target="_blank">00:21:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">was, you know, Australia closed their borders, pandemic takes over the world. And so I accidentally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">ended up becoming a full-time YouTuber where I'm like, you know, one day I'm at work assisting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">with C-sections because I was an obs and gyne, wearing the whole like hazmat suit because it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">was COVID times. And the next day I'm like, right, I'm stuck at home with nothing to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1278" target="_blank">00:21:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">other than to make YouTube videos. - But in August 2020 was the idea,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1282" target="_blank">00:21:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">ah, my trip to Australia got canceled. Now I have this year off, I'll YouTube,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1288" target="_blank">00:21:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but after this year, I'm going to still go into the residency match. And, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">was that the idea? Okay. So you had this- - That was the idea. So I was planning to apply</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1296" target="_blank">00:21:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for a residency thing in November because it was like the applications happened a year earlier,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1299" target="_blank">00:21:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and I was like gearing up towards it. I also had some friends who moved from the UK to the US.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I was dabbling with like, do I want to move to the US for residency? Do I want to take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1307" target="_blank">00:21:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the US MLE and do all that crap? So I got the resources. I signed up to Pathoma. I started</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1312" target="_blank">00:21:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">doing some practice questions, realizing, oh my God, this is so hard. And thankfully the YouTube</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1317" target="_blank">00:21:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">channel took off that year. - And was this also, was there an extra</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1321" target="_blank">00:22:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">incentive or pressure that when the Australia plan fell through, you were thinking, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually need to pick up some more revenue from my YouTube channel because this is a source of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1330" target="_blank">00:22:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">revenue that's not coming. So was there a, I'm going to take this thing a little bit more seriously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1334" target="_blank">00:22:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">for pragmatic reasons. Was there an extra bolt of energy or was it already doing well at that point?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1340" target="_blank">00:22:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">- Yeah, I think the YouTube channel was maybe making about 20K a month at that point. And my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1346" target="_blank">00:22:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">salary as a doctor was making 3K a month. So already I was like blew past my doctor's salary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1351" target="_blank">00:22:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But randomly at the end of 2020, I decided, you know what, let me make a course teaching people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1356" target="_blank">00:22:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">how to do YouTube because people have been asking for it. And then that completely took off and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1361" target="_blank">00:22:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">ended up taking over my life for the next like two years. And then that was the first year that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1365" target="_blank">00:22:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the business did a million pounds in revenue. I was like, bloody hell, I've never seen a million</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1368" target="_blank">00:22:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">quid before in my life. This is insane. - So walk people through like a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">how YouTube revenue works. So like when you're coming into fall of 2020, you're talking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1376" target="_blank">00:22:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">20K, I guess, pounds per month. At this point, YouTube would be mainly sponsorships. So this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1385" target="_blank">00:23:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">just a mix of automatically inserted ads from YouTube plus perhaps like sponsorships you sold</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1393" target="_blank">00:23:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">yourself and you say to camera. So mainly some combination of that was going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">- Yeah, ish. So three big sources of revenue at the time. The first one was AdSense, which is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1402" target="_blank">00:23:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">five second ads that appear before YouTube videos. That was maybe making like 2K a month. Then there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">were sponsorships where weirdly companies will pay like five grand or three grand or two grand for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like this video is brought to you by Skillshare or like Blinkist or Shortform or whatever the thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1417" target="_blank">00:23:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">might be in your case. And so the AdSense and sponsorships were about 5K a month. But weirdly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1426" target="_blank">00:23:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I started making classes on Skillshare in 2019 because I spoke to Thomas Frank and he had a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1430" target="_blank">00:23:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">class on Skillshare and he was making several grand a month. And I was like, wait a minute,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1434" target="_blank">00:23:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you can make online courses on this platform called Skillshare, which is basically free for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">people to access because you can just sign up to a trial and then cancel.

And the first course I made on Skillshare</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">was about how to edit videos.

Interesting. So you're making all this money. You have this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1512" target="_blank">00:25:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">break from your medical training trajectory, and you were being confronted with the complexity and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1518" target="_blank">00:25:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">difficulty of the next phase of your medical training.

And let's layer on everyone in the fall of 2020. I was writing about this a lot for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the New Yorker at the time was going through this shift of what really matters to me. What do I want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1538" target="_blank">00:25:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">my life really to be like? It was the beginning of this sort of mass reconsideration of the meaning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1544" target="_blank">00:25:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of one's professional life. All of these things hit together. Now, I guess it's not at all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1549" target="_blank">00:25:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">surprising that at some point, I guess it sounds like you're saying by the new year, you said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1553" target="_blank">00:25:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">"No, I'm not going to submit. I'm not submitting my residency application.

Absolutely. Yeah. I enjoyed your articles at the time in the New Yorker. I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1564" target="_blank">00:26:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">reading all these pieces around trying to figure out what to do with your life. So it was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1568" target="_blank">00:26:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm making all this money on YouTube, but like medicine has been my identity this whole time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1572" target="_blank">00:26:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And I had a theory. My theory was, you know what? Let me run a lifestyle experiment. My hypothesis</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1578" target="_blank">00:26:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is that working two days a week as a doctor is fun and I can do three days a week as a YouTuber.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's pretty cool. Why not? And so I ran the experiment. Again, thank you, Tim Ferriss, for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1586" target="_blank">00:26:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">encouraging me to run experiments on my life. And I tried it out. I tried working part-time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1590" target="_blank">00:26:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">because I picked up a few shifts in the emergency department because they knew me and I was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1593" target="_blank">00:26:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">"Hey, can I just come in and do some extra shifts?" They were like, "Sure." And every 10 minutes while</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1597" target="_blank">00:26:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I was there, I was thinking, "What am I doing here?" I could be in the local WeWork right now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1603" target="_blank">00:26:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">which is super nice. And there's actually free coffee there and I can hang out with my team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1607" target="_blank">00:26:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was a workplace that was open during COVID. Why am I in this emergency department that has no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1611" target="_blank">00:26:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">natural light where it's just grim and I'm on the phone trying to convince radiology to do a scan</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1615" target="_blank">00:26:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that they don't want to do? So I ran the experiment for a couple of weeks. I was like, "Wait a minute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1619" target="_blank">00:26:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">This whole theory that I've got that working part-time as a doctor is fun and part-time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1622" target="_blank">00:27:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">YouTuber is fun. This actually does not hold true. So what would it look like if I actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1627" target="_blank">00:27:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">gave that up?" And it was when I did a podcast interview with Lewis Howes, who runs the School</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1633" target="_blank">00:27:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of Greatness podcast, where he was initially interviewing me about passive income ideas and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1637" target="_blank">00:27:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff. And at some point I said to him that, "Yeah, I'm still thinking of staying in medicine." And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1641" target="_blank">00:27:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">he ended up challenging me on that. He was like, "Wait, why do you want to stay in medicine?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, "Oh, but what if my YouTube business crumbles and stuff? I need the money,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1649" target="_blank">00:27:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">right?" And he was like, "Bro, the skills you've gotten over the last 10 years of entrepreneurship,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1653" target="_blank">00:27:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">how long would it take you to make 100k?" I was like, "I don't know, a few months?" He was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1656" target="_blank">00:27:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">"Yeah. How long would it take you to make 100k as a doctor? In the UK, it's like 10 years of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1660" target="_blank">00:27:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">training and then you make 100k as a doctor a year." And so it took Lewis to sort of just push</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1665" target="_blank">00:27:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">me on this for me to realize that I was holding onto this identity of being a doctor because of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1670" target="_blank">00:27:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the status and the prestige and all sorts of fear and financial insecurity around, "Oh, what if I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1674" target="_blank">00:27:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">run out of money?" All of that stuff helped me break through this barrier that I had in my mind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1680" target="_blank">00:28:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of, "I have to be a doctor forever." And I decided to take the plunge and just go full-time on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1685" target="_blank">00:28:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">entrepreneurship, writer, YouTuber-y thing. - And did that close the door? I mean, is it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1690" target="_blank">00:28:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">different leaving in the UK pre-residency? Is that closed the door in the way that if you had said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1698" target="_blank">00:28:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">"No, no, I'm going to persist for another four years. I'm going to get an ED residency. I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1702" target="_blank">00:28:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">going to..." If you had gone through all of that, would you then be in a situation where like, "Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1706" target="_blank">00:28:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">now I could walk away and come back. I'm a fully credentialed doctor." I mean, was there a sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1710" target="_blank">00:28:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">or did not really matter? I mean, whenever you left, it could be an issue. I mean, was that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1713" target="_blank">00:28:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess I'm trying to understand, was there a pressure to like, "Well, why don't you just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1717" target="_blank">00:28:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">finish your training? Then you can always make a decision later." - Exactly. So that was my mom's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1723" target="_blank">00:28:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">whole narrative around this because she's a doctor as well. The issue is that most residency programs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1728" target="_blank">00:28:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in the UK are at least six years long. So it was like six to eight years. And all of a sudden,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that's not a case of like, "Oh, just finish your residency." It's a case of like, "Bloody hell,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1737" target="_blank">00:28:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">another six to eight years of this." And I also, again, one thing that I think you encourage and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1743" target="_blank">00:29:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Tim Ferriss also does as well is speak to the people who are in the position that you think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1746" target="_blank">00:29:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to be in. So I was speaking to a bunch of consultants who, you know, the fully qualified</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1749" target="_blank">00:29:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">doctors are equivalent of attendings and saying, "You know, what advice do you have? Like, do you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1755" target="_blank">00:29:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">wish you'd gotten there earlier? Or do you wish you'd taken your time?" And 100% of them said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1759" target="_blank">00:29:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">"Don't rush to get here. It's not all that it's cracked up to be. It's more fun being a resident</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1763" target="_blank">00:29:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">where actually you can do stuff, but you have no responsibility. It's lonely at the top, man.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1767" target="_blank">00:29:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, don't rush for it." And so I was like, "All right, cool. I don't need to worry so much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1772" target="_blank">00:29:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">about this." Because if, you know, to this day, if I wanted to, I could still go back to medicine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1776" target="_blank">00:29:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It would be a bit embarrassing with all the big game I've been speaking on the internet about like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=1780" target="_blank">00:29:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">making millions and stuff.

At the time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=2415" target="_blank">00:40:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it was like productivity is an equation.

It's feeling good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=2746" target="_blank">00:45:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">about what you're doing is going to lead you to be more productive.

So, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=2775" target="_blank">00:46:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">when you were building out the the YouTube digital business part of your life, and especially as you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=2780" target="_blank">00:46:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">started taking that on full time, were how were you thinking about how do I keep this fun?

And that worked really nicely. That's how I stayed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=2983" target="_blank">00:49:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">consistent with YouTube when I was in med school and when I was working.

And I guess I should care about the numbers. And all of a sudden, it's I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3000" target="_blank">00:50:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">when something is yours, when something is your side hustle, and you're doing it for fun, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3004" target="_blank">00:50:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you're making pocket money, who cares about the numbers?

And as of yesterday, we hit the New York</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3067" target="_blank">00:51:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Times list, which was super cool. Congratulations. Not surprised, but congratulations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3071" target="_blank">00:51:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you. But I've been like not reading the reviews and trying to dissociate myself from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3077" target="_blank">00:51:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">numbers. Because I think when that focus on the numbers just takes all the fun out of everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3083" target="_blank">00:51:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And it probably didn't make a huge difference, I would guess too. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3087" target="_blank">00:51:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">some videos get more views than others, but you probably found when you stop caring about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3091" target="_blank">00:51:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">numbers, you have your core audience and it's probably growing at a certain rate. And there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3097" target="_blank">00:51:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">people doing your courses and it probably didn't make, it probably didn't make that much of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3101" target="_blank">00:51:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">difference, you know, whether or not. Yeah. So that's interesting. And then what about, so for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3106" target="_blank">00:51:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">example, I always guess that when you added Deep Dive, so your show Deep Dive, your podcast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3114" target="_blank">00:51:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">video podcast Deep Dive, that always seemed like something for you. Is that, am I reading that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3118" target="_blank">00:51:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">right? You're thinking like, I want to spend, because if you're a YouTuber, you're trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3122" target="_blank">00:52:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">just build the biggest possible subscriber base or whatever. It's like, that's not the way you do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3127" target="_blank">00:52:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it. I guess you would focus on more videos and make a, you know, bigger retention in the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3131" target="_blank">00:52:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">30 seconds. So is that an example, adding that to your portfolio, an example of you're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3135" target="_blank">00:52:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this would be fun. I could have long, I could talk to people who are interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3138" target="_blank">00:52:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. That's how it started off. I was like, we're never going to grow a big podcast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3144" target="_blank">00:52:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but that's fine. This is a cool thing. It's a great way to make friends and speak to people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3148" target="_blank">00:52:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">who I would otherwise be less likely to be able to speak to. Over time, Deep Dive also became a job</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3154" target="_blank">00:52:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">because we, there's, there is a, I think I've read it over time. There is a sweet spot when it comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3161" target="_blank">00:52:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to productivity and optimization. So we optimized the hell out of Deep Dive to grow Deep Dive. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3167" target="_blank">00:52:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I started batch filming podcast episodes. We started schedule things, scheduling things way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3173" target="_blank">00:52:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">ahead of time. We started doing a bunch of research into titles and thumbnails and topics that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3177" target="_blank">00:52:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, people, the guests hadn't talked about before. And it made the podcast grow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3182" target="_blank">00:53:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but it took a lot of the joy away from it. To the point that I've actually decided I'm going to take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3186" target="_blank">00:53:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">a bit of a pause from Deep Dive and figure out like, do I really want to continue doing the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3190" target="_blank">00:53:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">podcast in this format? Yeah. Because for example, what I love to do is being like, hey, Cal, let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3195" target="_blank">00:53:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">send you an email. Let's hop in a Zoom call and just shoot the shit about like our experiences</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3198" target="_blank">00:53:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">with the traditional career ladder versus, I don't know, other, like the creator life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3205" target="_blank">00:53:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But actually that episode that you and I did, I had the conversation that I wanted to have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3209" target="_blank">00:53:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and the first half of it was completely unrelatable for most people. We weren't talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3212" target="_blank">00:53:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">about productivity. We were talking about what it's like being a tenured professor and how you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3216" target="_blank">00:53:36.160</a></span> | <span class="t">deal with like the challenges of like also having like books and creative stuff you're doing. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3220" target="_blank">00:53:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">why are you still doing that? And it was so interesting for me, but it was not useful for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3225" target="_blank">00:53:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of the, a lot of the audience. Some of the audience loved it. Oh my God, like you never hear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3228" target="_blank">00:53:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">these conversations. And we optimized Deep Dive to the point that it became less fun. And so after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3233" target="_blank">00:53:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">doing some soul searching a couple of months ago, actually, I was thinking, do I really want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3237" target="_blank">00:53:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">continue doing Deep Dive? And I want to continue doing the interviews. Like if you're hanging out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3242" target="_blank">00:54:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in London, let's get together, book a podcast studio and just chat and record it. That would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3247" target="_blank">00:54:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">be fun. But scheduling you and 20 other people in a given week that I have to then be somewhere for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3253" target="_blank">00:54:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">batch filming, it's like all of the optimization sucks the joy out of it. And I've been trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3259" target="_blank">00:54:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">find this sweet spot between like optimizing for fun and optimizing for growth with everything in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3264" target="_blank">00:54:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the business. So do you think about your business from the standpoint now more of like revenue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3270" target="_blank">00:54:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">floors than revenue optimization? Like, Hey, as long as we're like here, it's all gravy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3275" target="_blank">00:54:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so like beyond that, let's have fun. I don't want to fall below that, but like, Hey, we could,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3281" target="_blank">00:54:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we have a lot of flexibility. Now you set a floor at a reasonable place and you have a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3284" target="_blank">00:54:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">flexibility in how you run things. Is that a reasonable way? That's literally exactly how I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3290" target="_blank">00:54:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">think about it. I think of it as a profit floor rather than a revenue floor. I'm like, if we did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3294" target="_blank">00:54:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">2 million profit this year, great. Anything above that feels like a bonus. There's still naturally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3299" target="_blank">00:54:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the sense of like, Oh, we did 2.8 million last year. So like, let's do 2.9, 3 million this year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3304" target="_blank">00:55:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I read books like 10X is easier than 2X where I'm like, fuck, okay. What about 20 million?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3309" target="_blank">00:55:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I speak to entrepreneurs doing like 50 million a year in revenue. I'm like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3312" target="_blank">00:55:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Whoa, that would be fun. But one thing the team always says to me is that anytime I come back from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3318" target="_blank">00:55:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the US, they have to ignore whatever I say for three days. Because usually when I'm in the US,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3323" target="_blank">00:55:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm surrounded by people way richer than I am. And I start getting this bug of like, Oh man,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3326" target="_blank">00:55:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd be so much happier if we had a hundred million revenue. And then I realized after a few days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3330" target="_blank">00:55:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And also I'm sure you get, when you're in the US, how many times have you had someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3334" target="_blank">00:55:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">come up to you now and say like, Ollie, we need a, we need a Netflix show. This is like another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3340" target="_blank">00:55:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">very US thing is like, this would really do it. Like if you need a TV show, which is like a talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3345" target="_blank">00:55:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">about like a terrible time suck doing TV, uh, you know, you know who it's interesting.

I think Joe Rogan has had a big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3374" target="_blank">00:56:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">impact on that. And the, the, the two things being, um, him building cool places to do his work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3383" target="_blank">00:56:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And I know it's very insider baseball, the most people, but the podcasters,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3387" target="_blank">00:56:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">this was very influential as he, he, you know, he rents out these warehouses and he puts like a gym</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3391" target="_blank">00:56:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in it and has like a pool table in it.

For me on, on YouTube, the inspiration has always been Peter McKinnon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3451" target="_blank">00:57:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and the way he's been doing it for like seven years now, photo video tutorials.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3455" target="_blank">00:57:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But he also seems to just talk about whatever he wants.

That would be cool. And I almost prefer his solo episodes of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3490" target="_blank">00:58:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the podcast compared to the interviews.

It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3494" target="_blank">00:58:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of cool. I think, you know, what's the sort of vlog I would, I would, I would love for Cal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3499" target="_blank">00:58:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Newport or James Clear to have.

Actually, it was, I had a really, really good conversation with Mark Manson</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3522" target="_blank">00:58:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a few, a year ago, actually.

But what Mark said, because I was like, you know, man, you're living the dream,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3533" target="_blank">00:58:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">right? You've got the books, the New York Times bestsellers, 20 million copies, a Hollywood film.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3537" target="_blank">00:58:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Why are you doing YouTube videos? Because he was taking YouTube seriously. And he was like, look,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3542" target="_blank">00:59:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">man, I've had all the traditional media success. And I realized at the end of it, making YouTube</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3547" target="_blank">00:59:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">videos is more fun and reaches more people and makes more money. I was like, oh, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3551" target="_blank">00:59:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">That's interesting. Which again, was that, was, was to that point around like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3556" target="_blank">00:59:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the grass always seems greener on the other side of the fence. But actually, everyone's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3563" target="_blank">00:59:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">life works for them. And you just got to enjoy the journey. And I sound like a spiritual wooboo</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3567" target="_blank">00:59:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">doctor.

So what should you keep in mind if you're a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3572" target="_blank">00:59:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">listener to this interview?

Power is another one. Power is like a sort of combination of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3661" target="_blank">01:01:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">having autonomy, but also feeling a sense of progress, feeling like you're leveling up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3665" target="_blank">01:01:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when it comes to autonomy, obviously, entrepreneurs and media people have autonomy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3671" target="_blank">01:01:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">over a lot of what they do, but even if you don't have autonomy over what you do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3674" target="_blank">01:01:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you almost certainly have autonomy over how you do it.

But I had a whole thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3688" target="_blank">01:01:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">about how I realized that working on weekends was way more fun and way more energizing than working</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3695" target="_blank">01:01:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">on weekdays. It's kind of random, like, why is that? On weekends, there's less people around,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3700" target="_blank">01:01:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">there's more work to do, there's more emergencies coming in and there's fewer and there's less</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3703" target="_blank">01:01:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">support. And on weekdays, everyone's around.

It's like, oh, you know, the potassium was 4.8 or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3724" target="_blank">01:02:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever the thing might be. But on weekends, there was no, that middle layer was gone. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3729" target="_blank">01:02:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">so I was the one who had to think, shit, what was Mrs. Smith's potassium?

But I think there's something counterintuitive in that we think of our energy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3759" target="_blank">01:02:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">as being like a battery almost.

Like if you try and do the bare</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3770" target="_blank">01:02:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">minimum, if you try and coast, if you try and just watch the clock and just do the minimum to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=3774" target="_blank">01:02:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">through your day job, that's really soul sucking and really draining.

So that advice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=4293" target="_blank">01:11:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is helpful for them.

I mean, just a couple, but that's more rare. Okay, here's my other YouTube question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=4343" target="_blank">01:12:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">What about these videos?

My younger listeners keep talking to me about this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=4356" target="_blank">01:12:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">as being the big thing.

We like to keep an eye on what sort of videos are doing the rounds and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=4366" target="_blank">01:12:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">what's going viral and 14-hour study with me, how I'm able to study for 14 hours without breaks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=4372" target="_blank">01:12:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">People love that stuff. And it's weird because obviously you and I know that that's not effective</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=4377" target="_blank">01:12:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">at all. And having made some of these videos, I know that it's like, I can tell that these,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=4382" target="_blank">01:13:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that video was actually filmed in three different sittings.

And there's almost a romanticization of, "Hey, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=4406" target="_blank">01:13:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it's so aesthetic. I was like on my desk with my textbooks, highlighting and rereading and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=4412" target="_blank">01:13:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">making my pretty notes. And I was doing that for 16 hours. Aren't I a good student?" And then the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=4416" target="_blank">01:13:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Instagrammification of people's study notes and stuff now gives you clout points for having the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=4420" target="_blank">01:13:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">prettiest looking notes that you've made by just copying them out of a textbook, even though we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=4423" target="_blank">01:13:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">know that's completely ineffective.

Whereas what you and I talk about is, bruv, deep work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=4432" target="_blank">01:13:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">small amounts of time, do the thing, focus on the thing, active recall. It's not that hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=4437" target="_blank">01:13:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's not as sexy or Instagrammable to say, "Hey, I did my flashcards for 25 minutes and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=4443" target="_blank">01:14:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I took a break." Okay, that's interesting. So our summary here is, it depends on the medium.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=4447" target="_blank">01:14:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So when it comes to productivity and getting things done, some of these online medium really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=4451" target="_blank">01:14:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">are creating some notion. It's like a hustle culture, but for various reasons. And a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=4457" target="_blank">01:14:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it is probably more about retention and views than it is like, I think, more intellectual critics like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=4464" target="_blank">01:14:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to say, which is that we've internalized narratives of late stage capitalism and we're trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=4470" target="_blank">01:14:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">brainwash effective producers.

I was really interested</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=5299" target="_blank">01:28:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">because to me, this is what I hadn't heard as much about, his transition from being a doctor</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=5305" target="_blank">01:28:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to a YouTuber. I think this gets to a lot of people's daydreams. I don't know if you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=5311" target="_blank">01:28:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">people have this conversation, but it's like, can I just drop what I'm doing and be like on YouTube</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=5319" target="_blank">01:28:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and have these videos about whatever weightlifting and just like, mate, that'd be so great. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=5323" target="_blank">01:28:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone would know who I am. It's like a common daydream. So we got to see with Ollie how he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=5326" target="_blank">01:28:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">actually did it. Two things I noticed, one, it was already really successful before he made the jump.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=5337" target="_blank">01:28:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So he had this very successful YouTube channel when the pressure came from to make a jump,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=5346" target="_blank">01:29:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">because if you remember from the interview, what happened here is he had finished his first phase</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=5350" target="_blank">01:29:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of doctor training. It had its own terminology he used for the UK. If you know the US system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=5355" target="_blank">01:29:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like after your internship year, you did medical school, you did your internship year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=5360" target="_blank">01:29:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you're serving, you can service patients.

And then you go to residency. So he was taking, but they don't call it residency. So it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=5372" target="_blank">01:29:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">also, it was pretty complicated. So he was seeing patients and was going to take a gap year before</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=5379" target="_blank">01:29:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">starting his residency in which he was just going to do like ER work, make some money. And then as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=5384" target="_blank">01:29:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">he talked about that got canceled because of COVID. And that's when he looked up and said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=5388" target="_blank">01:29:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh my God, I'm making like a lot more money off of YouTube than not only what I make in my off</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=5394" target="_blank">01:29:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">year, but like a lot more than I'm going to make as a doctor because doctors don't get paid as much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=5398" target="_blank">01:29:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in the UK." So it wasn't like it was a super courageous decision financially. He was already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=5405" target="_blank">01:30:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">making way more money from his YouTube channel than he ever would as a doctor. So in my book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6vFa781ofE&t=5410" target="_blank">01:30:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So Good They Can't Ignore You, I have a phrase for this.
