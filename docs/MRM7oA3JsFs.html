And in particular our bet really is that when it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">comes to vertical AI applications, the system that you build for incorporating your domain insights is far</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">more important than the sophistication of your models and your pipelines. So the limitation these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">days is not like how powerful is your model and whether it can reason to the level you need it to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it's more it's more can your model understand the context in that industry for that particular customer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and perform the reason that it needs to. And the way that you enable that and the way that you kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">iterate quickly with your customers is by building the system around it. And there's various components to that and that's what I'm going to talk about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is the kind of a high level schematic. And we're going to go through each of these parts throughout the talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">As you'll see right in the middle, there's the PM. And this is, you know, in our experience, it makes sense for this to be a domain expert product manager.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So in our context, it's clinical. And I'm going to go through this in more detail shortly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But first, I think it's worth taking a quick step back and asking, you know, why is it so hard to successfully apply large language models to specialised industries?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We think it's because of the last mile problem. And what I mean by the last mile problem is this problem that I kind of touched on just now around giving the model and your kind of AI system more generally context and understanding of the specific workflow for that customer, for that industry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm going to illustrate that with an example from a clinical case that we've processed, our AI anteriors called Florence and a 78 year old female patient presented with right knee pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">The doctor recommended a knee arthroscopy. And as part of deciding whether this treatment was appropriate, whether the doctor made an appropriate decision, Florence needs to answer various questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">One of those questions is, is there documentation of unsuccessful conservative therapy for at least six weeks?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, on the surface of it, that might seem relatively simple. I mean, I appreciate maybe not a lot of doctors in the room, so you might not know necessarily what conservative therapy is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But actually, there's a lot of kind of like hidden complexity in answering a question like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, you know, conservative therapy, typically what we mean by conservative therapy is when there's some kind of option for, you know, a more aggressive treatment, maybe a surgical operation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">That's like the, you know, the surgical treatment. And then if you're deciding not to operate and you want to try something conservative first, that's like the conservative therapy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So it might be, you know, do physiotherapy, lose weight, do kind of, you know, non-invasive things that might help resolve the problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But actually, there's still some ambiguity there because, you know, in some cases, giving medication might be a conservative therapy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">In some cases, that's actually the more aggressive treatment and there's something else that's more conservative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's one layer of ambiguity there. Then when we talk about unsuccessful, well, what does unsuccessful mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's say that somebody has some knee pain, they do some treatment, and their symptoms improve significantly, but they don't like fully resolve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So is that successful? Do we need like a full resolution of symptoms? Or is it just like a partial resolution is enough?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">If it's partial, like at what point is that enough to be quantified as successful?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, there's kind of complexity and nuance with how that's interpreted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then finally, documentation for at least six weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, you know, documentation, are we saying that the medical record said they started physical therapy eight weeks ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">then it's never mentioned again? We can therefore assume that they've been doing it for eight weeks?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Or do we need like explicit documentation that they started treatment, they did it for eight weeks, and, you know, it's completed?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Where do we draw the line there in terms of what we can infer?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, just kind of coming back to echo our point. So this is really our bet that the system is more important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We believe that in every vertical industry, the, you know, the team, the company that wins, is the one that builds the best system for taking those domain insights and quickly translating them into the pipeline,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then giving it that context and iterating to create this improvements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And we also, you know, I guess to talk to this counterpoint, the models, I mean, models obviously are important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And the progress in models makes it easier to have a good starting point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's only getting up to a certain baseline. And we found we kind of hit a saturation around like 95% level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So we invested a lot of time and effort in improving our pipelines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, 95% is still pretty reasonable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is that performing the, like, primary task that our AI system does, which is approving these care requests in a health insurance context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're at 95%. And we then iterated based on this system that I'm going to walk through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And we really got to, you know, kind of almost silly accuracy of like 99%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We got this class point of light award a few weeks ago for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And really what we found here and what we observed is that the models reason very well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They get to a great baseline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're in an industry where you really need to eke out that, like, final mile of performance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you need to be able to then kind of give the model, give the pipeline that context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So how do we do that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, we call this our adaptive domain intelligence engine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And what this is performing is it's taking customer-specific domain insights</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's converting them into performance improvements and kind of building a system around that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's broadly two main parts to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The first part is the measurement side of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, how is our current pipeline doing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the rest of this is the improvement side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to talk first a bit more about measurement in more detail and then a bit about improvements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So measuring domain-specific performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The first thing, and I think, you know, a lot of this is really just kind of best practice more generally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But the first step is to define what is it that your users really care about as metrics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So in a health context, obviously, I've been talking about medical necessity reviews.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">This is our bread and butter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And there, the customers really care about false approvals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They want to minimize false approvals because a false approval where you've approved care means that, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a patient who didn't need the care might get given some care they don't need.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And obviously, from an insurance provider point of view, they're then paying for treatment that they don't necessarily want to pay for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And often, defining these metrics is like a collaboration between the domain experts in your company and the customers to kind of like really translate what are the metrics that you care about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">There might be like one or two, or like usually there's a few metrics that matter most.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So in a few other industries, like legal, when you're analyzing contracts, it might be that you really want to minimize the number of missed critical terms when you're identifying these clauses in the contract.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">For fraud detection, your top-line metric might be something like preventing dollar loss from fraud.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, education, it might be you want to optimize for test score improvements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=490" target="_blank">00:08:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's definitely a helpful exercise to push yourself to think of like really, if I'm optimizing for like one or two metrics, what is like the metric that is most important?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what you can also do hand in hand with that, which is very helpful, just going off the bottom there a little bit, but is designing a failure mode ontology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I mean by this is taking the task that you're performing and identifying what are all the different ways in which my AI fails.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And it might be at the level of like higher order categories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, here we've got medical record extraction, clinical reasoning and rules interpretation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We found that for medical necessity review, these are the three broad categories, the three broad ways in which the AI can fail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then within those, there's various like different subtypes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is an iterative process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">There's like various techniques for doing this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's important here to bring in your domain experts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one failure mode is that you have somebody kind of looking at your AI traces in isolation and coming up with these who don't necessarily have the context on how things are working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this is a step that's critical to have domain experts leading this process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But really, I think the big value add is when you do both of these at the same time together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Because what this gives you, and this is a dashboard that we've built internally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I appreciate the text might be a little bit small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But essentially, on the right hand side, you have a patient's medical record.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You also have the guidelines that the record is being appraised against.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">On the left hand side, you have the AI outputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is the decision that it's made, the reasoning behind its decision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we enable our domain experts to do here, enable our clinicians, is they can come in, they can mark whether it's correct or incorrect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And if it's incorrect, then this box here is for defining the failure mode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So from that ontology we just saw on the slide before, they can say, this failed in this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And doing those at the same point and having your domain experts sit at that point doing both of these is super valuable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it then enables you to understand things like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So on the x-axis here, we have number of false approvals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the metric that we really care about in our context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we have the different failure modes on the y-axis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And obviously, that tells us that if we want to minimize our false approvals and we want to optimize for this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this top North Star metric that we care about, these are what we want to address first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Kind of in this order.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Which, as a PM, is then a useful piece of information to help you prioritize the work that you want to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the measure side of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm now going to go on to talk about the improvements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And particularly with this domain-specific context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So what that also gives you, this kind of failure mode labeling we talked about before, is you get these ready-made data sets that you can iterate against.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And these data sets are super valuable because they're coming directly from production data, which means you know that they're representative of the kind of input data distribution that you're going to see, more so than synthetic data would be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can now, you know, when you had those priorities on the previous slide, we saw which sort of failure modes were causing the most false approvals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We can then pick that data set of, you know, 100 cases that came through prod in the last week that had this particular failure mode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You can give that to an engineer, an engineer can iterate against it, and you can keep on testing, okay, how is my performance against that particular failure mode right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And that lets you do something like this, where on the x-axis here, we have the pipeline version.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">On the y-axis, we have the performance score.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And by definition, on these floors, we're starting very low for each of these, like, failure mode data sets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But every time you increment your pipeline version, maybe you spent some time focusing on this particular failure mode, and you were able to get a big jump in performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can see the other ones also jumping up as well on kind of subsequent releases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can also use this to then track that you're not regressing on any particular failure mode as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a useful visualization to be able to make.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can then go one step further and actually bring your domain experts into the kind of improvements in the iteration itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And what that looks like is creating this tooling that enables a domain expert who's not necessarily technical to come in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They can then suggest changes to the application pipeline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They can also suggest new domain knowledge that's made available to the pipeline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And obviously, they're the best position to be making these kind of, you know, opinions of what sort of domain knowledge might be relevant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you have your pipeline in the middle that's ready to use those if it wants to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And on the right-hand side, you have those domain evals, which might be these failure set evals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You might have more generic eval sets as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And they can then tell you in a data-driven way, okay, given this domain knowledge suggestion from a domain expert,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">should that go live in the platform and now it's in production.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, it should be improving the performance for live customers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And this whole loop can happen very quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, and I think actually on the next slide, yeah, I'll just show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=778" target="_blank">00:12:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a dashboard we saw before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But this is with this extra button, which is like a domain knowledge addition button.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, again, we're keeping the same context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We have, you know, a domain expert clinician coming in here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They're reviewing the case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They're saying, is it correct?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it incorrect?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They're saying, what's the failure mode?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=793" target="_blank">00:13:13.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And now they can say, I think this domain knowledge would be helpful for the application's performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, it might be, I think in this case, I appreciate it might not be that easy to read.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But the model is kind of making some mistake related to understanding suspicion of a condition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the patient like has the condition and it says, oh, there's no suspicion of the condition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But actually they have it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And, like, you could give some information to the model for the medical context of how we interpret suspicious or suspicion as a word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.480</a></span> | <span class="t">That would then influence the answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Or it could be that maybe the reasoning uses some kind of scoring system and you realize actually the model doesn't have access to that scoring system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You could, again, you could add that as domain knowledge to continually build out what the model can handle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And what that helps with, yeah, in terms of kind of the iteration speed from that, you can do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you want to let your evals automatically let that go in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Or maybe you want to have some kind of human in the loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But it just means that you can have this very quick process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">This prod case comes through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You analyze it through a clinical lens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the same day, you've essentially fixed it because you added the domain knowledge that should solve it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You can prove that with the evals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it's live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And what this means is that these domain expert reviews that are really kind of powering a lot of the insights you're getting here are giving you three main things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They're giving you performance metrics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They're giving you these failure modes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're giving you these suggested improvements all in one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you define domain expert?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what level are we talking about?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, good question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So the question is, how do you define a domain expert?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=887" target="_blank">00:14:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what level of expertise do you need here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=889" target="_blank">00:14:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it really depends on the specific workflow that you're doing and what you're kind of optimizing for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So in our context, if you're optimizing for clinical reasoning and the quality of the clinical reasoning, you therefore want somebody with as much clinical experience, ideally a doctor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Ideally, they have relevant expertise in the speciality that you're dealing with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But it kind of really depends on your use case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It might be that there's actually simpler things we also can do, in which case that level of expertise is not necessary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And you could have a more junior clinical person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But the idea being that it's either like a nurse or a doctor or somebody that has experience of doing this workflow in the real world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=926" target="_blank">00:15:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that make sense?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, another question?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you elaborate a little bit more on the tooling for the domain expert?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, is this bespoke tooling or is this something off the shelf?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, this is bespoke tooling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think in general, my philosophy on this is that if you're really placing a lot of weight on what you're kind of generating and this feeds into your system in various other different ways in the kind of ways I'm describing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it probably makes most sense to do this with bespoke tooling that you build yourself because you want to integrate it into the rest of your platform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's just generally going to be easier to do that if you're kind of like doing everything yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Are these, like are your domain experts users or are you paying them to come in and eval?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, great question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it can be both.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We, like in our experience, typically we start with we will hire some people in-house who kind of come and do this for us to give us this initial data so that we can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that iteration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there's definitely a world in which the customer themselves might also want to do validation of your AI and they might actually do this kind of process themselves,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in which case this then becomes a customer facing product for them to use as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I love the questions, but we're going to reserve time for Chris to keep going.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, sounds good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm just, there's the last couple of slides now as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So putting everything together, this is the overall flow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And essentially what this can look like is you have your production application.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It's generating these decisions, these AI outputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You're having your domain experts review that, giving these performance insights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.480</a></span> | <span class="t">That's things like the metrics, the failure modes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1022" target="_blank">00:17:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You then have your PM, your domain expert PM who sits in the middle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They then have this rich information on, okay, what should I prioritize based on the failure modes, based on the metrics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They can then turn to an engineer and say, I want you to fix this failure mode because I really care about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And I want you to fix it up to this performance threshold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So they can say right now, you know, in production, we're getting 0% or 10% on this particular data set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I want you to go away and work on this until you get to 50%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the engineer can go and, you know, run different experiments, have different ideas of how they might improve this, changing prompting, changing models, doing fine tuning, all this kind of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They then have a very tight iteration loop because they have these ready-made failure mode data sets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1058" target="_blank">00:17:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They can run the eval.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They can see the impact of those evals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And then once they've kind of done that loop and they're hitting the percentage that they need, they can then go and give it back to the PM and say, hey, here are the changes I made.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1068" target="_blank">00:17:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The PM can then take that information and make some decision about going live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They can take those eval metrics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They can look at the kind of wider context of what this change might impact elsewhere in the product and then decide whether to go live with that in production.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So final takeaways just to wrap up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1090" target="_blank">00:18:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, to build a domain-native application, you need to solve the last mile problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1094" target="_blank">00:18:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">This isn't solved by just using more powerful models or more sophisticated pipelines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1098" target="_blank">00:18:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You need what we call an adaptive domain intelligence engine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Domain experts can power their system by reviewing their AI outputs to generate metrics, to generate failure modes, and to generate suggested improvements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is really powerful because it takes production data live from kind of inside your customer's context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1113" target="_blank">00:18:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And it uses that to give your LLM product the nuanced understanding of the customer workflows and continually iterate towards that and eke out the kind of final performance level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And the end result is you have this self-improving data-driven process that can be managed by a domain expert PM sitting in the middle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRM7oA3JsFs&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.480</a></span> |
