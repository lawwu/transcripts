That means a very important point that in all these cases, all these games are different. Go, for instance, is much more complex than chess. It's more abstract, more strategic, so it's more difficult to accumulate sophisticated knowledge as we did in chess. But all these games, they represent closed systems, which means we humans fill the machine with a target, with rules. There's no automatic transfer of the knowledge that machines could accumulate in closed systems to open-ended systems. Machines can do many things, and they will learn even more things in the future, but I don't see any chance in the foreseeable future for machines to ask the right questions. Now, they can ask questions, but they don't know what questions are relevant.</p></div></body></html>
