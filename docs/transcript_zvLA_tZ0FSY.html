Let's talk about what those are and how they're probably taking away our time. - So the busy bandwagon is where these defaults show up in culture. So the expectation that you say yes to every meeting, that you should constantly monitor your email and respond right away, that you should be busy, that being busy is a sign that you are a successful person.</p><p>And I think we all find ourselves either on the bandwagon or wishing we were on the bandwagon at some point in our lives. The infinity pools, that's kind of our term for the places where defaults show up in our technology and in our media and content. Anytime there's an infinite source of content, there's always water in the pool.</p><p>You can always jump back in. The bad news is that those are really irresistible. They're very effectively designed and engineered and optimized to be irresistible.</p></div></div></body></html>
