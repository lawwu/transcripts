Hello Sophie I don't think you've joined us before is that right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been here, just quietly in the background sometimes. Okay, thank you for joining we're about to you visiting us from in Brisbane.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, good on you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what do you work with AI stuff for you just getting started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Not all background in psychology, doing a postdoc in psych, and sort of, yeah, kind of move over into data science. Okay, cool. Have you done a lot of the statistical side of psychology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah, quite a bit and quite a bit of coding in our, but I'm pretty new to Python so okay great big learning curve. Well you know what you're, you're a target market right so if you have any questions along the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just jump in even things that you feel like everybody else must know. I guarantee not everybody else does. So, yeah, definitely. These have been really helpful and really great running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Awesome.

So, training three models parallel right now. Yeah, so I've got three GPUs in this machine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, yeah, one nice thing with with weights and biases is you basically, let me show you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so here's weights and biases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to use my Mac very much because nothing's locked in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Alright, and so you can see it's running this thing called a sweep, right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's going to be 477 runs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't know why it says create 31 seconds ago because that's certainly not true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to be running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, it's coming from this get repo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like there's a, there's a suite view, because this is a particular run. This is, this is a particular run. That's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm terrible with a query, to be honest. Okay, so let's go to the project. Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then a project has sweeps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, okay, this one here I can kill out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically you kind of say on the, on the Linux side WNB, you know, sweet create or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there's things all grouped under this thing. Okay, so then, yeah, so then basically it runs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">lots of copies of your program feeding at different configurations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, you can run the client as many times as you like so I've run it three times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">At each time I've set it to a different career device. You turn your models into Python scripts into able to do this or exactly. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=757" target="_blank">00:12:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so this is fine tuned up pie so it's just calling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it causes parks, so that's going to just go through and check what batch size, etc etc etc you asked for right sticks them all into this pasta thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it calls train passing in those arguments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=780" target="_blank">00:13:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so then train is going to initialize weights and biases for this particular project for this particular entity which is fast AI using the configuration that you requested.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so then you can say for example okay there's got some particular data set some particular batch size and image size etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it creates a learner for some particular model name, some particular pooling type.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Fine tunes it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then at the end logs, how much GPU memory used what model it was how long it took.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you don't have to look much because the fast AI weights and biases integration automatically tracks everything in the learner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see here there's all this like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">learner dot architecture learner dot loss function etc etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So curiosity, then was this process of refactoring into a script painful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, I'm so actually probably actually tell I didn't do this Tom Thomas compel did this if I had done it, I would have used fast fast quarter script instead of this stuff, I guess.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, no, it wouldn't have been painful I would have just chucked in nb dev export on the cell that I had in my notebook and that would have become.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, my script.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, wouldn't hide Jeremy painful hi.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a question within within need be interesting to track a power consumption, for example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, for some people it might be not for me as to how you would track how consumption I have no idea you'd have to have some kind of sense are connected to your power supply, I guess, they track a lot of system metrics in the runs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So like, if you look on a run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They will track like GPU memory CPU memory. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, yeah, if you click on the thing on the left.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It looks like a CPU chip, that thing yeah there's a lot of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe there's power in here, I don't see how it can be right because like it. Well, unless the Nvidia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That does, you go. GPU power so it video tells you the GPU power usage apparently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Tell you about your CPU, etc power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The thing that's useful about this I think is the memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, well, I mean the key thing is the maximum memory use so we actually track that here in the script.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, we put it into GPU man.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.

Yeah, so he.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=997" target="_blank">00:16:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I had never used it before. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">probably most people have never heard of this but first day I actually has a thing called fast GPU, which is what I've previously used for doing this kind of thing so in general when you've got more than one GPU, or just even if you got any one GPU and you got a bunch of things you want to run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's helpful to have some way to say like okay here's the things to run, and then set a script off to go and run them all and check the results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, fast GPU is the thing I built to do that. And the way fast GPU works is that you have a whole list of the whole directory of scripts in a folder, and it runs each script run at a time and puts them in that runs and it puts them into a separate directory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, to say this is completed, and it tracks the results, and you can do it on like as many your few GPUs as you like it at August, go ahead and run it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is fine but it's very basic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I kind of been planning to make it a bit more sophisticated. And yeah weights and biases takes it a lot further, you know, by.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1072" target="_blank">00:17:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I kind of want to read, read to or add something on top of fast GPU so it is fairly compatible with weights and biases but you could do everything locally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the key thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1085" target="_blank">00:18:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the thing it's actually using to for that config file is it goes through the basically the Cartesian product of all the values in this yaml. So it's going to do each of these two data sets planets and pets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1098" target="_blank">00:18:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For this one running rate point eight for every one of these models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For every one of these poolings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for okay this is just the one resize method, and for every one of these experiment numbers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1114" target="_blank">00:18:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a little bit of a project at some point, the, the sweep allows you to run arbitrary programs doesn't have to be a script.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, potentially you could just stay in the notebook and use tiny kernel or sorry, I can be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1134" target="_blank">00:18:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">buying thing or whatever it's called. Yeah, exactly can be. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah yeah no it'd be fun to work on this to make the whole thing, you know, run with notebooks and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">stick stuff in a local SQL live database and because like all this stuff, all this web gooey stuff, honestly I don't like it at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1154" target="_blank">00:19:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the nice thing is it actually doesn't matter because I don't have to use it because they provide an API. So before I realized they have a nice API.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I kept on like sending Thomas these messages saying how do I do this how do I do that, why isn't this working and you'd have to like send me these like pages of screenshots like click here click there turn this off, then you have to redo this three times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm just like, Oh, I hate this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, then I found that within this like we do have an API, and I was like I looked at the API, it is so well documented it's got examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's, it's really nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1194" target="_blank">00:19:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I've put all the stuff I'm working on into this get repo. And so here's a tip by the way the information about if you're in a get repo, the get directory to clone directory the information about your get repo all lives in a file called dot get slash config.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the get repo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we now go to GitHub.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1228" target="_blank">00:20:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One cool thing about this runs is it tracks your get commit like the run you can get back to what code version. Yeah, that is very cool isn't it. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I do think we could pretty easily create a local only version of this without all the fancy gooey, you know, which would also have benefits and people who want the fancy gooey and run stuff from multiple sites stuff like that would use weights and biases, but, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1256" target="_blank">00:20:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you could also do stuff without weights and biases. Anyway, here's our. Yeah, so here's our repo. And this analysis.i.py.mb is the thing that I showed yesterday. If you want to check it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1273" target="_blank">00:21:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll put that in the chat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1279" target="_blank">00:21:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, by the way, you know, I think something else which would be good is we should start keeping a really good list for every walkthrough of like all the like key resources key like, you know, links key commands examples we wrote and stuff like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1300" target="_blank">00:21:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think to do that, what we should do is we should turn all of the walkthrough top topics into wikis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1310" target="_blank">00:21:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if you folks have used wiki topics before, but basically a wiki topic simply means that everybody will end up with an edit button.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1319" target="_blank">00:21:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I just click. Okay, this one already is a wiki. Right. So everybody should find on walkthrough one that you can click edit. Right. And so one thing we put in an edit, for example, would be probably like often Daniel has these really nice full walkthrough listings,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we should have like a link to his reply, which you can get, by the way, by I think you click on this little date here. Yes. And that gives you a link directly to the post, which is handy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1360" target="_blank">00:22:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What about this one?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1363" target="_blank">00:22:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, make that a wiki. Sorry, this is going to be a little bit boring for you guys to watch better than us. We'll do it while I'm here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if anybody else has any questions or comments while I do that. Yeah, Jeremy, you did the first GPU is possible to expand to high performance computing to use it on the note.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1387" target="_blank">00:23:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sorry to do what a pie in high performance computing so in the distributed environment, is it possible to track it as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I don't know. I mean, yeah, I mean, anything that's running in in Python on a Linux computer should be fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1416" target="_blank">00:23:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think some HPC things are like use their own weird job scheduling systems and stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, as long as it's running a normal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Nvidia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1431" target="_blank">00:23:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't even have to be Nvidia honestly. But yeah, as long as it's running a normal Linux environment, it should be fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1440" target="_blank">00:24:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's pretty generic, you know, pretty general. Okay, so they are now all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1445" target="_blank">00:24:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Wikis and so something I did the other day, for example, was in walkthrough for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1450" target="_blank">00:24:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I added something saying like, oh, this is the one where we actually had a bug and you need to add CD at the end, you know, and I tried to create a little list of what was covered.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1458" target="_blank">00:24:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example, maybe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Matt's fantastic timestamps we could copy and paste his list items into here, for instance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1473" target="_blank">00:24:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of radix examples, maybe, or even just to link to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1482" target="_blank">00:24:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so for this walkthrough, we should certainly include this link to the analysis to the IPY and B. Anyway, so you could see, yeah, with the API, it was just so easy just to go API dot sweep dot runs comes in as a dictionary,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1497" target="_blank">00:24:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which we can then check a list of dictionaries into a data frame.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1506" target="_blank">00:25:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, I'm rerunning the whole lot, by the way, because it turns out I made a mistake at some point I thought that Thomas had told me that squish was always better than crop for resizing and he told me I was exactly wrong and it's actually the crops</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1523" target="_blank">00:25:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">always better than squish resizing so running the whole lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Disannoying but shouldn't take too long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1535" target="_blank">00:25:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You find that analyzing the sweep results like this was useful in relative to like what you can see in the UI, you know, you can make so much better hammer. Yes, so much. I was like, I mean, they've done a good job with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That UI like it's very sophisticated and clever and stuff but I just never got to be friends with it. And as soon as I turn it into a data frame is just like, okay, now I can get exactly what I want straight away, it was absolute breath of fresh air, frankly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1572" target="_blank">00:26:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I really like their parallel coordinates chart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1575" target="_blank">00:26:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I find it very difficult to reproduce that in like any visualization library. Do you like in a way, I don't like the parallel coordinates chart, but yeah I mean, there must be parallel coordinates chat to Python out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1591" target="_blank">00:26:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There is there's like a plotly one, but it's not that nice. Okay, because I don't bother with it so like hover over it and stuff and see, you know, what do they do they write their own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1603" target="_blank">00:26:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think so.

Plotly things are normally interactive. So, have you tried that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you know if it's.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1647" target="_blank">00:27:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1650" target="_blank">00:27:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not as nice, but yeah it works like when you hover over you, like, there's a, there's at least a version one doesn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1658" target="_blank">00:27:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that one, it's like, it's very fiddly, you might have to draw a box around it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1665" target="_blank">00:27:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">To, to, to highlight it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1670" target="_blank">00:27:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, yeah.

That's not terrible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1675" target="_blank">00:27:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean it's okay.

I mean, I haven't managed it. I mean I know other people like it so I don't doubt that it's useful for something it's just apparently not useful for the things I've tried to use it for yet, somehow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1702" target="_blank">00:28:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean how do you do you kind of like drag over the end bit to see where they come from or something. Yeah, I mean it might be useful if you want to look at the weights and biases one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1712" target="_blank">00:28:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I think it renders one by default for you for the runs.

And then, yeah, that's what they ended up using for weights and biases, which is really cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1954" target="_blank">00:32:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I kind of like to really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1958" target="_blank">00:32:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">use a much more human driven approach from like well what's the hypothesis I'm trying to test how can I test that as fast as possible, like, most hyper parameters are independent of most other hyper parameters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1971" target="_blank">00:32:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, like you don't have to do a huge grid search whatever and you can figure out so for example in this case it's like okay well learning rate of point oh wait was basically always the best.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1981" target="_blank">00:33:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Try every learning rate for every model for every resize type, etc. that that's just use that learning rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1989" target="_blank">00:33:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Same thing for resize method, you know, crop was always better for the few things we tried it on so don't have to try every combination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=1997" target="_blank">00:33:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And also like I feel like I learn a lot more about deep learning.

You are the Bayesian optimization. Yeah, my brain is that is the thing that's learning. Exactly. And I find like people at big companies that spend all their time during these big, you know, hyper parameter optimizations like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2060" target="_blank">00:34:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I always feel and talking to them that they don't seem to know much about the practice of deep learning, like they don't seem to know like what generally works and what generally doesn't work because they never bother trying to figure out the answers to those questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2073" target="_blank">00:34:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But instead they just chuck in a huge hyper parameter optimization thing into, you know, 1000 TPUs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2086" target="_blank">00:34:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's kind of something that's that's really interesting. I mean, like, do you does it, do you feel like these like hyper parameters generalize across different architectures different models totally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2099" target="_blank">00:34:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, totally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2103" target="_blank">00:35:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, yeah, that was a piece of analysis we did gosh I don't know four or five years ago along with a fellowship today I folks in the platform today I folks, which is trying lots of different sets of hyper parameters that across this different sets of data sets as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2116" target="_blank">00:35:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the same sets of hyper parameters were the best or close enough to the best for everything we tried.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2125" target="_blank">00:35:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2132" target="_blank">00:35:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">With different architectures like I can somewhat imagine that, you know, they just said maybe it's not that super important but you know between transformers and CNS. I mean I'm not questioning this because I don't have any experience to say that this is not correct I think this is wonderful and it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2151" target="_blank">00:35:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It is. It's amazing. So yeah, the fact that across 90 different models that we're testing that couldn't be more different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2162" target="_blank">00:36:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They all had basically the same best learning rate or close enough, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2169" target="_blank">00:36:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a very interesting aspect here is during the learning rate is something that you dump a lot of time into. Usually when you start working on a project or in a competition, you would be naturally inclined to, hey, you know I'm using a different architecture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2186" target="_blank">00:36:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me try to find the experiment with learning rates, but it's nice that you can discuss.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2194" target="_blank">00:36:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I should mention, this is true of computer vision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2202" target="_blank">00:36:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But not necessarily for tabular, I suspect, like all computer vision problems do look pretty similar, you know, the data for them looks pretty similar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2217" target="_blank">00:36:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I suspect it's also true, like, specifically of object recognition so like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2225" target="_blank">00:37:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2227" target="_blank">00:37:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know. I mean these are things like nobody seems to bother testing like which I find a bit crazy but we should do similar tests for segmentation and, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2238" target="_blank">00:37:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">bounding boxes and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2244" target="_blank">00:37:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm pretty sure the same thing. You have the learning rate under. So we suggest maybe some different learning rates are good in different places. Well, the learning rate finder I built before I had done any of this research right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2260" target="_blank">00:37:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2262" target="_blank">00:37:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you might have noticed that I hardly ever use it nowadays in the course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2268" target="_blank">00:37:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't even know if we've mentioned it yet. In this course, maybe we have the last lesson camera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2274" target="_blank">00:37:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Does anybody remember if we've done the learning rate finder yet in course 22. Yeah, I think we did. You think we did. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2283" target="_blank">00:38:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I understand that. Well, one of the really, you can sit there and play with parameters or you like, and schedule wheels and get nowhere. And that's, it's one of the things I'm really taking away from the course is the fact that you're talking about strategy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2301" target="_blank">00:38:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which goes back to Renato Copi at his 2002 paper he had a term called strategy of analysis, and that's something that really stuck with me. And so, that sort of transcends that idea of just mucking around with parameters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2321" target="_blank">00:38:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.

With learning rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2352" target="_blank">00:39:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The defaults a bit lower than the optimal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2358" target="_blank">00:39:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just because I didn't want to like, push it, you know, I'd rather it always worked pretty well, rather than be pretty much the best, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2368" target="_blank">00:39:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2372" target="_blank">00:39:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm just going to go and disconnect my other computer because it's connected to point eight eight eight eight, which is going to mess things up. I'll be back in one tick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2399" target="_blank">00:39:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2428" target="_blank">00:40:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2452" target="_blank">00:40:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, now I think about it, I don't quite know why this is connecting on port eight eight eight nine. But part of this is to learn how to debug problems right so normally, the Jupiter server uses port eight eight eight eight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2470" target="_blank">00:41:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've only got my SSH connected to forward point eight eight eight eight so it's currently not working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2476" target="_blank">00:41:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the fact that using a different port suggests it's already, it's already running somewhere. So to find out where it's running, you can use PS which lists all the processes running on your computer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2488" target="_blank">00:41:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And generally speaking, I find I get used to some standard set of options that I nearly always want and then I forget what they mean. So I have no idea what w au or x means I just know that there are a set of options that I always use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2502" target="_blank">00:41:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that basically lists all your processes, which obviously is a bit too many so we want to now filter out the ones that contain Jupiter or notebook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2512" target="_blank">00:41:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So pipe is how you do that in Linux so that's going to send the output of this into the input of another program and a program that just prints out a list of matching lines is called grip.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2525" target="_blank">00:42:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can grab for Jupiter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2528" target="_blank">00:42:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, there it is. So, I'm kind of wondering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2536" target="_blank">00:42:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where that how that's running. I wonder if we've got like multiple sessions of teammates running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2544" target="_blank">00:42:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't. So teammates LS lists all your teammates sessions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2552" target="_blank">00:42:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I've got a stopped version in the background. Okay, that's why. So I just have to foreground it. There we go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2558" target="_blank">00:42:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That was a bit weird.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2561" target="_blank">00:42:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so now that should work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2567" target="_blank">00:42:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You foreground.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2568" target="_blank">00:42:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, I'll set to put it in the background of G to put it in the foreground. And where do you control that somebody it actually stops it. Right. You can put it in the background and have it have it keep running by actually I'll show you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2585" target="_blank">00:43:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I press control Z and type jobs, that's stopped. Right. So if I now try to refresh this window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2593" target="_blank">00:43:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to sit there waiting forever and never going to finish. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2599" target="_blank">00:43:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it's background back. It's in the stopped in the background. If you type BG optionally followed by a job number, which would be number one, and it defaults to the last thing that you put that you put in the background, it will start running it in the background.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2615" target="_blank">00:43:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Even after you stop there. Yeah, so it's now running in the background. So for that type jobs, it's now running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2624" target="_blank">00:43:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's still attached to this console. So if I open up this, you'll see it's still printing out things right but I'm, but I can also do other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2635" target="_blank">00:43:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't do this very much because normally if I want something running at the same time I would just chuck it in another team x plane.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2644" target="_blank">00:44:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know. It's kind of nice to know this exists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2647" target="_blank">00:44:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Something else to point out is once I said BG it at this ampersand after the job. That's because if you run something with an ampersand at the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2657" target="_blank">00:44:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It always runs it in the background.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2660" target="_blank">00:44:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you want to like fire off six processes to run in parallel, just put an ampersand at the end of each one, and it all run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2668" target="_blank">00:44:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It'll run in the background.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2674" target="_blank">00:44:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2686" target="_blank">00:44:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is a script that runs LS six times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2692" target="_blank">00:44:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so if I run it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2696" target="_blank">00:44:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see they're all interspersed with each other, because it ran all six times at the same time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2703" target="_blank">00:45:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I see. And let's say like you create a process like this in the background without teammates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2709" target="_blank">00:45:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you want to kill it. You use the thing you could you could you could type fj to foreground it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2716" target="_blank">00:45:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, then then press Ctrl C.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2722" target="_blank">00:45:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, something like that would would be fine, or you can you can kill a single job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2729" target="_blank">00:45:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in general, like you probably would want to search for bash job control to learn how to do these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2740" target="_blank">00:45:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And as I said, one of the key as it mentions here, one of the key things to know is that a job number has a percent of the start.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2746" target="_blank">00:45:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is actually percent one would be okay to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2756" target="_blank">00:45:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Knowing what the Google is definitely. Yes, the Google is the key thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2762" target="_blank">00:46:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Although often you can just put in a few examples so you could I'm guessing like if I take Ctrl C, B, G, F, G jobs, which are the things we just learned about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2773" target="_blank">00:46:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There we go. It kind of gets us pretty close. Now we know they've got job control commands.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2787" target="_blank">00:46:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Now, so when I kind of iterate through notebooks, what I tend to do is like, once I've got something vaguely working, I generally duplicate it, and then I try to get something else vaguely working and once that starts vaguely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2806" target="_blank">00:46:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">working, I then rename it to the thing that is what I want. So then from time to time, then I just clean up the duplicated versions that I didn't end up using and I can tell which they are, because I haven't renamed them yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2821" target="_blank">00:47:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is kind of how you can make it like you make a car is looks like you're making copies of it and so you can just click file.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2830" target="_blank">00:47:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Make a copy. Yep. Or in here you can click it and click duplicate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2837" target="_blank">00:47:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I mean, you like, what do you do after you duplicate it you try to open up that I'll open up that duplicate and I'll try something else some different type of parameter and different method or whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2849" target="_blank">00:47:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this case, I started out here in Patty, and kind of just experimented.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2859" target="_blank">00:47:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2860" target="_blank">00:47:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And show batch and find and try to get something running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2864" target="_blank">00:47:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, you know, after that I was like, okay, I've got something working, how do I make it better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2871" target="_blank">00:47:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I created Paddy small, but we've actually made a copy and it would have been called patty copy.ipnB.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2881" target="_blank">00:48:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, oh, I wonder about different architectures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2886" target="_blank">00:48:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I created this, like, I was like, okay, well, basically I want to try different item transforms, different batch transforms and different architectures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2894" target="_blank">00:48:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So create a train, which takes those three things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2898" target="_blank">00:48:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it creates a set of image loaders with those item transforms and those batch transforms, use a fixed seed to get the same validation set each time, train it with that architecture,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2912" target="_blank">00:48:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then return the TTA error range.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2915" target="_blank">00:48:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so then, this is kind of like your weights and biases, like, this is how you keep your different experiments ideas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2924" target="_blank">00:48:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, so now you can see I've kind of gone through and tried a few different sets of item and batch transforms for this architecture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2937" target="_blank">00:48:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is like some just small architectures so they'll run reasonably quickly so these ran in about six minutes or so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2947" target="_blank">00:49:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is very handy, right? If you go sell all output toggle, you can quickly get an overview of what you're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2956" target="_blank">00:49:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so from that I kind of got a sense of which things seem to work pretty well for this one and then I replicated that for a different architecture and found those things which, you know, these are very, very different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2968" target="_blank">00:49:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One's transformers based, one's confident based, you know, find the things which work pretty well consistently across very different architectures and for those then try those on other ones, SWIN V2 and SWIN.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2984" target="_blank">00:49:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, then find, you know, so then let's toggle the results back on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2992" target="_blank">00:49:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm kind of looking at two things. The first is what's the error rate at the end of training. The other is what's the TTA error rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=2999" target="_blank">00:49:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So my squish worked pretty well for both.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3003" target="_blank">00:50:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Crop worked pretty well for both. This is all for Next.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3010" target="_blank">00:50:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This 640x480, 288x224 didn't work so well. I mean, it's not terrible, but it's definitely worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3019" target="_blank">00:50:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And 320x240 instead, you know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3025" target="_blank">00:50:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you talk a little bit about what you're looking for in the TTA versus the final?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3030" target="_blank">00:50:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I just want to say, like, I mean, the main thing I care about is TTA because that's what I'm going to end up using.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3036" target="_blank">00:50:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's the main one, but like, let's see, in this case, this one's not really any better or worse than our best comes next.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3048" target="_blank">00:50:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The TTA is way better. So that's very encouraging, which is interesting. So this is now for VOT, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3058" target="_blank">00:50:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, VIT, we can't do the rectangular ones because VIT has a fixed input size.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3063" target="_blank">00:51:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the final transformation has to be 224x224. So if you pass an int instead of a tuple, it's going to create square final images.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3074" target="_blank">00:51:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, on the other hand, this one looks crappy, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3080" target="_blank">00:51:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So definitely want to use Squish for VIT.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3087" target="_blank">00:51:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then this one looks pretty good, you know. So this was using padding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3094" target="_blank">00:51:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So like for VIT, I probably wouldn't use crop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3101" target="_blank">00:51:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Last time I looked, TTA was not really a thing in other modeling frameworks that is given to you. Is that still the case?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3109" target="_blank">00:51:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No, as far as I know, that's true. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3115" target="_blank">00:51:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, so there are a lot of people, well, one group in particular has been copying without credit everything they can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3122" target="_blank">00:52:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they might have done it. I won't mention their name. But yeah. So SWIN V2, apparently, Tanisha told me is what all the cool kids on Kaggle use nowadays.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3138" target="_blank">00:52:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a fixed resolution. And I found that for the larger sizes, there was no 224. You had the choice of 192 or 256.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3149" target="_blank">00:52:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And 256, it got so slow, I couldn't bear it. But interestingly, even going down to 192, SWIN's TTA is actually nearly as good as the best VIT.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3160" target="_blank">00:52:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I thought that was pretty encouraging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3166" target="_blank">00:52:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This one, interestingly, like VIT, didn't do nearly as well for the crop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3173" target="_blank">00:52:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, like VIT, it did pretty well on the pad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3178" target="_blank">00:52:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then this is SWIN V1, which does have a 224.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3183" target="_blank">00:53:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so here, this TTA is OK, but the final result's not great. And so to me, I'm like, no, it's not fantastic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3193" target="_blank">00:53:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This one's again, you know, it's interesting. The crop, none of them are going well, except for ConNEXT.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3203" target="_blank">00:53:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This one's not great either, right? So SWIN V1, a little unimpressive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3211" target="_blank">00:53:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically, that's what I did next. And then I was like, OK, let's pick the ones that look good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3216" target="_blank">00:53:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I made a duplicate of Paddy small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3221" target="_blank">00:53:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I just did a search and replace of small with large. So we've now got ConNEXT large.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3227" target="_blank">00:53:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the other things I did differently was I got rid of the fixed random seed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3231" target="_blank">00:53:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's no seed equals 42 here. And so that means we're going to have a different training set each time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3237" target="_blank">00:53:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so these are now not comparable, which is fine. You'll see if one of them is like totally crap, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3242" target="_blank">00:54:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But they're not totally comparable. But the point is now, once I train each of these, they're training on a different architecture,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3249" target="_blank">00:54:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">a different resizing method.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3255" target="_blank">00:54:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I append to a list. So I start off with a lefty list and I append the TTA predictions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3266" target="_blank">00:54:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I deleted the cells from the duplicate that weren't very good in Paddy small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3275" target="_blank">00:54:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you'll see there's no crop anymore. Just squish and pad for VIT.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3281" target="_blank">00:54:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the SWIN V2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3286" target="_blank">00:54:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Probably shouldn't have kept both of the SWIN V1s. Actually, they weren't so good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3293" target="_blank">00:54:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then what I did in the very last Kaggle entry was I took the two VIT ones because they were the clear best.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3305" target="_blank">00:55:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I appended them to the list. So they were there twice. So it's just a slightly clunky way of doing a weighted average if you like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3316" target="_blank">00:55:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, stack them all together. Take the main of their predictions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3322" target="_blank">00:55:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Find the arg backs across the main of their predictions to get the predictions and then submit in the same way as before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3330" target="_blank">00:55:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, that was basically my process. It's like it's very not particularly thoughtful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3339" target="_blank">00:55:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's pretty mechanical, which is what I like about it. In fact, you could probably automate this whole thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3344" target="_blank">00:55:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sorry, somebody has to say something?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3347" target="_blank">00:55:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No, no. I was going to say, how critical is this model stacking in Kaggle?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3354" target="_blank">00:55:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just curious how you think about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3360" target="_blank">00:56:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, we should try, right? We should probably submit. In fact, we're kind of out of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3368" target="_blank">00:56:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How about next time? Let's submit just the VIT, the best VIT, and we'll see how it goes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3377" target="_blank">00:56:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that will give us a sense of how much the ensembling matters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3383" target="_blank">00:56:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We kind of know ahead of time it's not going to matter hugely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3392" target="_blank">00:56:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, you specifically said on Kaggle. On Kaggle, it definitely matters because in Kaggle you want to win.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3398" target="_blank">00:56:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But in real life, my small conflict got 97, well, rounded up, that's 98%, and my ensemble got 98.8%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3419" target="_blank">00:56:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that's, in terms of error rate, that's nearly halving the error, so I guess that's actually pretty good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3427" target="_blank">00:57:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Really important question. How do you keep track of what submissions are tied to which notebook?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3433" target="_blank">00:57:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I just put a description to remind me, but a better approach would actually be to write the notebook name there, which is what I normally do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3442" target="_blank">00:57:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But in this case, I wasn't taking it particularly seriously, I guess. So I was only planning to do these ones, and that was it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3449" target="_blank">00:57:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I was basically like, okay, do one with a single small model, then do one with an ensemble of small models, and then do one with an ensemble of big models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3457" target="_blank">00:57:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it was after I submitted that that I thought, oh, I should probably wait for the VITs a bit higher, so I ended up with the fourth one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3464" target="_blank">00:57:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's pretty easy for me, though, you did for significant submissions, so easy to track.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3471" target="_blank">00:57:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, I think now that I know actually that I'm doing a little bit more, because I actually did want to try one more thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3479" target="_blank">00:57:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think what I'll probably do is I'll go back and I'm going to, you can edit these, I'm going to go and I'll put in the notebook name in each one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3486" target="_blank">00:58:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, and then I wouldn't go back and change those notebooks later, unless there was like, I probably never, I would, I would just duplicate them and make changes in the duplicate and rename them to something sensible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3500" target="_blank">00:58:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, this all ends up back in GitHub.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3504" target="_blank">00:58:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I always see, yeah, see what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3510" target="_blank">00:58:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is like, MLOps, Hamill, without.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3516" target="_blank">00:58:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like you have a, you'd like every, like, quote, run is a notebook, like in a way to advise and kind of keep track. Yeah, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3528" target="_blank">00:58:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly. But I mean, the only reason I can kind of do this is because I had already done, like, lots of runs of models to find out which ones I can focus on right so I didn't have to try 100 architectures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3541" target="_blank">00:59:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, in a way, it forces you to really look at it closely. Yeah. If you just, you know, like have this dashboard, kind of like, like, at this role, my view is that this approach, you will actually become a better deep learning practitioner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3557" target="_blank">00:59:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I also believe almost nobody does this approach and I almost feel like there are very few people I come across who are actually good deep learning practitioners, but not many people seem to know what works and what doesn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3572" target="_blank">00:59:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3575" target="_blank">00:59:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Well, that's it, I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3579" target="_blank">00:59:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Thanks for joining again, and yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3583" target="_blank">00:59:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">See you all next time. Bye.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3586" target="_blank">00:59:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zMF2VirA8&t=3587" target="_blank">00:59:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Take care, everybody.</span></div></div></body></html>
