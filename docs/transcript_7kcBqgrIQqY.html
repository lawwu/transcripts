Can you please introduce yourself? Yeah, my name is Jeff Williams. I'm from Word of Grace Bible Church in Battleground, Washington. All right, and Jeff, you've been reading the LSB a little bit. What do you think? I have. In fact, I'm on the board of Grace to You, so I was involvedâ€”not involved directly, but I kept hearing about the status and its development or whatnot, and very excited when it was released.</p><p>And yes, I use it. It's not the primary version that we're using yet in our congregation, but I think that's just a matter of time. Well, and I like the word "yet," right? It sounds like you guys are anticipating. Jeff, we appreciate your faithful service all these years at Grace to You and the other ministries that you do.</p><p>I've bumped into you a few times, and I just want to say thank you for your faithful service. Thank you, Gary. Thank you.</p></div></div></body></html>
