So all limitations, hardware limitations on us, boil down to speed and memory capacity. And both those can be augmented to the level of any other entity that is in the universe. Because, you know, if somebody builds a computer that can think faster than the brain, then we can use that very computer, or that very technology, to make our thinking go just as fast as that.</p><p>As far as explanations go, can we reach the same kind of explanations as any other entity? Let's say, usually this is said in terms of extraterrestrial intelligences, but also it's said about AGIs, you know, what if they are to us as we are to ants? Again, part of that is just hardware, which is easily fixable by adding more hardware.</p></div></div></body></html>
