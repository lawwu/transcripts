I run the developer relations team at Neo4j. Actually, I just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=20" target="_blank">00:00:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">started writing a new book on GraphRag with O'Reilly. So that was my weekend, was writing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=27" target="_blank">00:00:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">chapters. First chapter done. So I think we'll actually put the pre-release version of it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=32" target="_blank">00:00:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">up soon. And what I am going to talk about for the next 10 minutes is agentic GraphRag</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and a little bit about how you can accomplish this. Okay? So, first of all, who here is familiar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">with graph databases? Okay. That's really good. Okay. You are well above and ahead of the curve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.340</a></span> | <span class="t">How many folks have given GraphRag a try to build systems using graphs? Okay. So one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">guy in the back. He is the expert. If you have any questions, ask him. And just to set the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">context on why, is we basically have a problem with a lot of agentic systems where they are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.340</a></span> | <span class="t">not meeting use cases. This was Gartner's prediction of doom and utter failure. And they have a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of hallucinations in them. And so this is an example. I am going to kind of breeze through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">this a little bit. But I basically asked the OpenA3 reasoning API to solve a question about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">biases, reasoning, and math. And the basic problem is it doesn't do a good job if you don't give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.220</a></span> | <span class="t">it enough deep information sources of answering things correctly. And the question is how many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">girls you can fit in a classroom? So like it's a tech computer science bias. It's a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">bit about like math and reasoning because I asked it about a grid. It inaccurately anchors. These</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">are the grid sizes which you could choose on the number of girls you can fit. It inaccurately anchors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in the number of people you can fit in the number of people. And if you don't have a problem, you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">have a problem. And if you don't have a problem, you can fit in the number of people. But if you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">have a problem, you can fit in the number of people. You can fit in the number of people. And you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.200</a></span> | <span class="t">can fit in the number of people. And if you don't have a problem, you can fit in the number of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a square grid. So like the audience, you guys always win against the reasoning AI, even though</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it takes 40 seconds to noodle on this. And it further, so I ask like, are the girls and boys going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to go to home economics or to, whatchamacallit, to sports? And again, this is both a bias and also I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">misled it by giving information about the ratio of girls and boys. And it comes up with an answer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">calculating that all the girls will go to cooking class. Which is horrible. I mean, I'm the chef at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">home and I love cooking. So I think that these are the biases. Now this is kind of funny because we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">reason about the situation and it's like a problem that we can think about. But imagine if this was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like in life sciences about drug discovery. Or if you're solving a supply chain issue. So the fact the LLM</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">has gone and inserted biases. It's done incorrect reasoning along the way. This means you're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to get the wrong business results. And it's very hard to figure this out. So basically the problem is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the LLM is good at extrapolating information like doing language tasks, figuring out things. And it gives the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">impression of intelligence where there's no real intelligence. There's no real kind of human</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">reasoning behind it. And so we over ascribe things that can do. And there's a bunch of things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">can't do well. Now those are things that knowledge graphs are actually really good at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So one way we can solve this problem is by throwing more computers at it, more agents. And agentic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">systems are good at improving the quality of results because you have LLMs talking to each other and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">reasoning with each other about the problem. So basically you have agents who observe, they think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and they take actions. So you have different types of agents which are doing different things in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">workflow. An agentic runtime might look something like this where you're building out and you have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">orchestration layer which is working on the agents. You have some Gen AI models hooked up. You have some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">tools. And then these all collaborate to give you better results than one LLM can give you together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Now the challenge with this is that it's a very monolithic architecture. It's hard to maintain. It's hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to swap out the tools and it also kind of puts you in a situation where you can't secure the system. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">can't do a bunch of things. So a good way to solve this is using MCP. You kind of use MCP as your tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">where your agents are talking to them. With MCP now you have your servers and you have your data sources</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">which are now talking to each other. You have your client and server so now you can give it files or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">database records. You can give it a graph database as the system of record and we built a bunch of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">tools at Neo4j on top of MCP. So we built a Cypher tool which Cypher is the query language for graph</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">databases. So basically it will use -- when you ask the MCP server it gives capabilities to generate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Cypher queries off of prompts or questions or other things you want to pass it. We have a memory module so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this gives you some agent memory you can use to plug into agentic systems. And then we also have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">MCP on top of our cloud APIs if you want to provision databases or do different things on top of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think this is a pattern you'll see with a lot of people who are the vendors or building things is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">now you can plug these tools into your agent architecture and you can use them together with your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">graph. Typically agents are represented in some sort of graph. This is a picture of a lang graph agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can layer memory on top of it. So these are all folks who just spoke in our panel. So Zepp, Cogni,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Memzero, we're all talking about their approach to agents. Actually they all run on top of Neo4j.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So they use Neo4j as the core graph database. Some of them are pluggable so you can choose your graph</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">database of choice. But they're a really good way of giving memory to your agents which is graph based</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and matches the way LLMs want to store, communicate, and retrieve information. And also one of our other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">speakers on the graph track showed his architecture for doing video search and summarization. And if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">notice, they do a bunch of this already, right? So they do short term memory, they have a whole bunch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of lookup information, and they give you a choice of, they have both a graph rag pipeline and a vector</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">pipeline. So I highlighted the graph rag in red. And the reason they're doing this is because when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">use graph rag, you get some advantages in terms of the results coming back and typically a lower rate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of hallucinations. This would be your, like, direct LLMs are kind of, you know, they give you very generic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">responses to a healthcare question. Baseline rag, you get better results back, but it's, it's incomplete</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's doing, basically it's doing vector similarity. So similarity is not relevance. It doesn't mean it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">actually understands the problem. This would be a system which does graph rag, and the typical pattern that would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">get you this is, um, first do your search in a, in a vector search. You can use a vector database. We also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">support vector search on top of Neo4j, and it gives you back results. And that's a good way of translating the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">question into, like, vectors. And then you have mappings from the vector embeddings to your graph, and you, you pull</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">back the nodes which are relevant. So in this case, like, you're asking about a, um, emphysema, you'd get back the, the node for emphysema, you'd pull back all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">related nodes and diagnosis and conditions. And you see it's just, it lists them all, right? So this is a very effective way to get really good responses back when you're dealing with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">something where you, you kind of have this mix of structured and unstructured data. Here's a quick architecture of how you could put this together using, you know, you're using traversal and vector similarity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, you take in the question, you do the query against either vectors or knowledge graphs. Um, graph data science or graph analytics are helpful as well to do community algorithms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">algorithms and groupings and things like this. Um, some of this is in the Microsoft Graphrag paper and other research which is going on in this area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, you feed that back as context to the LLM to improve the quality of the answers. Um, some of the patterns I've talked about quickly. So text to cipher is what our MCP server does.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">it's, it's, it's, it can be good, but sometimes it can be really bad because the generation of cipher by LLMs is not as good as you need it for some cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, the one I was talking about is, as, um, which one was it? Um, basically vector search with graph context, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So you do a vector search and then you use that to pull back related nodes and graph context. That's a really good pattern to start with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, you can also do pre and post filtering of vector results to bubble things which are more relevant to the top of the context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, certain systems, this is quite good as well because all you want to do is make sure the LLM gets things higher up in the buffer for context windows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Even if LLMs now have larger context windows, basically what, what the evals show is they ignore most of it and they look at the stuff at the top.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So a quick example of a company which is doing this. So Klarna basically replaced all of their SaaS systems with a great graph rag project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, they're one of our customers. Um, they took an enterprise wiki's HR systems internal documentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">250k employee questions asked for the first year. 2,000 daily queries processed and 85% employee adoption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So like a really good adoption of this technology. Um, and I'll give you a couple resources and I think we're at time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that about right, crew? Oh, okay. Oh, I see. There's five minutes between sessions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I was, I was rushing to do this even quicker. Okay. So we have time for questions, which is great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so one resource I'd recommend is the, um, Neo4j certified developer program. Um, so with the number</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of hands in the room here for folks who said they know graphs, I'm pretty sure you could all pass the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Neo4j certified exam if you just took it today. And we basically will, we'll mail you a Neo4j certified</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">t-shirt. You get a little LinkedIn badge to put on your profile. And it's a nice way to just show the world</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that, like, you actually know this stuff. Like, you know graph technology, you know stuff. We'll probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">add an additional certifications for, like, you know, graph reg and other stuff in the future. But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the base certified developer class is a good way just to get base knowledge in this. And we do have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">classes in Graph Academy on building chat bots, using LLMs, using all of this stuff as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, second resource is our nodes conference. So the Neo4j nodes conference is an annual conference. It runs in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">three different time zones, 24 hours, all free content, free sessions. You know, come, come out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and join and check out some of this content. Okay. I'll let people finish who want to do the QR code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And thank you very much for coming. And we have a few minutes for questions. Okay. So what we'll do is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">anyone who has questions, just raise your hand and shout it out. If anyone wants to leave the room,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">feel free to do that as well. I don't want to keep you trapped in here. Okay. So in the back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So the question is, like, what the pattern is for doing this type of search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's exactly right. So basically, what you're doing is you're using the LLM for what it's good at,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">which is language translation. So the user can enter whatever convoluted question they want,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">which would never translate to a beautiful cipher query. And then you, you first tell the LLM, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">do a vector search on that, like finds vector similarity in this. And then because you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">generated like the graph and the embeddings to point to each other. Now you can go to the graph and you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">say, well, this, these, these embeddings all point to this node in the graph. So it's probably about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.280</a></span> | <span class="t">in the, in the case emphysema. Now I want to pull back the nodes, which are either like you could use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">cosine similarity or you could use, um, um, community grouping algorithms or different algorithms to figure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">out what's relevant and then pass that as context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Speaker 2: So in a simple architecture, the chunks are the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Speaker 2: What? Speaker 2: The chunks you embed in your nodes are the same pieces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Speaker 2: Yeah. So, so, so like what, what we typically do, and this is what'll happen if you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">um, import unstructured data to Neo4j. Well, we, we, we can create a node structure out of it using LLMs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you hang your embeddings, your text embeddings off as properties off of the nodes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Speaker 2: Um, so we have a couple plugins for this. We have a Neo4j Python library,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">which that has, will do a lot of this. Uh, we also have an integration with Langchain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can use Langchain or, um, llama index or haystack. Yeah. So whatever framework you want to do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you can choose. And we pretty much have integrations with all of them to, to help with the, um, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the associations. Okay. And there were a bunch of hands, but I don't know who's first. So you, you, you can go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Speaker 2: Yeah, I think you said that you have an MCP server for memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Speaker 2: Yeah. Speaker 2: Okay. Does that know also the logic, like the update and so on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Speaker 2: Okay. So, so the question's about like how the MCP agent for memory works. Um, so that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that is a great question, but I actually don't know the answer. It's a, it's an open source MCP server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, now if, if you want the answer, um, the session, which I'm giving with Michael Hunger and Jesus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Speaker 2: Um, in, I don't know, in a, in a bit, um, Michael's team built all the MCP servers. So he,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">he actually will know the answer. And yes, it's, it's today. I think it's right after this or shortly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">after this and Michael will go on for hours if you ask him that. So that's a great question. Okay. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Speaker 2: We're at time. You got the last question. Yeah. So I want to ask about your opinion between</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a Lang chain and Lang graph frameworks. Uh, are they like complimentary or they're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">what's your perspective of that? Um, okay. So the question is like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like Lang chain versus Lang graph. I thought, I thought Lang graph was like the agent thing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=891" target="_blank">00:14:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the Lang chain folks built. No, did you, did you use any of that? Like I'm also new to that. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Speaker 2: Yeah. So we, we have a bunch of experiments and prototypes with, um, Lang graph for,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=904" target="_blank">00:15:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for doing agents and things. Um, we have integrations with Lang chain. We also integrate with all the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">memory vendors. I mean, like I would say from our perspective, use the tool that's best for you and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvVoJBxgSQk&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll integrate with everything. Yeah. Okay. Thanks for coming. Thanks.</span></div></div></body></html>
