physical health, and performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=10" target="_blank">00:00:10.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And now, my discussion with Dr. Matt Walker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=14" target="_blank">00:00:14.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's start off very basic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=16" target="_blank">00:00:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">What is sleep?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=17" target="_blank">00:00:17.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Sleep is probably the single most effective thing you can do to reset your brain and body health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=24" target="_blank">00:00:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Sleep as a process, though, is an incredibly complex physiological ballet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=30" target="_blank">00:00:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Sleep is broadly separated into these two main types.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've got non-rapid eye movement sleep on the one hand, and then we've got rapid eye movement sleep on the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">When you go into REM sleep, you are completely paralyzed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.060</a></span> | <span class="t">You are locked into a physical incarceration of your own body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The brain paralyzes the body so that the mind can dream safely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Because think about how quickly we would have all been popped out of the gene pool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, if I think I'm, you know, one of the best skydivers who can just simply fly, and I get up on my apartment window and I leap out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.340</a></span> | <span class="t">You're done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You're done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, of course, the involuntary muscles, thankfully, aren't paralyzed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So you keep breathing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Your heart keeps beating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You go through these bizarre, what we call, autonomic storms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">There are only two voluntary muscle groups that are spurred from the paralysis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Bizarre.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.180</a></span> | <span class="t">One, your extraocular muscles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if they were paralyzed, you wouldn't be able to have rapid eye movements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And the other that we later discovered was the inner ear muscle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people have argued that the reason the eyeballs are spurred from the paralysis is because if your eyeballs are left for long periods of time inactive, you may get things such as oxygen sort of issues in the aqueous or vitreous humor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the eyeballs have to keep moving in some way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, the drainage systems of the anterior eye are made to require movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.360</a></span> | <span class="t">People with glaucoma have deficits in drainage through the anterior chamber.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe take me through the arc of a night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.340</a></span> | <span class="t">When I first fall asleep, I'll go into the light stages of non-REM sleep, stages one and two of non-REM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I'll start to descend down into the deeper stages of non-REM sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So after about maybe 20 minutes, I'm starting to head down into stage three, non-REM, and then into stage four, non-REM sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And as I'm starting to fall asleep, as I've cast off from the, usually with me, murky waters of wakefulness, and I'm in the shallows of sleep, stages one and two, my heart rate starts to drop a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And then my brainwave pattern activity starts to slow down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Normally, when I'm awake, it's going up and down maybe 20, 30, 40, 50 times a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">As I'm going into light non-REM sleep, it will slow down to maybe 15, 20, and then really starts to slow down, down to about sort of 10 or eight cycles per second, eight cycle waves per second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Then as I'm starting to move into stages three and four, non-REM sleep, several remarkable things happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">All of a sudden, my heart rate really does start to drop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Hundreds of thousands of cells in my cortex all decide to fire together, and then they all go silent together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's this remarkable physiological coordination of the likes that we just don't see during any other brain state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I will then stay there for about another 20 or 30 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So now I'm maybe 60 or 70 minutes into my first sleep cycle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I'll start to rise back up, back up into stage two non-REM sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And then after about 80 or so minutes, I'll pop up and I'll have a short REM sleep period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then back down, I go again, down into non-REM, up into REM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And you do that reliably, repeatedly, and I will be doing that every 90 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.420</a></span> | <span class="t">At least that's the average for most adults.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.060</a></span> | <span class="t">In the first half of the night, the majority of those 90-minute cycles are comprised of lots of deep non-REM sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.540</a></span> | <span class="t">That's when I get my stage three and four of deep non-REM sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Once I push through to the second half of the night, now that seesaw balance changes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And instead, the majority of those 90-minute cycles are comprised either of this lighter form of non-REM sleep, stage two non-REM sleep,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.220</a></span> | <span class="t">and much more and increasingly more rapid eye movement sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And who suffers more, those that lack the early phase and or those that lack the later phase of the night?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Depends on what the outcome measure is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, during deep non-REM sleep, that's where we get this, it's almost a form of natural blood pressure medication.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when I take that away from you the next day, we're usually going to see autonomic dysfunction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">We're usually going to see abnormalities in heart rate, blood pressure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.460</a></span> | <span class="t">We also know that during deep non-REM sleep, that there is a certain control of specific hormones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, we know that the insulin regulation of sort of metabolism, meaning how will you look from a regulated blood sugar perspective versus dysregulated pre-diabetic look of profile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's where deep sleep seems to matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">If we selectively deprive you of that, we can see growth hormone is different, actually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a beautiful demonstration where growth hormone seems to be more REM sleep dependent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why we can come on to the effects of alcohol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's some really impressive, frightening data on alcohol and its disruption of sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But then we also know testosterone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.780</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, peak levels of testosterone happen during REM sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the second half of the night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Which is the second half of the night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

you know, 8 p.m.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm feeling a bit

system, not only am I hit with the same levels of adenosine that I had before I'd had the cup of coffee several hours ago, it's that plus all of the adenosine that's been building up during the time that the caffeine has been in my system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.740</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I would usually say take your typical bedtime and count back 10 hours or eight hours of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=749" target="_blank">00:12:29.780</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the time when you

target="_blank">00:12:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason is because for those people who even just keep drinking up until, you know, into the evening, you're right that they can fall asleep fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe they stay asleep, but the depth of their deep sleep is not as deep anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there are two consequences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.540</a></span> | <span class="t">The first is that for me, and it can be up to by 30%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And for me to drop your deep sleep by 30%, I'd have to age you by between 10 to 12 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Or you can just do it every night to yourself with a couple of espressos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.900</a></span> | <span class="t">The second is that you then wake up the next morning and you think, well, I didn't have problems falling asleep and I didn't have problems staying asleep, but I don't feel particularly restored by my sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So now I'm reaching for three or four cups of coffee the next morning rather than just two or three cups of coffee.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And so goes this dependency cycle that you then need your uppers to wake you up in the morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=810" target="_blank">00:13:30.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And then sometimes people will use alcohol in the evening to bring them down because they're overly caffeinated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And alcohol, and we can speak about that too, also has very deleterious impacts on your sleep as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Caffeine and alcohol represent the kind of two opposite ends of the spectrum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">What happens when somebody has a glass, we always hear a glass or two of wine in the evening or a cocktail after dinner?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=835"

we have a couple of nightcaps,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.080</a></span> | <span class="t">we

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">In truth, what's happening is that you're losing consciousness quicker,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.860</a></span> | <span class="t">but you're not necessarily

target="_blank">00:14:34.900</a></span> | <span class="t">The second thing with alcohol is that it fragments your sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And we spoke about the quality of your sleep being just as important as the quantity and alcohol through a variety of mechanisms,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.200</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Alcohol will actually have you waking up many more times throughout the night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So your sleep is far less continuous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, some of those awakenings will be of conscious recollection the next day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=906"

target="_blank">00:15:09.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, but yet your sleep will be littered with these sort of punctured awakenings throughout the night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, when you wake up the next morning, you don't feel restored by your sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.980</a></span> | <span class="t">The third part of alcohol in terms of an equation is that it's quite potent at blocking your REM sleep, your rapid eye movement sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And REM sleep is critical for a variety of cognitive functions, some aspects of learning and memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It seems to be critical for aspects of emotional and mental health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.640</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would like to ask about marijuana in many places, not all medical marijuana is

up the time with which you fall asleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But again, if you look at the electrical brainwave signature of your falling asleep with and without that THC, it's not going to be an ideal fit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So you could argue it's non-natural.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It too, but through different mechanisms, seems to block REM sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why a lot of people, when they're using, will tell me, look, you know, I, I definitely, I was dreaming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1022" target="_blank">00:17:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't remember, you know, many of my dreams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when they stop using THC, let's say I was having, you know, just crazy, crazy dreams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason is because there is a rebound mechanism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">REM sleep is very clever and alcohol is the same way in this sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the same homeostatic mechanism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people will tell me, look, if I have a bit of a wild Friday night with some alcohol, you know, maybe I'll sleep late into the next morning and I'll just have these really intense dreams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, and I thought I wasn't having any REM sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the way it works is that it's during in the middle of the night, really, when alcohol blocks your REM sleep and your brain is smart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It understands how much REM sleep you should have had, how much REM sleep you have not because the alcohol has been in the system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, in those early morning hours, when you're getting through to sort of, you know, 6, 7, 8 a.m., all of a sudden, your brain not only goes back to having the same amount of REM it would have had, it does that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1081" target="_blank">00:18:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Plus, it tries to get back all of the REM sleep that it's lost.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1085" target="_blank">00:18:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Does it get back all of the REM sleep?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.300</a></span> | <span class="t">No, it doesn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It never gets back all of the REM sleep, but it tries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you have these really intense periods of REM sleep, hence you have really intense, bizarre dreams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what happens also with THC.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You build up this pressure for REM sleep, this debt for REM sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Will you ever pay it back?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1107" target="_blank">00:18:27.140</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't seem as though you get back everything that you lost, but will you get back some of it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, the brain will start to devour more because it's been starved of REM sleep for so long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'd love to chat for a moment about the kind of grand, the original, I should say that, not the granddaddy, but the OG of sleep supplementation, which is melatonin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I was always taught, and I'm assuming it's still true, that the only source of melatonin in the brain and body is the pineal gland.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that still true?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it seems to be from best that we can tell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1140" target="_blank">00:19:00.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I have to imagine we have melatonin receptors in the brain and body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">That's correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Essentially, your brain has a central master 24-hour clock called the suprachiasmatic nucleus that keeps internal time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, it knows 24-hour time, but it needs to tell the rest of the brain and the body the 24-hour time as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And one of the ways that it does this is by communicating a chemical signal of 24-hour NUS, of light and day, using this hormone melatonin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And when it is at low levels or it's non-existent, it's communicating the message, it's daytime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1181" target="_blank">00:19:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And for us, dienol species, it says it's time to be awake.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1185" target="_blank">00:19:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yet, at nighttime, when dusk approaches and the break comes off melatonin and we start to release it, then it signals to the rest of the brain and the body, look, it's dusk and it's nighttime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And for us, dienol species, it's time to think about sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1201" target="_blank">00:20:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Melatonin essentially tells the brain and the body when it's day and when it's night, and with that, when it's time to sleep, when it's time to wake.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.180</a></span> | <span class="t">But it doesn't really help with the generation of sleep itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is why we'll come on to what those studies of supplementation have taught us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So it tells the rest of my brain and body, it's time to go to sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1221" target="_blank">00:20:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It perhaps even aids with the transition to sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's not going to, for instance, ensure the overall structure of sleep or it's not the conductor that's guiding the sleep orchestra, so to speak, throughout the entire night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1234" target="_blank">00:20:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, melatonin is like the starting official at the 100-meter race in the Olympics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.220</a></span>

class="t">It calls all of the sleep races to the line and it begins the great sleep race, but it doesn't participate in the race itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1248" target="_blank">00:20:48.580</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a whole different set of brain chemicals and brain regions.</span></div><div

supplementation, which is, is it helpful for my sleep?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.700</a></span> |

about melatonin, and he essentially said the same thing that you just said, which is very little, if any, evidence that it can improve sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1334" target="_blank">00:22:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet, it's probably the most commonly consumed so-called sleep aid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1339" target="_blank">00:22:19.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Hundreds of million dollars

typically see some benefit, and it often is prescribed, is in older adults.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1346"

target="_blank">00:22:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Because as we get older, you can typically have what's called calcification of the pineal gland, which means that that gland that's releasing melatonin doesn't work as well anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1361" target="_blank">00:22:41.660</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:22:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not the only reason by any stretch of the imagination, but it's one of the reasons, and it's why melatonin supplementation in those cohorts, older adults, especially older adults with insomnia, people have thought about that as maybe an appropriate use case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Do we know how much melatonin is typically released into the bloodstream per night?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1384" target="_blank">00:23:04.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And can we use that as a kind of a rule of thumb by which to compare the typical amount that someone would supplement?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1391" target="_blank">00:23:11.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, typically the supplements for melatonin that I see in the pharmacy and elsewhere and online range anywhere from one milligram to 12 or even 20 milligrams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1402" target="_blank">00:23:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">My guess is that a normal night's release of melatonin, typical for somebody in their 20s, 30s, 40s, would be far lower than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Am I correct or wrong?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's at many magnitudes lower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1416" target="_blank">00:23:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is one of the problems is that I see that too.</span></div><div

milligrams or 10 milligrams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, you know, if you're a supplement company, you know, putting 10 milligrams versus five milligrams, if that's what you're actually doing, you know, it's kind of like the super gulp size.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, nobody wants to lower price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1436" target="_blank">00:23:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">They just want you to, you know, we'll just give you more for the same price and that's how we'll compete.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1441" target="_blank">00:24:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's been this escalating arms race of melatonin concentration and it really does not look meaningful for, you know, for sleep in any way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1452" target="_blank">00:24:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">What we've actually found is that the optimal doses for where you do get sleep benefits in the populations that we've looked at are somewhere between 0.1 and 0.3 milligrams of melatonin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1466" target="_blank">00:24:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, the typical doses are usually 10 times, 20 times, maybe more than what your body would naturally expect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1475" target="_blank">00:24:35.960</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:24:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, it's far above what is physiologically normal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1483" target="_blank">00:24:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I like to think in terms of manipulating any aspect of our biology, that behavioral tools always are the first line of entry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1493" target="_blank">00:24:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Nutrition, everyone has to eat sooner or later, even if you're fasting, then perhaps supplementation, then prescription drugs, and then perhaps brain machine interface devices that you use to induce something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1506" target="_blank">00:25:06.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And those could be done in combination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1507" target="_blank">00:25:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But what concerns me is when I hear people say, well, what should I take without thinking about their behavior, their light viewing behavior, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But of course, these things work in combination.</span></div><div class="c"><span

necessarily require you to, you know, put sort of exogenous molecules.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1527" target="_blank">00:25:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, things like supplements into your body or, you know, use different types of drugs to help you get there.</span></div><div

I've been, again, a little bit too forthright.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1540" target="_blank">00:25:40.820</a></span> | <span class="t">We know in clinical practice that there may be a time and a place for things like sleeping pills.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1547" target="_blank">00:25:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">They are a short-term solution to certain forms of insomnia, but they are not recommended for the long term.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1556" target="_blank">00:25:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we also know that there are lots of other ways that you can get a sleep help or you can get a sleep curative profile from things like cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, which is a non-drug approach, a psychological approach.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.220</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">Very, just as effective as sleeping pills, great data, more effective in the long term.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1575" target="_blank">00:26:15.200</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a recent study published that after working with that therapist, some of the benefits lasted almost a decade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1581" target="_blank">00:26:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if you stop sleeping pills, usually you have rebound insomnia where your sleep goes back to being just as bad, if not worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1589" target="_blank">00:26:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the same is true when we think about supplementation.</span></div><div

when it comes to sleep that don't require venturing out into those waters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRGJVrJBQ8&t=1600"

number of ways that you can do it that don't necessarily require you to swallow anything or inject anything or, you know, smoke anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
