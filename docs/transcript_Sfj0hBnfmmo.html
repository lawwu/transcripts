Not the nicest guy, not today. Not today, next. You came on the wrong thing, my friend. He's breathing hard. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Need a face shot? Yeah! Yeah! I'm not that old. He dies, he dies. He dies, he dies. Any advice? Well, it's actually pretty good. Standing position, I think, sometimes you reach a little bit too much. So, if you reach, reach out to me, it's easy for me to take a good position or reach out to me, I can probably, like, climb back on you. So, what I would suggest is don't reach, like, get closer with your feet before you, you, uh, seek contact with me. So, don't go here. Go closer to each other's shoulder. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Let's go. Okay Hmm Hmm Hmm Hmm Hey Hmm Hmm Hmm Hmm Hmm Hmm Hmm Hmm Hey Hey So how is it different if you're doing MMA? Well there's a lot of difference because in uh in grappling you set up for example when you're fighting In MMA there's different styles I like to be using proactive and reactive takedown Very often I use one of my longest weapons as a decoy to get in your leg use my jab to create a distraction then I can get in Um Other guys for example like Khabib they're more like chain wrestlers they shoot sometimes but they're very good at using for example the fence as like pushing you to the fence and then from there they're using their their wrestling from there I'm more of a more of a dynamic I like to explode so that's one of my strengths which Khabib is very good at for example very good technically and also his isometric strength I heard so he's very good with this style of wrestling Do you think you can take Khabib down? I think I could yeah I think he could take me down as well but So how do I defend against this? So there's many ways First you need to be aware of the distance control That's one of the things I was the best at To master the distance control you need to master the footwork to be always in balance and ready to fight and not to explode A lot of guys they don't know how to manage distance control also because they don't have good footwork they cross their leg they go all over the place so when you move it's important if I go left I push up with my right if I go right I push up with my left I go back I push with my lead I go forward I push with my back This is the basic Thereafter you can use different illusions So if I'm here I look I'm more of a threat to you But I'm at the same distance So one of my favorite ways to set up a takedown a single or double I use my jab which is one of my longest weapons Of course my legs are longer but I like the jab to create the distraction So if I'm here you see me coming So I use a distraction I'm here like a cobra like a snake who launches itself on its prey I'm using my body to So you have a false feeling of security now because you think I can't touch you but because of my leg boom and my and my jab starts outside of your field of vision So I'm not doing this I'm doing it purposely I'm putting it down and I'm here and I'm attracting your attention here because I'm moving my hand boom once I tag you once or twice now I have a perfect set up because in fighting you have a short term memory you always remember what hurts you the last and if it's my jab then I can I plant a seed in your mind and go hop and get in easier When you finish hop you drop There is many ways the best highest per second move is the elbow deep double leg so when I get in I try to look across when I step across so I get in I go elbow deep the reason why I don't only go with my legs is because if you're stronger and bigger than me and you sprawl from there I can have a hard time but if I go elbow deep because of the leverage you can't sprawl I look across and I drive across to put you down sometimes you'll fight a guy like for example Bisping was very strong and I couldn't drive across so when that happens if you can't drive across you turn the corner because they open up on the other side would you like to try? sure so I'm here yes go with your leg elbow deep here and now you're going to drive across yes step across with you if you do it again jab set it up jab now go for it yes exactly and if I give you resistance once you get in I'm strong and I'm sprawling my leg if you turn the corner jab set it up if you find I'm sprawling yes very nice you feel the difference? if he's too strong you go on the other side don't force or waste your energy try to be as economic as you can as possibly you can be what about on the ground what's the difference in Jiu Jitsu for you and MMA? well there's a lot of difference I believe in Jiu Jitsu especially in the guard you can't stay in mid range I cover like this like I'm in a standing position I want to cover like this my head is on the ground my muscles of my abdominals are contracted so it's possible for you to damage here but because I'm contracted it's less likely so I want to focus all the protection on my head are you ok with this? yes it's ok but I want to be here there's a gap where I can see you here if I'm here it's not as efficient because you can go on the side and it's easy for you to grab grab my wrist put it down and hit if I'm here it's harder for you to control my arm if you want to grab it's hard for you to grab so that's the first thing another thing if your hand is right here I want to take away your hand on me I want to pull you to me I want to control your head and your arm and from there there's many options I like to take that clamp because it controls your elevation and you can't hit me it's either I'm very close to you or I'm very far can you try to get up? I can't get up no problem I'm using my leg to push you away or I can use the tip of my feet to create distance so you need to be aware that I can kick you in the head too it's either very close or very far on top? if I'm on top the best position for me to be ultimately is not even mount is to have your back let you to the floor from this position because now you can't hit me I can hit you and I can either knock you out or submit you this is the worst mount is the second best because I'm having a lot of control mount and also with my knees under your armpit the worst would be in your guard so it's not as bad as if you would be in a jiu jitsu competition because I have the gravity on my side but if I'm here I need to respect three rules I never want to let you to put my hands on the floor submission all kinds of things you can very easily wrap my arm and wrap my head close the distance and now it's a thing for me so no way on the floor I don't want you to have your head higher than my head because if your head is higher than my head you have a guillotine it's very hard for me to control and do anything to you if my head is lower than your head and another thing the third thing is I don't want to let you take an angle of me so if you take an angle what did you get at me? you see you need to take an angle so if I take away that angle I kill your offense so my hands always on you never on the floor are you trying to hit a little bit? yeah I can hit them at the same time if you try to raise your head up I don't accept it if you try to take an angle I put you back in line so if I respect these three rules as I'm respecting these three rules I can cause damage even if I'm in the guard I can get to a more dominant position I love it in a nutshell that's what it's about you guys got a chance to train with Elon to watch him train take steps on his martial arts journey what do you think? I think he's very strong much stronger than the average man he's got a lot of heart he's very tough I've always found that by far and away the most important thing to train is how people get into a clash skill level trumps everything else in terms of what's going to turn me out skill beats are skill beats is important that's not to say other things aren't relevant but skill is more relevant from what I understand his proposed opponent has almost two years of training experience that's a big advantage so it will be an uphill battle I will say however though that he deeply impressed both George and myself with his overall ability to grasp his subject and his ability to learn and he's extremely intelligent and sees what is the crux of the problem identifies what needs to be done but I also believe that he's probably one of the busiest human beings on the planet that said these guys doing martial arts training martial arts is pretty phenomenal I think ultimately the deepest lesson is that both of these guys have had an amazing impact on 21st century society and they still have a lot of work to do and I think that they are people who have put themselves in a position where they can create greater benefits for humanity than almost anyone else in the world and so there's a sense in which I wish they would focus more on that than fighting each other alright so one more round this is for everything yes sir this is for the greatest fighter of all time right here yeah nice Thank you, next. Thank you. - Yes.</p></div></div></body></html>
