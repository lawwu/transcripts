This is the top 15 after running a few more sweeps to see if there's some better options but basically, I think what's interesting is in the top 15 pets, you have like a bit of everything right, you've got ResNet RS and ResNet B2 distilled.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, VIT transformers ones, VIT, SWIN, mobile, VIT.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Classic ResNet 2060.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Still in there. Actually the fastest of all, which maybe reflects like maybe that's the most well optimized kind of because it's been around a while and videos probably worked hard on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">ResNet GPU memory, like, yeah, it's kind of interesting the way there's all these very different approaches, but they, they all kind of end up in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, you know, one thing interesting when you look at on the graph is this, these green ones is VIT,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which they kind of cut off here at this fit time of 150. And I think that's because the larger vision transformers only work on larger images and I only did 24 pixel images.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if, if I included larger images, we might see VIT at the very best in terms of error rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was pleasantly surprised to see that some of the VITs, you know, didn't actually use much memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they were pretty fast. And it's interesting because that was quite a while ago, right, the vision transformers paper came out quite a while ago, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it was kind of like the way I remember it was like just tacking together the first and most obvious thing people thought of when it came to kind of making transformers work on vision and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, the fact that it still works so well, it seems that people haven't improved on it much other than perhaps Swin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I guess that my takeaways on the like, small and fast models. Yeah, I guess I hadn't really looked much at resident IRS before so it's interesting to see that one's right up there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then on planet, it doesn't look that different except, you know, it really is just VIT, Swin and Conf Next. In fact, entirely is VIT, Swin and Conf Next.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The whole top 15.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so I guess that's some of the things I noticed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This was able to try so many different kinds of models. Yeah, ran in less than 24 hours on my three GPUs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Something like 1200 runs or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I thought this was interesting. Look at this one, VIT small patch 32 memory usage is amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And speed is fastest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, yeah, third from the top of the small, faster ones. I have a question. Yeah. Can you hear me. Sure. Yes, hi.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just a small question. So you mentioned small and large does large mean the size of the image.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes when I was talking about the IT Yes, it does the IT.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I was specifically just doing 224 by 224 pixel images, and pretty much all the transformer based ones are fixed, they can only do a one size.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the IT models I don't think they have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there's two meetings of larger here this larger as in more bigger models like more layers, wider layers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think all the VIT models which are larger or capacity slower, probably more accurate, I think only run on literally on bigger images, which is like doesn't have to be that way that's just what they happen to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's why.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, the IT only goes this far.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There are bigger VIT models that should be more accurate but they don't work on 224 by 224 pixel images, is there like a good threshold to know when is a good time to use large versus this fall one or is it just all experimental larger images.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You basically do everything on a smaller images you can, as long as it gets you reasonable results, because you want to iterate quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when you're finished and you want to, you know, like it like in the case of Kaggle you want the best accuracy, you can. So you try bigger and bigger images to see what you can get away with and skip doing that, as long as the accuracy improves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In a production environment, it's kind of similar but you make them bigger and bigger until you the latency of your model is too high, you know, you find the right trade off between model latency and accuracy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Generally speaking, larger images will give you more accurate results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But a bit slower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Correct. I mean, a lot slower right because if you know if you increase it from 224 to on one side to 360, then you're going from 224 squared to 360 squared.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you end up with a lot more pixels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So like for for example an application would be like for object detection for video for example like live video, then even if it's a larger size, it will still be good to do small because it's faster.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Certainly for your iterating. There's no need to have a really accurate model for your iterating, because you're trying to find out what data pre processing works best or what architecture works best or whatever so yeah there's no point using large models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and large images generally, as long as they're big enough to get the job done recently well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, thank you very much. Yeah, no worries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You were, you were going to do this in like a business context, let's say, and someone said hey German one to, you know, have a vision model, would you, would you kind of just pick a reasonable one and just kind of go with that and if the results were good, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">would just use it or I would do exactly what I'm doing here, you know, which is to try a few things on, you know, small fast models on small images on a small subset of the data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would look at what data pre processing to use and what architecture to use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I would look at what are the constraints in terms of operationalizing this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How much RAM do we have how much latency can we get away with how's expensive is it going to be to then scale it up to the point at which, you know, we're getting acceptable results using acceptable resources.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I wouldn't look very different at all to, you know, a Kaggle competition in terms of the modeling, but then there'd be a whole piece of analysis around user requirements and costs and stuff like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I tried doing what you're doing was going from smaller to larger models and mine somehow started out with much lower accuracy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it just a fluke or I mean I had several issues happen that and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you press the wrong buttons somehow.

So if I haven't, I'll certainly share them today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe I haven't yet. So I share my notebooks today. So what I suggest you do is like, like, you know, go from mine, make sure you can rerun them and then look at yours and see how they're different and then figure out where you went wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But also like, yeah, you know, I always tell people when debugging like to look at the inputs and the output. So what predictions are you making? Are you always predicting zero, for example, you know, did you run the LR find or define what learning rate works well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, stuff like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No worries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Jeremy, on the question for the production I I tried to after your work for last week, you did mention learn export and then later on we can learn that not know I found that is maybe there's a bug there because when I load and they actually looking for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=665" target="_blank">00:11:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">P suffix is dot PTH. But when we save and they say to the models folder, and then you can keep whatever name you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=677" target="_blank">00:11:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But when you want to load them, they actually have the suffix at the end.

So just to make sure you save it with a dot PTH suffix. But yeah, it certainly would make sense. You're asked to do that automatically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But in the documentation, it seems it's a safe in pickle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The format is pickle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the extent but, but this is just PyTorch so PyTorch uses, you know, a variant of the pickle format, and they normally use PTH as their extension.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yes, it is pickle and just it does use the PTH extension.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Jeremy, when you're opening this window.

Let's have a look. Okay. So, one thing I just did yesterday afternoon was I just trained a model three times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to see what the error rate was, because I wanted to get a sense of like how much variation is there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I found if a user error learning rate of 0.02 and just train for three epochs I seem to pretty consistently get reasonable results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's something I can now do in two minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">See how I'm going. So I thought that would be good. So, this is one thing I really like doing people are often very into doing reproducible training where they have like set the seed for their training and run the same thing every time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's normally a bad idea, because I actually want to see like what the natural variation is and so if I make a change I don't want to know whether that's, you know, changes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The difference I see in the result is might be just due to natural variation, or it's actually something significant. So that's why I did the natural variation is really large.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that every week. Yeah, that's going to be tough to see like, did I improve things but then if the natural variation so large that improvements are invisible and trying to improve it seems pointless right because it sounds like you haven't really found a way to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">stably train something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And normally that happens because my learning rates to be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you try this yourself and bump the learning rate up to point oh four you'll see like at least for me I got like 5% 6% five and a half percent, you know, it's like all over the place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, trading for more epochs at a lower learning rate will generally give you more stable results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a compromise because doing more epochs is slow so that's why I was trying to find a learning rate and the number of epochs which is fast and stable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1089" target="_blank">00:18:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You could also try using a smaller subset of the data or, I don't know, like, in the end sometimes things just will be slow and such as life but most of the time I find I can get a compromise and I certainly did here, I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">with six epochs at half the learning rate I certainly can do better, I can get to 4%, you know, rather than five, but that's okay, I just want something for the testing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that was always counterintuitive to me that I think you talk about is like these improvements that you make on a small scale, like, show up on the larger scale, like always.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1128" target="_blank">00:18:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh yeah, absolutely. Basically, they pretty much always will. Yeah, because they're the same models with just more layers or wider activations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1138" target="_blank">00:18:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, if you find something that's going to, some pre processing step that works well on a ConfNEXT tiny, it's going to work also well on a ConfNEXT large 99.9% of the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1154" target="_blank">00:19:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Most people act as if that's not true, I find, but you know like in academia and stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1160" target="_blank">00:19:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like you have to do a full suite of everything. Yeah, which, like most people just never think to try, but like intuitively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course it's the same, you know, why wouldn't it be the same like it's, it is the same thing just scaled up a bit, they behave very similarly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1184" target="_blank">00:19:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean it's hard to argue with you because it works. So, I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, you can argue that it's not intuitive, that's fine, but like, I feel like the only reason it would be not intuitive is because everybody's told you for years that it doesn't work that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1197" target="_blank">00:19:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you know what I mean? Nobody told you that. I think it'd be like, yeah, of course it works that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1202" target="_blank">00:20:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's fair.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1204" target="_blank">00:20:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so, okay, let's do something crazy. Let's actually look at a model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1210" target="_blank">00:20:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So inside our learner, there's basically two main things. There's the data loaders, learner deals, and there's the model, learner model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1217" target="_blank">00:20:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, and we've seen these before. And if you've forgotten, then yeah, go back and have a look at the older videos from the, from the course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1226" target="_blank">00:20:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the model itself, basically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1230" target="_blank">00:20:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's got like things in it. And in this case, the first thing in it is called a Tim body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1236" target="_blank">00:20:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the Tim body has things in it. The first thing in it is called model, and then Tim body dot model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1242" target="_blank">00:20:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It has things in it. The first thing is called the stem and the next thing is called the stages and so forth, right? So you can see how it's this kind of tree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1249" target="_blank">00:20:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we actually want to go all the way to the bottom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the basic top, the very, there's two things in it at the very top level. There's a Tim body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1259" target="_blank">00:20:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a thing here, which doesn't actually have a name, but we always call it the head.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the body is the bit that basically does all the hard work of looking at the pixels and trying to find features and stuff like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1273" target="_blank">00:21:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's something we call a convolutional neural network.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1276" target="_blank">00:21:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the very end of that, it spits out a whole bunch of information about those pixels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1286" target="_blank">00:21:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the head is the thing that then tries to make sense of that and make some predictions about what we're looking at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1292" target="_blank">00:21:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is the head. And as you can see, the head is pretty simple, whereas the body, which goes from here all the way to here, is not so simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1307" target="_blank">00:21:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we want to predict two things, what kind of rice it is and what disease it has.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1316" target="_blank">00:21:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now look at the very, very, very last layer. It's a linear layer. So a linear layer, if you remember, is just something that does a matrix product.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1328" target="_blank">00:22:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the matrix product is a matrix which takes as input 512 features and spits out 10 features. So it's a 512 by 10 matrix.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's do a few things. Let's grab the head, right? So the head is the index one thing in the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1350" target="_blank">00:22:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's our head.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1353" target="_blank">00:22:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Quick question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1356" target="_blank">00:22:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I've seen these model, sort of, whatever you want to call it x rays, a lot. Have you ever wanted to, like, is there, is there a way that maybe I don't know about to see the shape of the tensors as a flow, the shape of the data as it flows through the model?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, like, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1381" target="_blank">00:23:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't even know about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1386" target="_blank">00:23:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You should try watching some fast AI lectures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1391" target="_blank">00:23:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so this will tell you how many parameters there are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1395" target="_blank">00:23:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, the shape as it goes through. And so the key thing is since we're predicting 10 probabilities, one probability for each of the 10 possible diseases, we end up with a shape of 64 by 10.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The 64 is because we're using a batch size of 64. And for each image, we're predicting 10 probabilities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very thorough and shows the callbacks. Wow. I don't remember this. Yeah, we don't look around, man. Here in fast AI, we're thorough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1422" target="_blank">00:23:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, so I'm back to the question because that's that's a great thing for us to look at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1430" target="_blank">00:23:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, so in the head, let's create something called the last layer, which is going to be the end of the head and the very end of the head.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1444" target="_blank">00:24:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So our last layer is this linear thing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1449" target="_blank">00:24:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this is so we could actually see the the parameters themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1457" target="_blank">00:24:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, I hope it does that. A lot of these things are generated lazily, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you see this thing saying generator object, it's just it's it's literally the word is lazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1468" target="_blank">00:24:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's too lazy to actually bother calculating what it is. So it doesn't bother until you force it to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1474" target="_blank">00:24:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you turn it into a list, it actually forces to generate it. OK, so it's a list of one thing, which is not surprising.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1482" target="_blank">00:24:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. There it is. And so the last layer parameters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1492" target="_blank">00:24:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is a matrix, which is there we go. Ten by five twelve. So it's transposed to what I said, but that's OK.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1502" target="_blank">00:25:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're getting 512 inputs. And when we multiply this by this matrix, we end up with 10 outputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1511" target="_blank">00:25:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1513" target="_blank">00:25:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, my daughter's wanting me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1537" target="_blank">00:25:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sorry about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1541" target="_blank">00:25:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Home schooling transitions always require some input.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.

Which.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1619" target="_blank">00:26:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Have a look.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1623" target="_blank">00:27:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hi, Jeremy. Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1627" target="_blank">00:27:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I was just contemplating whether back in that linear layer where it was the output was ten by five twelve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1636" target="_blank">00:27:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Not the output. That's the matrix. So the output was ten. The output is sixty four by ten.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1641" target="_blank">00:27:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. So when you want to mix diseases with rice in the output, I was wondering whether that might be like I don't know how many rice types there are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1651" target="_blank">00:27:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's five or ten.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1653" target="_blank">00:27:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, so that ten might be ten by ten matrix output. No, two by ten. So you want one probability of what type of race is it and one probability of what disease does it have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1667" target="_blank">00:27:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">OK. Yeah. So just two by ten.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1670" target="_blank">00:27:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's let's go ahead and do the easy thing first, which is to delete the layer we don't want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1676" target="_blank">00:27:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this says sequential. So sequential means like literally PyTorch is going to go through and calculate this and take the output of that and pass it to this and take the output of that and pass it to this and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1688" target="_blank">00:28:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So if we delete the last layer, that's no problem. It's just won't ever call it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1695" target="_blank">00:28:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can't quite remember if we can do this in sequential, but let's assume it works like normal Python.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1703" target="_blank">00:28:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We should be able to go to delete.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1707" target="_blank">00:28:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">H minus one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1711" target="_blank">00:28:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That looks hopeful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1713" target="_blank">00:28:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, we can. OK, so it's got normal Python list semantics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1720" target="_blank">00:28:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this model will now be returning 512 output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we want to basically wrap it in a model which instead has two linear layers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1746" target="_blank">00:29:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a couple of ways we can do this, but let's do it like the most step by step away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1753" target="_blank">00:29:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We just need to wrap it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1755" target="_blank">00:29:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the second look. So we're going to create a class. Right. So in PyTorch, modules are classes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1761" target="_blank">00:29:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So we're going to take a class which includes this model. Right. So let's call this class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1771" target="_blank">00:29:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Disease and type classifier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1778" target="_blank">00:29:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. Now that is a.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1782" target="_blank">00:29:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">PyTorch calls all things that it basically uses as layers in a neural net a module. So this is a neural net module.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1791" target="_blank">00:29:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if you haven't done any programming in Python before, it would be very helpful to read a tutorial about basic Python programming,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1800" target="_blank">00:30:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because PyTorch assumes that you are pretty familiar with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1805" target="_blank">00:30:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you've done any kind of OO programming before, I'm going to work on the assumption you have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1811" target="_blank">00:30:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then the constructor. There's a lot of weird things in Python. The constructor is called dunder init. So this is this is so dunder means underscores on each side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1822" target="_blank">00:30:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it always passes in the object being constructed or the object we're calling it on first. So we'll give that a name.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1830" target="_blank">00:30:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we're basically going to create two linear layers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1836" target="_blank">00:30:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And one easy way to create the correct kind of layer would be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1841" target="_blank">00:30:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Self dot one because we could do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1847" target="_blank">00:30:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So one question is like I understand this sub classing thing. Yeah. Is there some other way that you could push to two additional layers onto the existing thing or does that make any sense?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1862" target="_blank">00:31:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, we could try that. Let's see if we get this one working and then we'll try the other way. How about that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1867" target="_blank">00:31:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we could also try using fast.ai has a create head function as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1875" target="_blank">00:31:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll see how we go. So here's here's linear layer number one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1881" target="_blank">00:31:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you can see, I literally just copied and pasted. It's inside the end sub module. So I just had to add that. But the representation of it is nice and convenient and that I can just copy and paste it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1893" target="_blank">00:31:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In real life, we never normally write the in features now features. Everybody kind of knows that the first two things are in and out features. So let's make it look more normal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1905" target="_blank">00:31:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So then the second layer and, you know, then maybe we'll like just give ourselves a note here. So we'll use this one for rice type and we'll use this one for disease.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1919" target="_blank">00:31:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, so at this point, once we create this is going to be these things are going to be in it. And then we also need to wrap the actual model. Right. So we'll just call that M and we'll just store that away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1935" target="_blank">00:32:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">M equals M. So what happens is when PyTorch calls like basically modules act exactly like functions in Python in Python terms are called callables that act exactly like functions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1950" target="_blank">00:32:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But the way PyTorch sets it up is when you call this function, which is actually a module, it will always call a specially named method in your class and the name of that is forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1963" target="_blank">00:32:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have to create something called forward and it will pass the current set of features to it, which I normally I always call X. I think most people call it X if I remember correctly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1980" target="_blank">00:33:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is going to contain a 64 by 512 tensor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1990" target="_blank">00:33:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=1998" target="_blank">00:33:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">No, it's not going to contain a 64 by 512 tensor. It's going to contain an input tensor. This is going to be a model. So we need to create the 64 by 512 tensor from it by calling the model like so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=2015" target="_blank">00:33:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So results. In fact, what we often do is we'll go X equals because we're kind of making it like a sequential model going X equals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCkpjXHdTc&t=2023" target="_blank">00:33:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, you know, another idea is we something else we can try is we can make this whole thing as a sequential model.
