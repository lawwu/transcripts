I really dislike rocking, but now you got me rocking. So tell us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=10" target="_blank">00:00:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">why rocking and things like it are so valuable and are distinctly different than like, quote,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=15" target="_blank">00:00:15.880</a></span> | <span class="t">unquote, hitting the gym. So I'll tell you how I sort of came to this realization, started writing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=22" target="_blank">00:00:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">about this in the first place, is that when we were in the Arctic, we're hunting, right? So when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.300</a></span> | <span class="t">you look at why humans are good at running, and by the way, we're good at two things. We're good at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">running and we're good at caring. And I'll tell you why we're good at caring. So the reason we're good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">at running is because we evolved to run long distances to chase down animals in the heat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and spear them. So humans are really good at cooling ourselves in the heat, right? And we can run these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">long distances. Other animals can't manage their heat. So we'd slowly but surely run down animals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Eventually, they would get too hot, they'd topple over from heat exhaustion, and then bam,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.180</a></span> | <span class="t">we'd kill them. Okay, so this is a theory called, it's called persistence hunting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So we won the thermoregulation game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">We run the, won the thermoregulation game. Yeah. So we can, we sweat, we don't have much fur,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and then our bodies are also designed for this type of persistence hunting. There's a guy at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Harvard, Dan Lieberman, who had this, I think it was in 2004, paper about this, how the reason we're built</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.220</a></span> | <span class="t">the way we are, one of the key reasons is so we could run long distances for persistence hunting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm familiar with that research, right? I'm like, oh, that's really interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. I'm like, yeah, this explains why I have like, you know, these big butt muscles, these arched feet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.460</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So we go up to the Arctic, we're hunting, eventually successfully hunt a caribou,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.220</a></span> | <span class="t">and we, you know, we're taking every usable part of it we can, so we load our packs with all this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">weight, it's like a hundred something pounds in this damn pack, and start walking back to camp.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm just thinking about this research about, okay, humans evolved to run long distances so we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">could hunt. Great. But what happens after you actually kill an animal? You got to carry that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">damn thing back to camp, right? And so it occurs to me, well, wait a minute, we're also pretty unique</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.300</a></span> | <span class="t">among animals in that we can carry weight. Like no other mammal can just pick up weight on its own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">and carry it a long distance. It's like, huh, that's interesting. So I just start looking into this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and yeah, humans are the only mammal that can pick up a weight and carry it a long distance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and it absolutely shaped us into who we are. It allowed us to really conquer the globe, because we could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.460</a></span> | <span class="t">take tools into the unknown, right? We can walk, we can cover these long distances in our two legs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and our feet. Our hands are freed up to carry our tools, to carry whatever it might be, and it really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">turned us into who we are. Now, the thing is, is when you look at running, plenty of people run,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.540</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Like running and marathons, that is a popular activity. But how many people are just like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.420</a></span> | <span class="t">carrying weight as a regular form of exercise? The answer was really not that many. So I'm thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">like, okay, who actually still maybe does this? And it turns out it's the military. So rucking is sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the main activity of physical training in the military, just throwing weight in a backpack and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">going for a long walk. And I've actually started to sort of even shift my language from using the term</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">rucking to simply saying walking with weight or weighted walking. And the reason for that is, is if I tell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">my mom, hey, you should ruck, she goes, oh, okay. And she types in ruck and she goes, the hell is this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">military stuff, Michael? I'm 75 years old. So I've started to call it more walking with weight. So it's a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">more approachable for the masses. But I think the benefit of it is that you're getting cardio stimulus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">because you're covering ground. But you're also getting strength work because you've loaded your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.900</a></span> | <span class="t">skeletal system, your muscular system. And that comes with a lot of benefits. You kind of got this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.060</a></span> | <span class="t">two in one. So it generally will burn more calories per mile than walking or running. And that is simply</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">because you've added extra weight. Of course, if you're running, you might cover more distance in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">same amount of time. But if you just compare it by distance, it's burning more calories. And I think it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.340</a></span> | <span class="t">one of these activities that can really fill in gaps in people's training. And to what you sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">alluded to in your question is there's a variety of reasons it fills in gaps. But one of them is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">simply that it gets people outside. Like there's a lot of gym people who are like, yeah, I lift all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the weights, but like I'm not doing that running thing. A lot of people can't run and like, oh, by the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">way, walking feels a little too easy. I'm not going to do that. So if you can throw some load on someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and have them go for a walk, it gets them outside, helps them preferentially burn fat,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it seems compared to something like running. So there's this interesting study. And I'll caveat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.020</a></span> | <span class="t">this by saying it was a very small study. I think it was only 12 people because they could only find 12</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.680</a></span> | <span class="t">crazy enough people to do it. It was on backcountry hunters in Alaska. And so these guys carry these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.860</a></span> | <span class="t">heavy packs out into the mountains for a week or whatever. And they test them and they ended up losing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a significant amount of weight, but it was all from fat. They actually gained like a very minute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.340</a></span> | <span class="t">amount of muscle. And that really shouldn't happen in the context of going out and losing weight,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.860</a></span> | <span class="t">right? You're probably going to lose fat along with muscle. But with this, they ended up losing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.800</a></span> | <span class="t">mostly fat. So I just think it's this amazing activity that we really wove out of our lives due to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">technology. Humans evolved to carry. People were carrying babies all the time, like every day in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">the past. We'd go hunt and we'd have to carry all the meat back to camp. We would carry food that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">gathered, like gathering. We're hunters and gatherers. Gathering is literally walking around,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.140</a></span> | <span class="t">finding some food, carrying it, finding more, carrying it back to camp. And then we got, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">cars. We got grocery carts. We got XYZ. We got furniture dollies that we don't carry as much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we've lost a really important form of human movement and physical activity that we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.740</a></span> | <span class="t">literally born to do. And so my suggestion to all the listeners is get some weight and carry it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Easy to throw some weight in the backpack and go for a walk.

So if someone is just starting, I tell them to start light. I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">so after I published The Comfort Crisis with the, there's a chat, there's an entire chapter on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.780</a></span> | <span class="t">walking with weight or rucking. I got all these people in the military, rucking destroyed me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, well, how much did the military start you with? A hundred pounds.

Therefore, no one should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.400</a></span> | <span class="t">deadlift. You need to ease into this. So I tell people, women can start with anywhere from five to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">say 20 pounds to just, um, men, anywhere from 10 to 30, depending on your fitness level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=437" target="_blank">00:07:17.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I would rather have someone really ease in and sort of get used to it. Cause a lot of people will say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, I went a little too heavy and it really sucked. Like I want you to sort of on ramp slowly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then from there you can build up over time. And so I have plenty of, you know, women who might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">weigh 130 pounds who now use 30 pounds, which is a significant amount of weight.

So we know for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">sure. And then they've ramped up to say 40, sometimes 60. I mean, for me, I generally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">my sort of go-to weight is probably 35 to 40 pounds. And I find that that's a weight where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.340</a></span> | <span class="t">it's uncomfortable. It's challenging, but it's also not so soul crushing that I'm like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I got to end this walk.

And of course I'll go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XQgkA_H7z4&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">heavier.
