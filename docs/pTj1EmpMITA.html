And 80% of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.460</a></span> | <span class="t">us have some version of that. So if there's a connection to systemic health, because it'll take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you down, it'll take other organ systems down, it will, it spreads throughout the body. And so it's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">big deal.

Is it bacteria that builds up from all these things in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">your mouth or inflammation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It's complicated, as you would imagine. It hasn't been proven in all cases, 100%. But pretty much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone's behind it. There is a way for bacteria in the mouth to travel throughout the body. There are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">many different conduits. It's you can get past the gums, especially if you have gum issues, which again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.900</a></span> | <span class="t">about after age 45, 70% of us have some form of gingivitis or gum disease. And when you have that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.460</a></span> | <span class="t">that barrier, kind of like inflammation of the gut, kind of the same concept. These bacteria,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and these are different bacteria than you see throughout the body. There's some uniqueness to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">the biome or the oral microbiome as opposed to other biomes. But these bugs wreak havoc. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.460</a></span> | <span class="t">P. gingivalis, one of the big bugs that causes gum disease in the mouth,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">very prevalent in the mouth. That has now made connections to research and studies as a causative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.300</a></span> | <span class="t">agent, not the causative agent, but one of the causative agents of the stimulus for laying down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.200</a></span> | <span class="t">amyloid plaque, which is kind of in the old days, we thought that was Alzheimer's. But now we know that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a sign that you're headed towards Alzheimer's. So that's how the body responds to a bug in the mouth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It becomes inflamed and it lays down the amyloid plaque, which leads to a degeneration of all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">neuronal pathways that leads to dementia. So plenty of other examples with the heart, cancer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.880</a></span> | <span class="t">metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, all of that. Pretty much everything is connected to the mouth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and it can also be bi-directional too. But the mechanism, it's typically through an infection</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">from a bug in the mouth somewhere else in the body. You can just have injury. In other words,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it's kind of like you can damage the tissue. It's not necessarily an infection, but for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you can damage heart tissue to the point where it can't function anymore. It could be a small part of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the heart. And then the last one is inflammation. And if you seed inflammation throughout the body,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.780</a></span> | <span class="t">if it's coming from the mouth and you don't deal with that root cause, then that just continually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">goes on. You'll have elevated C-reactive protein index. In other words, your markers will show that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you're inflamed. A lot of physicians are sometimes just confused because they're working with a patient,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.180</a></span> | <span class="t">it could be a cardiologist working with a patient on heart disease. It could be an endocrinologist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It could be a nephrologist for kidneys. And they're looking at that as one of the markers. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">they don't understand or they haven't been taught in medical school. And we have our dark blind spots</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">too in dentistry. And this is the issue. There's no connective tissue between the two, even though it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the same body, you know, there are two different distinct ways of looking at the body and treating the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.180</a></span> | <span class="t">body. But that nephrologist is going to wreck its brains. If he doesn't know about the gum disease,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">then he doesn't know where the inflammation is coming from. And he can't successfully treat that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.820</a></span> | <span class="t">patient. So it's really kind of a shit show out there, unfortunately. And then again, our insurance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">system is different as well. But the actual way the bugs get into the bloodstream, they can be absorbed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.220</a></span> | <span class="t">through the oral mucosa, which is the inside lining of our cheek, the floor of the mouth. But they're all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.860</a></span> | <span class="t">one cell thick, just like the gut lining. Those bugs can get through to the brain. If it crosses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the blood-brain barrier, it gets into the bloodstream. It can get into tissues, into areas where the immune</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.380</a></span> | <span class="t">system isn't very active. And these bugs are there all the time. And in a healthy person, that's fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.060</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, when you go in for a cleaning and your teeth are scraped and the gums bleed a little bit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.300</a></span> | <span class="t">that patient is experiencing a very short-term transient bacteremia, meaning bugs in the mouth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">are into the bloodstream. But a healthy person can handle that every once in a while. So these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.900</a></span> | <span class="t">bugs will cross through the oral mucosa between the gum and tooth area. That is a very anaerobic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">environment. It's different than the rest of the mouth. The rest of the mouth is more aerobic. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.580</a></span> | <span class="t">oxygen. There's plenty of oxygen and pH balancing saliva. But once you get into those deep pockets and the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.420</a></span> | <span class="t">deeper they get, the more oxygen-hating those bugs become, anaerobes, they also become more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">virulent. And so they're sitting down there. And then there's a breakdown due to a lot of inflammation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">increased blood flow.

And remember, this is the most unique part of the body. You have a hard tissue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">erupting through the body. And the fingernails don't count. They're completely external.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But a tooth has an internal component to the inside of the body systemically. And it has this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.740</a></span> | <span class="t">external component. It's sitting outside. And you can see them. And you chew on them. And they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.440</a></span> | <span class="t">inert. So that area, to seal off that area, is complex. And when it goes bad, the bacteria in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">mouth get into the body. And then, of course, you know, from there, it can be pretty detrimental to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">overall health. So that connection is important. Oral health, systemic health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And is the inverse true? If you have, you know, above average, really optimized and dialed in oral</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">health, can that impact the rest of your body? Can that add years to your life?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. 100%. If I were to answer that in one sentence, and obviously we can talk more about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it, but it would be nourishing and treating your oral microbiome with respect. Not taking it down,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.460</a></span> | <span class="t">not disinfecting your mouth, managing that oral microbiome. It's like the gut microbiome. The gut</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.100</a></span> | <span class="t">is fine. So is the rest of the body when the gut is well. So that means feeding it properly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">taking care of it, making sure the pH is stable, making sure you're not using products,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.420</a></span> | <span class="t">oral care products that actually disinfect the oral microbiome, make it difficult</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">to do what it's supposed to do. I wouldn't have answered that way 15, 20 years ago. It would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.620</a></span> | <span class="t">have been more, see your dentist twice a month. I mean, twice a year, make sure you're brushing and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.260</a></span> | <span class="t">flossing, eat well, don't eat sugar, don't eat candy. That was kind of the standard answer. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">become a lot more nuanced. It's also become more factual, more evidence-based. We now have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.300</a></span> | <span class="t">right information. It's all about the oral microbiome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And is the biggest influence on that food? When you said sugar, I was thinking, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.180</a></span> | <span class="t">as a kid, it was like sugar equals cavities and that is dentistry, right? Like that, that was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">that was my understanding as a child. If the oral microbiome is the most important thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe what are the components of it and how do we influence it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. It's all about for good oral health, for optimal oral health, you need to address all aspects,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.020</a></span> | <span class="t">good or bad. If you're doing something bad for the oral microbiome, that has to be addressed. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">what are the good things you can do for oral microbiome? And it is diet. I mean, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">fermentable, you know, it's sauerkraut. It's, it's not carbohydrates or anything out of a package,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.460</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously, because the bacteria go to town with that stuff. I mean, they overfeed and then they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=496" target="_blank">00:08:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">become dominant. They become bullies in that kind of colony of bacteria. That's not what you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=502" target="_blank">00:08:22.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You're feeding a certain type of bacteria called the S-mutan bug. And by making that a very prevalent bug</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=508" target="_blank">00:08:28.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and a very virulent bug in the, in the biome, you're creating cavities. There are other components</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">though, too. There's pH of the mouth, there's mouth breathing. There is a, you know, if you run a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.380</a></span> | <span class="t">marathon, you, there's a chance that your, your pH will drop in the mouth. You could be dehydrated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">There's certain medications. Uh, there are certain conditions. I mean, the mouth is kind of the pole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.420</a></span> | <span class="t">position in the body. It's, it opens, I mean, and it's the entrance to the digestive tract.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And what's going on with that microbiome every day is that, you know, I've been doing some research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">in preparation. Is that the D and re mineralization of our teeth or, or what's kind of the day in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">life of our oral microbiome? Yeah, that's a great question. That's one component of it. Every time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you have a meal, the teeth demineralize and then the biome that sits on the bio, the biome that sits</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.120</a></span> | <span class="t">in the biofilm brings in calcium phosphate, other minerals from the saliva. Again, that's a bank too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it pulls it past that thin film, the biofilm. And again, if it's dysbiotic and too thick and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">haven't been brushing or you've been feeding it with carbohydrates, that biofilm becomes dysfunctional.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't re mineralize as well, but that's what that little layer does on that inanimate object.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It keeps the calcium from getting pulled out. And if it is, it puts it back in. That's that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">demineralization, remineralization cycle. Again, 15, 20 years ago, it was like you had a hole in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">tooth. That was it. You're done. Get a, get a filling. But now we understand it's dynamic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Which means that, that an early cavity might not need to be filled in 2025, like it did in 2005.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly. Okay. And, and is it important to do something? Or if you have that early sign of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">cavity, um, do you just wait and let the body do its thing? And it's, it's like a bruise where,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, I have a bruise on my arm. I don't do anything about it. I just kind of wait it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It would help to remineralize that area and, and potentiate the environment for that. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and I only say that because we're, we're not in a very good state right now. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.900</a></span> | <span class="t">we're eating junk, we're eating crap.

It's the number one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">disease in the world. It's the most prevalent disease in the world. And there's a reason for it. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.780</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously we're doing something wrong. I mean, and dentistry is part of the problem. We've been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">recommending these products. We haven't been addressing the root causes of what decay is. Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a list of what causes decay and it was very controversial, um, about 10 years ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and then it became less controversial. And then James Nestor, uh, spoke about it in his book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">breath that was during COVID. And now pretty much everyone's on the same page. The number one cause</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.060</a></span> | <span class="t">of cavities, if you're a mouth breather is mouth breathing. It's not the food you eat. It's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.200</a></span> | <span class="t">brushing and flossing the lack of it's not oral hygiene. Uh, so it's really, it's typically mouth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.380</a></span> | <span class="t">breathing, then diet, then brushing and flossing. Again, if you have those first two under control,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.780</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't need to brush and floss. You can see your dentist way less often. And then of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the last one, which we have some control over there's genetics, and then there's some epigenetics and,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and, and, and that all ties in. So, you know, why are you mouth breathing? It has to do with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.580</a></span> | <span class="t">facial development. For context, James has been on the show. We've talked about a lot of the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the health issues. I don't think we went particularly deep on the issues that are in the mouth when it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.640</a></span> | <span class="t">comes to oral hygiene and, you know, our oral microbiome. So that's super helpful. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">for someone who knows that mouth breathing could be bad, understands the impact of cavities. How do you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=731" target="_blank">00:12:11.140</a></span> | <span class="t">connect those dots? What's actually happening when our mouths open all night, or we're reading through it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">that's creating such a, an imbalance in our mouths?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Two things. The most obvious, maybe to most is that your mouth dries out and without saliva or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">without the right, correct amount of saliva, your pH drops. Saliva is essentially continually buffering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">the pH in your mouth. The gut, the gut can buffer itself a lot easier because it's inside,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">but when you're right in front of the outside world and your mouth is open for six, seven,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">eight hours at night. And saliva flow rate drops off anyway at night, even if your mouth is closed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the saliva glands shut down. If you're in deep sleep, that's part of the, the, the restorative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">process.

So it's, it essentially what it does is it allows the bad bugs to proliferate and do more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">damage.

Well, if you're breathing through your mouth at night,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that oxygen uptake is, has, has been compromised because you're over-breathing the CO2.

And what you're doing is you're aiming for the gums and you're just jiggling the bristles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=1973" target="_blank">00:32:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You're not sweeping them or sawing them back and forth.

I mean, the nylon becomes abrasive and then you go in there and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=1999" target="_blank">00:33:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">brush back and forth. You are gouging your tooth surface. I mean, the teeth are hard. The roots are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=2004" target="_blank">00:33:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">less calcified, but that can lead to problems.

But again, hold it lightly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=2020" target="_blank">00:33:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and just, just guide it over the teeth because the electric toothbrush is doing all the work for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=2024" target="_blank">00:33:44.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And then people tend to underbrush with a manual toothbrush, although you can be very adept</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=2029" target="_blank">00:33:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">and you can, you can have full, the full therapeutic effect with a manual toothbrush. It may take a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=2035" target="_blank">00:33:55.860</a></span> | <span class="t">bit longer, but for young people, I would say a manual toothbrush is fine. Just make sure it's a high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=2040" target="_blank">00:34:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">quality one.

And in fact, a lot of that carried over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=2289" target="_blank">00:38:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">into toothpaste.

So I'm not going to tell people not to get dental insurance, but definitely take a look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=3306" target="_blank">00:55:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">at it.

The punchline is this, the insurance payment came to the patient like 1315 days, every single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=3893" target="_blank">01:04:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">time, which by the way, is probably before the credit card bill they paid on was due. And you know, for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=3898" target="_blank">01:04:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">anyone listening that likes points and miles, let's say you have $1,000 of dental work a year, if you pay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=3904" target="_blank">01:05:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">for it, you get points on $1,000, the dental insurance reimburses you. If you go direct to the insurance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=3910" target="_blank">01:05:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">company, now you don't get that spend. So it's an extra 1000 or two or 4000 points that you might have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=3916" target="_blank">01:05:16.500</a></span> | <span class="t">running that model. We were happy as a profession to help support that point system. Yes. That next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=3923" target="_blank">01:05:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">flight to Europe or whatever it may be. Yes, that's dental insurance. I'm sure we could unpack that a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=3928" target="_blank">01:05:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">lot deeper. Oh, yeah. It's a fascinating subject that does not get talked about often enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=3932" target="_blank">01:05:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">One other thing. I remember a time where my sister went to the dentist, and the dentist was like, I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=3937" target="_blank">01:05:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you have four cavities. And she was just blown away. It was a new dentist. So she went to another dentist</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=3942" target="_blank">01:05:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">dentist and got a second opinion. And they were like, you're fine. Right? How important do you think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=3946" target="_blank">01:05:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">someone who gets a diagnosis from a dentist of something like three, four cavities, or even one?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=3952" target="_blank">01:05:52.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it worth getting another opinion on either whether these are real cavities, whether they could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=3958" target="_blank">01:05:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">something treated in other ways, like just letting your body remineralize the area?

This happens a lot. Unfortunately, a lot of the new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=3972" target="_blank">01:06:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">patients I would get would be second opinions with outrageous treatment plans. I don't know if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=3976" target="_blank">01:06:16.700</a></span> | <span class="t">remember, but a lot, maybe 1015 years ago, there was a Reader's Digest article on and the, the journalist</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=3983" target="_blank">01:06:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">went to eight or nine different practices in in her area. And she literally got, you know, every treatment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=3989" target="_blank">01:06:29.260</a></span> | <span class="t">plan was way different than the other one, not just in cost, but in terms of which tooth was being treated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=3994" target="_blank">01:06:34.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was a real problem for the profession. And there were a lot of explanations given,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=3998" target="_blank">01:06:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and then it popped up again later. Someone else, you know, had a slow day in journalism. They tried</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4003" target="_blank">01:06:43.020</a></span> | <span class="t">the same thing and it happened again. So this is a problem. So we have a blog post on this on our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4008" target="_blank">01:06:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">website. It's pretty simple. Gut feeling, you know, if you've been going along every, every twice a year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4016" target="_blank">01:06:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and you get a cavity once or twice a year or less, or you've never had a cavity and all of a sudden</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4022" target="_blank">01:07:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">something has changed, uh, definitely get a second opinion, uh, because this does happen. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4027" target="_blank">01:07:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone quote unquote has a different philosophy. A lot of dentists say, well, if there's any chance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4033" target="_blank">01:07:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of a cavity, I want to go in, well, I can keep it small. Well, but if there isn't a cavity, is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4038" target="_blank">01:07:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">ethical? I mean, and what if the cavity never occurs? Sometimes, um, uh, sometimes root canals are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4044" target="_blank">01:07:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">are jumped to. In other words, there's no need for the root canal. The tooth is hurting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4048" target="_blank">01:07:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's reversible pulpitis. That's a diagnostic code. And if it's reversible, that means that it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4053" target="_blank">01:07:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">could recover. But then the dentist says, yeah, but the patient's in pain. They're going to Barcelona</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4058" target="_blank">01:07:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">next week and we don't want it to blow up in Barcelona. I mean, this is the kind of reasoning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4063" target="_blank">01:07:43.180</a></span> | <span class="t">that goes on either upfront with the patient or without a lot of knowledge for the patient. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4068" target="_blank">01:07:48.340</a></span> | <span class="t">patient's just taking the word of a dentist. So if it seems a little out of whack, like in the case of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4073" target="_blank">01:07:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">your sister, all of a sudden four cavities, absolutely. Those could be cavities that didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4078" target="_blank">01:07:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">exist to begin with. Um, or it could be a cavity that could be reversed. Uh, so definitely get a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4084" target="_blank">01:08:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">second opinion. And you know what, if they resist or get a little funny or, or just throw you a set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4089" target="_blank">01:08:09.460</a></span> | <span class="t">of records, or you don't get copies of the x-rays as quickly as you would like, and it's a difficult</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4094" target="_blank">01:08:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">process, or you pay an exorbitant amount for those copies, then you're probably better off moving on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4100" target="_blank">01:08:20.020</a></span> | <span class="t">There's something wrong there, or they just don't like to be second guessed. A lot of dentists</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4103" target="_blank">01:08:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">don't like to be second guessed. Yep. And I'll just remind everyone that as much as it might seem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4108" target="_blank">01:08:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">in the medical world, like a second opinion is a pretty expensive process. If you're able to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4113" target="_blank">01:08:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">your x-rays from your dentist and you're taken to another dentist for a second opinion, even if it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4118" target="_blank">01:08:38.820</a></span> | <span class="t">weren't covered by insurance, my guess is that second opinion is going to be in the low hundreds of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4124" target="_blank">01:08:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">dollars, if not as much as you might think. Um, right. So as a policy, I'd never charge for a second</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4130" target="_blank">01:08:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">opinion unless we had to take another x-ray, but if it's just a quick look, it's 15 minutes. I did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4135" target="_blank">01:08:55.140</a></span> | <span class="t">that for the betterment of the profession. I did. I wanted patients to do well through the process and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4140" target="_blank">01:09:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it wasn't because I wanted them to stay with me. A lot of the time I would send them back and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4144" target="_blank">01:09:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you know what, they're right. Or it would be a lot of these second opinions are about bad dental work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4149" target="_blank">01:09:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I would send, I would give them an option. There's a very inexpensive option.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4154" target="_blank">01:09:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Instead of hiring a lawyer, there's a peer review system. And I would hook them up with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4159" target="_blank">01:09:19.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Every dental society has a peer review system. They go in, they have three dentists look at it. If it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4164" target="_blank">01:09:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is bad dental work, then the, it gets written up and those that their, their membership is at risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4170" target="_blank">01:09:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So they return the money and then they move on. It's way better than handling it with attorneys and,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4175" target="_blank">01:09:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and the result is better for the patient.

For example, the problem is, and again, we mentioned this in the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4249" target="_blank">01:10:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">in the post, a lot of dental work needs a follow-up. Are you willing to travel back? And then what about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4255" target="_blank">01:10:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">the follow-up and the care? And then if you go to a new dentist, then, you know, they're, they're,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTj1EmpMITA&t=4259" target="_blank">01:10:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">they're taking over that dental work.
