Like it was funny like I would just sit in a room and talk to him like, you know, it's like about $300 for an hour or whatever and They wanted to do everything but have sex and if they thought they could get away with just talking to you for an hour They would just be like this is you know, so money so that you had to talk to the children Yeah, the girls like as an undercover.</p><p>Yeah, but so a lot of times when you You know identify yourself as police all those kind of things then they clam up Yeah, but if you're a John and you're just sitting there and you're asking them about their life Then they're just they're willing to tell you anything to not have to perform a sex act So they'll sit there and talk to you.</p><p>So it's a completely consensual conversation. So it's it's there's no Yeah, rights violations or anything like that. So I would try to get as much if we're gonna meet with you know girls that night Why don't I sit in the room with them and talk to him for 30 or 45 minutes and see how much information I can gain from them before the police come in and they arrest the pimp outside all those kind of things because she might be more willing to tell me a lot of information or if not I can get a lot of information the thing when she's interviewed by a Forensic specialist then they're gonna be able to use a lot of that information have a lot more knowledge when they They try to engage with her and get her services.</p><p>So as an undercover agent, why can't you? You know meet with these children that you is this talking to him in person or is it online? In person, so like why can't you just walk into a room and see that this guy has these children and on the spot?</p><p>So they do it all it's like all alcohol So I will either set up a house or a hotel room and those kind of things the Child will come to the front door There's a car sitting, you know three blocks away You got a surveillance team watching that bring the kid in and then you have to make sure that they're there to you know Perform a sex act like you certified crew, right?</p><p>So you're just making all those steps and so my thought when doing that was like why not get as much information while I can Because the the car is sitting there outside like nothing's gonna happen. So dang that is Crazy to me. I had a 16 year old girl with a pistol in her pocket I was pretty sure she was gonna try to rob me.</p><p>So I had that really yeah Dude, that is a crazy job to work in like that is do you have a lot of trauma like now about that? or it just like not I I Don't have a lot of trauma about it I know a lot of people who have done what I do have a lot of trauma.</p><p>Mm-hmm I feel fortunate. I feel like I have a Great family. I have a great friends that Understand what I go to people like you, you know, I mean like if there was no guys Are you willing to put themselves in these situations? You know We wouldn't rescue these kids in the first place</p></div></div></body></html>
