Also a big restaurant conglomerate in Hawaii. It was awesome. Live music, really fun, great cocktails. Would highly recommend it. That said, it's in the middle of a shopping center. And shopping center vibes is not exactly what I was going for with a relaxing Hawaiian vacation.</p><p>It felt a little chaotic, but the food was great. But it was really easy to get to because one of the perks that I think is a little underrated at the montage and why I think anyone listening should always dig into the details of all the perks at your hotel because I brought this perk up to multiple people we met in the pool and no one had heard of it.</p><p>But they have a Cadillac XT6, which is an SUV that seats six or seven people. And you can just borrow it anytime you want for free for four hours. You couldn't book it. They told us no one's ever using it. So we picked it up, went and got groceries.</p><p>We picked it up, we drove to dinner, had a nice dinner and came home. So really underrated perk that you would have found on the website. You would have found if you asked the front desk, but you definitely wouldn't have found if you had just hoped that they gave you a brochure when you checked in.</p></div></div></body></html>
