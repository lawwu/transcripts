So John begins like this, "In the beginning was the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX7Eb-llxbE&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

All things were made through Him, and without Him</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX7Eb-llxbE&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">was not anything made that was made." That's verses 1 through 3 of John 1. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX7Eb-llxbE&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.180</a></span> | <span class="t">then he adds verse 14, "That Word," the Word, "became flesh," so we're talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX7Eb-llxbE&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus Christ, "that Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen His glory,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX7Eb-llxbE&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">glory as of the only," and the old King James said, "only begotten," I'll come back to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX7Eb-llxbE&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.460</a></span> | <span class="t">that, "Son."

What he called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX7Eb-llxbE&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Word in verse 1, he calls Son in verse 14.
