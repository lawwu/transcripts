And so the political aides and advisors</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">decide the way to do that is to start a war. But they don't start a real war. They basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">manufacture a fake war on a soundstage and in a movie studio. And it's pretty hilarious how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">they keep the whole thing going. David Mamet, who's a brilliant, brilliant writer, wrote that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">script. But this movie came out right around the time of the Lewinsky scandal with Clinton.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so therefore, it took on this larger political and cultural significance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

So, Wag the Dog is, you know, you basically start a war because of the political</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">benefits as opposed to the real necessity of going to war.

That's my generalized observation as manifested in this Carta example in less than a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2525" target="_blank">00:42:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">week. Well, what do you do with some observation like this? If you have this 80% observation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2529" target="_blank">00:42:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">is there anything you could... So then I was like, "Well, you know what? I'm just going to go for it."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2532" target="_blank">00:42:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm starting this thing, and I've been working on this idea for a little bit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2538" target="_blank">00:42:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and I've been experimenting with it with some of my companies. But then I was like, "You know what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2542" target="_blank">00:42:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We should just do this." So the concept here is we're going to build this incubator. It's called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2547" target="_blank">00:42:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">80/90. I have a team. I have a bunch of developers offshore, and we are going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2552" target="_blank">00:42:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">basically create a hit list of software that we think is relatively straightforward</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2560" target="_blank">00:42:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and mispriced and could be built much more efficiently in 2024 using all of these co-pilots</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2566" target="_blank">00:42:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">and tools. Our boundary conditions will be, "Can we deliver 80% of the functionality</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2573" target="_blank">00:42:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">at 10% of the price?" So at a 90% discount. So 80/90 is sort of where you're going?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2579" target="_blank">00:42:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">80/90 is what the name of the incubator is. And what was interesting is when I tweeted this out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2583" target="_blank">00:43:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we had 1,200 people essentially give us a product roadmap.

So what ends up happening is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJEAq0Nsesc&t=2684" target="_blank">00:44:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you attack a category saying, "Oh, this is going to be easy."
