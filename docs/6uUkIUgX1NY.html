And I think there is a big risk here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=1207">00:20:07.940</a></span> | <span class="t">that this just degenerates into sort of hyper politicization, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=1213">00:20:13.240</a></span> | <span class="t">get intensive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=1214">00:20:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">amounts of lobbying by big tech in Washington, that what happens is, you know, you have a good cop, bad cop, where Lena Khan just becomes the bad cop, she's there to kind of keep big tech in line threatens to break them up. And then the good cop is, you know, Biden, and the administration and then they, they become the protection and the extortion racket they raise on, you know, ungodly amounts of money. And really, it'll be a bonanza for for all elected officials, because now, big tech's gonna have to increase his donations even more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=1243">00:20:43.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Wow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=1244">00:20:44.120</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the that's the cynical take. So we could end up with something much worse than what we have now. But, but I think the legit, I think the words you're going to hear a lot, okay, are common carrier, because what she seems to be saying is, look, if you're a tech monopoly that controls core infrastructure, we need to regulate you, like a common carrier, you cannot summarily deny service to your competitors who are downstream applications built on top of your platform. Consumers can get behind that, because that is the argument they've been making about the fact that you're a common carrier. And so I think that's a big risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=1274">00:21:14.020</a></span> | <span class="t">about Facebook cutting off free speech is you are a speech utility.

But because they have this ability</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=1646">00:27:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">to kind of put that Apple Maps in front of you as a consumer, and it's a default on your phone,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=1649">00:27:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">you're more likely to just click on it and start using it and you're done.

If you believe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=1659">00:27:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that consumers will choose what's best for themselves, you're starting to kind of manipulate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=1664">00:27:44.260</a></span> | <span class="t">with the market a bit.

But my experience at PayPal really changed my thinking on this because PayPal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=1676">00:27:56.440</a></span> | <span class="t">was a startup that launched effectively as an involuntary app on top of the eBay market. At</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=1684">00:28:04.060</a></span> | <span class="t">that time, eBay had a monopoly on the auction market. And that was the key sort of beachhead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=1689">00:28:09.340</a></span> | <span class="t">market for online payments. So we launched on top of eBay, they were constantly trying to dislodge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=1695">00:28:15.700</a></span> | <span class="t">us and remove us from their platform. And really, the only thing keeping them from just switching us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=1700">00:28:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">off was an antitrust threat. We actually spun up, you could call it a lobbying operation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=1706">00:28:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">where we would send information to the FTC and the DOJ and say, "Listen, you've got this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=1711">00:28:31.540</a></span> | <span class="t">auction monopoly here that's taking anti-competitive actions against us, this little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=1717">00:28:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">startup." And so we were able to rattle the saber and sort of brush them back from the plate from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=1724">00:28:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">taking a much more dramatic action against us.

But then the second thing, which I saw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=3678">01:01:18.940</a></span> | <span class="t">on Twitter was all these people reminding, uh, anybody who saw the tweet that this exact content</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=3685">01:01:25.540</a></span> | <span class="t">would have not been allowed on big tech platforms were it said three or six months ago.

Well, so what you're saying is now that Fauci has said, this might be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=3775">01:02:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">possibility you're saying it might be a possibility. And John Stewart was having none of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=3779">01:02:59.260</a></span> | <span class="t">it. He ran right over that, said, no, the name is the same. It's obvious. Come on. And yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=3785">01:03:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, Colbert kept challenging him. I don't know if you saw this part where he said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=3788">01:03:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, listen, is it possible that they have a lab in Wuhan to study the coronavirus disease?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=3792">01:03:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Because one, there are a lot of novel coronavirus diseases because there's a big bat population.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=3796">01:03:16.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And then Stewart is like, no, I'm not standing for that.

It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=3801">01:03:21.580</a></span> | <span class="t">the local specialty and it's the only place to find bats.

So it's just great watching. It was, it was a reminder, frankly, of how funny both John</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=3815">01:03:35.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Stewart and Stephen Colbert were about 15 years ago. And I, frankly, I don't think Stephen Colbert</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=3820">01:03:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">is funny anymore because no, because he's gotta keep his job.

He's also too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=3826">01:03:46.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, yes, he's become very polemical. And, and what Stewart reminded us is that comedy is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=3833">01:03:53.260</a></span> | <span class="t">funny when it's making fun of the people who are pretentious and basically who aren't telling the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=3839">01:03:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">truth. And Stephen Colbert has become so polemical that he's lost sight of the comedy and John</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=3846">01:04:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Stewart brought it back.

I do think though,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=3868">01:04:28.300</a></span> | <span class="t">it's sacks. You have to agree.

If you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=3909">01:05:09.340</a></span> | <span class="t">remember after 9/11, there was this idea that comedy was over forever. You were not going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUkIUgX1NY&t=3913">01:05:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">be able to make fun of things.
