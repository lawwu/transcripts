They have been instrumental in our walk with Christ. What would you say to Ashley?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the built-in problems in America at least is that many grandparents have more money, usually, than they have geographic presence or energy to spend with their grandchildren.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Therefore, they tend to make up for the guilt feelings of not being near or having energy by giving them more stuff and more expensive stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing I would say is to the grandparents listening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I know the feeling. I've got 12 grandchildren. I know the feeling of having the resources and wanting to give good things to your grandchildren.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're a Christian, keep in mind that having things and giving things as opposed to having relationships and giving yourself are not always the best way to love.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This takes some serious thought and creative research to discover the kinds of gifts that might really bless the whole family in significant spiritual or educational or recreational ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And under God, the most important people to interact with when thinking these things through is the parents of your grandchildren.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're called your kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We grandparents should put out of our mind once and for all the thought that going around our children to get to our grandchildren is right. It's not right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have no right to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Those children are told by God to be responsive, to be obedient to their parents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Their obedience and responsiveness is to us secondarily and derivatively.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And what that means for us grandparents is that we defer to the parents of our grandchildren, which means we defer to our children.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That may sound contrary to what we ordinarily have thought about our children and how to relate to them and they to us, but it is built in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm arguing it's built into the biblical pattern of children obeying their parents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Once there is a new unit formed of parents and children, the parents of those parents assume a secondary role in the authority and leadership toward those children,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">which means that we should consult those parents and we should be willing to listen to them if they say that the gifts we are giving are proving to be unhelpful in the way they're trying to parent their kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I know this may be painful relationally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The older we are, the more humble we should be and the thicker our skin should be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We've been knocked about by life more times and we should have some calluses on our skin so that we don't mope and act immature and self-pitying because our kids have to tell us that our gifts aren't helping.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, back to the question she asked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">She wants to know what she should do towards grandparents, and I'm talking to grandparents and she didn't even ask me to talk to grandparents, but I felt like I needed to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So how do the parents of the grandchildren approach the grandparents if those grandparents are doing things or giving things that the parents find unhelpful?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's the first thing I would say, and it's kind of a general principle I would say about lots of relationships, marriage, friendships.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't try to give corrective advice to others, in this case to your parents, in the very moment of disagreement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, if it's Christmas or a birthday and the kids just opened the gift from grandmama and you find that gift really inappropriate, that's not the time to deal with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't deal with it then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The principle is find a neutral time at some distance from the moment of disagreement, perhaps over lunch, and gently ask if we can talk about something important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then be as affirming as you can to the motives and to the love that they're trying to express so that that doesn't feel minimized or discounted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then explain to them, to the best of your ability, why you think things should be different than they are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it would be helpful if you had thought through—I'm saying this as a granddad—it would be helpful if you had thought through some alternative suggestions for your parents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because we grandparents aren't always as wise and creative as we need to be in this regard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you can think of things that would bless your children from your parents, we would, I hope, be willing to hear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I can't end, Tony, without another word to grandparents because of that phrase, "Spoil your grandkids."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It is emphatically not our job to spoil our grandchildren.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's not funny. It's not funny.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not our place to be lenient where the parents are strict.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It is emphatically our role to reinforce with happy unity the parenting that our kids are trying to give their kids, our grandkids, assuming, of course, that it's safe and wholesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AgxWM1ipsU&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There should be a united front.
