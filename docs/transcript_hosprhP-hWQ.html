It's windows, doors, and your attic. Because oftentimes you'll find that there's not enough insulation in your attic. And so it's like you can have somebody come in just if it's blown in insulation, it's really easy to do that.</p><p>And it doesn't cost that much money. But windows and doors are like the biggest one. Check the air seals on the bottom of your door. A good friend of mine who's out in California, he moved into a new house, he sent me a picture of what it looked like under his door, and he had a gap that was like easily an inch from the bottom of the door to the floor.</p><p>And it was just sunlight just coming in. If you have gaps like that, just go to some like local store and just get some new gaskets that you can put on the bottom of your door, seals around it, and you'll be surprised how much of a difference that can make.</p></div></div></body></html>
