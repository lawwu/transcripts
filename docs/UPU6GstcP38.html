I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, episode 209.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm here at my Deep Work HQ, joined by my producer, Jesse. Before we get at all into today's episode,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a quick bit of house cleaning. Jesse and I want to hear from you about what's working with this show,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=43" target="_blank">00:00:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what's not, what you want to hear more of, what you want to hear less of. We're doing a version</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=49" target="_blank">00:00:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">2.0 we're planning for the podcast, just to tighten up what works and maybe batten down what's not. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">with that in mind, we created a quick online survey. Just go to the description of this podcast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">episode. There's a link, you click on it, answer a few questions. If you get a chance, it would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=64" target="_blank">00:01:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">very useful for us. It's a way to help influence the future of this show. So we're serious about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">improving. So go to the description, click on that survey link, answer a few questions, and you will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">have our great appreciation. I think Jesse, what I'm going to do is have two text boxes on there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">One will be complaints about Jesse, and it'll be like this really big box or whatever. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">there'll be complaints about Cal, and it'll be a really small box. And then when you click on it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">it'll be inactivated. Like it. Yeah, it'll just make me feel better. Sounds good. Forget the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">audience, forget the numbers. We know what this is all about, making Cal feel good. Speaking of good,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">we have a good episode. So what I'm doing here, Jesse, I'm theming both parts of the show today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have part one, part two, part one of the show, we're focusing on work, but in particular,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to focus on email. I have a collection of questions about email. So all in the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">theme, I will end part one with a habit tune up where I will be presenting a brand new piece of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">advice. It's something I began working on a little while ago. I've been testing it out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=137" target="_blank">00:02:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">bouncing it off people, but I've never publicly revealed it before. I would argue it is one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the single most effective things you could do to reduce the number of emails in your inbox.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">If you work in an organization with other people, one thing you could start doing tomorrow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that will greatly reduce the number of emails. I'm looking forward to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Then part two of the episode, we will get philosophical. I have a call on a collection</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of questions all about how do I live a more meaningful, deliberate, deep life? People</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">who are struggling with the question of being adrift, being unfocused and looking to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">a more steady and clear direction to what they're trying to do with their life. So upfront part one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">pragmatic email ending with a brand new piece of advice I'm excited about part two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We get philosophical. Now, before we get into those two parts, though, I'd like to start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the shows when possible, reacting to what's going on in the news. In particular, I have an article</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to talk about that we didn't really get around to talking on the last episode,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">but we should have because it's by me. So when I publish new things, especially new things in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the New Yorker, I like to try to discuss them on the show in a little bit more depth, let you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">what I'm thinking, maybe give you some more angles on it. So a couple of weeks ago, I published my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">latest for the New Yorker. It's titled Tick Tock and the Fall of the Social Media Giants. If you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">are watching this episode instead of just listening. So if you're at YouTube dot com slash</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Cal Newport Media, you'll see the article on your screen as well. Now, why I thought it was important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to talk about this topic is not that I haven't talked about it before on the show, but because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of the opposite of that, I've talked about this topic a lot on the show. That's kind of what makes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this cool for us. This is one of the first instances, I would say, of an idea whose birth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">was this podcast. I began bouncing these ideas around here with you, my listeners, and it evolved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">into a more polished form, the New Yorker. So here we are. Deep Questions podcast impacting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the world of news. So you've heard these ideas before, but they're a lot more polished now. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">let's go through it quickly. So I begin the article quoting Blake Chanley, Tick Tock's president of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Global Business Solutions, talking about competition from Facebook. This is where he said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">look, we're not worried. Facebook is a social platform built on a social graph. Tick Tock is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">an entertainment platform. These are two different things. Zuckerberg needs to stay in his lane. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">have our own lane. That name should sound familiar. Blake Chanley, I talked about him on the show,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">because I discovered this interview from one of you, my listeners, sent it to me at my interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">account, Newport.com email address. So then I went deeper into this. So here's the next point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to make. So in the article, I make this point that Facebook is trying to shift to be more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like Tick Tock. Instagram, owned by the same company, shifting to be more like Tick Tock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And the way they are doing this is by moving towards video, moving towards short video,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">but most importantly, as I'll soon elaborate, moving towards recommendations that have nothing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to do with the social graph, moving towards feeds that are generated purely by algorithms,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">not by who you follow, not by people you know, sharing it. So here's the quote from the article.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">"This shift is not surprising given Tick Tock's phenomenal popularity, and it has been very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">successful, but it's also short-sighted." So the whole thesis of the article is the following.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I say, "Platforms like Facebook could be doomed if they fail to maintain the social graphs upon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">which they built their kingdoms." So this is the setup to this whole article. Tick Tock's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">really popular. Companies like, platforms like Facebook, I should say, are trying to be more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Tick Tock-like to stave off the competition and try to have faster user growth. This could,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">however, doom them. All right, so let me elaborate this argument. What I'm getting at in this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the original take on this point is there's real advantages to having an online company</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">like Facebook or Instagram, or as you'll see, Twitter, that relies on a social graph.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=411" target="_blank">00:06:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And to be clear, by social graph, I mean all of these individual friend requests,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">all these individual follow clicks, this topology of connections that human users built up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">click by click, decision by decision, over months and months and years and years of use,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">these really rich networks. These give a real advantage to the early mover platforms who have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">built them up. One is a network effect advantage. So I'm highlighting these here. So I mentioned,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">for example, once Facebook had 100 million followers, active users, I should say, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it got by 2006, it became hard for anyone else to compete on a model of the people you know are here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">as you can see what the people you know are up to. Once you have 100 million users on one platform,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">how do you start from scratch and say, "Well, we only have 10,000, but we're growing."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a huge network effect advantage. There are also other advantages to these topologies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I talk a little bit in this article about the introduction of the retweet button to Twitter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I think people don't understand the degree to which the introduction of the retweet button</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">not only made Twitter into a lasting company of cultural influence, but also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">really transformed social media. So here's what happened when they introduced the retweet button.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">The friction required to send a link or tweet to your entire follower base went down to almost</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">nothing. Before we had the retweet button, people in Twitter would have to copy tweets and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">would put RT. So you remember this, if you're old enough, you would put RT in caps colon,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you would quote, just copy and paste quote to tweet that you're retweeting. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you would put at the original person who retweeted it below it.

That reduction in friction made all of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">difference. It unlocked what I call a fierce viral dynamic. So now a tweet that was catching the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">attention of the zeitgeist in the right way could spread through the power law topology</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of the Twitter social graph at frightening speed. Tens of millions, hundreds of millions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of people could see something within an hour or two. And this all was based off these individual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">user decisions to retweet or not retweet. They see it from a few people, they retweet it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">This turned out to have two hugely powerful effects. One, it attracted more interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">people to platforms like Twitter, because there's potential here.

So now more interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">people came to Twitter. That's another big network effect advantage. If all of the interesting people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">are on Twitter, when a competitor came along like Parler or Gab, they didn't do as well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">because there wasn't as many interesting people on there saying interesting things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Perhaps more important, these fierce viral dynamics also gave way to a frighteningly effective</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">distributed curation mechanism. So what happened is all these individual decisions to tweet and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">retweet created this human powered curation algorithm that was really, really good at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">figuring out what's the most interesting, controversial, outrageous, funny, off the wall,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but perfect meme, whatever it was.

So that was very effective. So suddenly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Twitter not only had interesting people on there, but it had this really good human powered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">curation, distributed curation algorithm that meant when you went on Twitter, you were going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to see interesting things or funny things or outrageous things. And again, this is not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">sophisticated machine learning algorithms at play here.

That's very powerful. So then as I get into it, Facebook</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">noticed this retweet thing is working. So then by 2012, we get a share button added to the mobile</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">app of Facebook. It's exactly retweet. They too wanted to take advantage of that distributed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">curation. All right, so here's my summary. Both Facebook and Twitter are built on the same general</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">model of leveraging hard to replicate large social graphs to generate a never ending stream of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">engaging content, a strategy that proved to be robust in the face of new competition and incredibly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">lucrative. So it's the social graphs and those three advantages I just summarized,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=678" target="_blank">00:11:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the people you know are on there, the interesting people are on there, and you have the distributed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">curation effect of the share and retweets. That made the small number of companies who got there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">first, Facebook, Instagram, Instagram, I took this out of the article, but I had a piece in there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">before about how Instagram basically, they were able to make a run at the castle that Facebook</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">was building, because Facebook didn't understand image.

So what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">going to happen? Well, here's the key. I think the key thing going on in social media, digital news</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is that tick-tock success. These developments put traditional social media companies like Facebook</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">in a perilous bind.

So people are going over to tick-tock and what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">happened?

So this is public companies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1067" target="_blank">00:17:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">there's huge investor pressure.

We can't lose this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">many users to tick-tock, which got to a billion users in just a couple of years. It's just really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">exploding. So they have to do something. So what are they doing? They're trying to be more like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">tick-tock, which may be in the short term makes sense.

So here's what I wrote. If companies like Facebook,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">so if they instead move away from their social graph foundations to concentrate on optimizing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">in the moment engagement, they'll enter a competitive landscape that pits them directly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1106" target="_blank">00:18:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">against the many other existing sources of mobile distraction, not just tick-tock, but also more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">bespoke and specialized social networks, streaming services, et cetera, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So as soon as you are offering entertainment that's not based on the social graph,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1120" target="_blank">00:18:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you are competing with every other source of entertainment and distraction on the phone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1124" target="_blank">00:18:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think that's a battle that Facebook or Instagram or Twitter can win long-term.

And that's my conclusion. This all points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to a possible future in which social media giants like Facebook may soon be past their long stretch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1149" target="_blank">00:19:09.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of dominance.

Now, last time I talked about this idea on this show,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">some of my listeners, some of you wrote back to me and said, "Oh, so you're saying like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">TikTok is better or like it's somehow we're in a better world if TikTok just dominates everything?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Isn't that just as bad?" So here's the key nuance, which by the way, based on your feedback</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1179" target="_blank">00:19:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">as listeners, I knew to really hit this point in my New Yorker piece. TikTok, of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is subject to the same pressures. So in this future, it too will eventually fade. So no,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1190" target="_blank">00:19:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I do not think TikTok is going to be some 20 year long cultural force.

Yeah. You got out with the doors. You got to have a source handy, by the way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1441" target="_blank">00:24:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">speaking of New Yorker and then we'll move on. But I read the, you told me about the article from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1445" target="_blank">00:24:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">last week, Ted Friends article about the door to door salesman. Oh yeah. I haven't finished that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1449" target="_blank">00:24:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. That's really good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So Jesse told me, I always, if people, people ask me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1454" target="_blank">00:24:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">how do I read, what's my New Yorker reading habits with the magazine? Um, because it's hard,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it's long and it comes every week. So here it is. So here's my New Yorker reading habits. So you can,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1463" target="_blank">00:24:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you can follow suit if you subscribe. So you get the daily email and that points out like what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1469" target="_blank">00:24:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">going on, what was posted on the web that day. What's interesting. So I would say 50% of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1475" target="_blank">00:24:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">daily emails will point out an article that I ended up reading on the web because they published</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1480" target="_blank">00:24:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like a new article every day on the web, uh, for the magazine. My rule is like, you always have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1484" target="_blank">00:24:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">read one. And if there's sometimes we'll read more than one, but you always have to read one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1489" target="_blank">00:24:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that forces you, even if it's a day where the five articles, none of them are right in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1493" target="_blank">00:24:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">sweet spot, you read about door to door salesman or something else. It's really interesting. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1496" target="_blank">00:24:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">so that's my role. Read the daily email to see what catches your attention. That's where a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1501" target="_blank">00:25:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of my stuff is featured. So definitely read that. And then you got to read one, one per week,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1505" target="_blank">00:25:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">at least I have a similar rule to look at the table of contents and then circle two. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1512" target="_blank">00:25:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">if there's two, I like, then I read them. And then it breaks the seal and then you end up reading</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1516" target="_blank">00:25:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">more a lot of times, but like, you always have to read at least one. Oh, and then the third rule</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1520" target="_blank">00:25:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">is you have to leave the magazine out kind of prominently in your house or apartment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And like, Oh, when people come over, Oh, sorry, let me just clean this up over here. I just was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1529" target="_blank">00:25:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you got to put it next to your copy of the Harper's in the Paris.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1533" target="_blank">00:25:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You recycle them a lot quickly thereafter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1536" target="_blank">00:25:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. It was just when the pile grows, I suppose. All right. So anyways, as mentioned, two parts to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1542" target="_blank">00:25:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the show, the follow part one, email part two, a bunch of questions about living the deep life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1548" target="_blank">00:25:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Before we get to that first part though, let me talk briefly about a brand new sponsor of this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1556" target="_blank">00:25:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">show, which is 80,000 hours. Where's that come from? Where's that number come from? Well, if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1565" target="_blank">00:26:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">do the math, you have roughly 80,000 hours in your career. So that's 40 hours a week,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1570" target="_blank">00:26:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">50 weeks a year for 40 years, you have about 80,000 hours to work in your career.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So that adds up.

So you sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3493" target="_blank">00:58:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">spend 10 hours working on things, you get 10 hours worth of reward, but that's not actually how it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3498" target="_blank">00:58:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">works. It, it, it tends to be more non-linear. So if you spend a lot of time on one thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3503" target="_blank">00:58:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the reward you begin to get for that time takes off and gets bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3509" target="_blank">00:58:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So you kind of have these moments, these discontinuities where the, the, the rewards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3512" target="_blank">00:58:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you get after you've really focused on something for a while really jumps up that reward curve</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3516" target="_blank">00:58:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">really jumps up. So the reality of this is it is not the same to take a set pool of hours</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3524" target="_blank">00:58:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and split it among multiple things, or put all that time on the one thing. You do not end up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3529" target="_blank">00:58:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">with the same reward in the end. If this function was simply linear, then spending one hour on 10</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3536" target="_blank">00:58:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">separate projects would give you the same reward as 10 hours on one project. So you might as well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3540" target="_blank">00:59:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">do the 10 separate projects because it's interesting.

Now that's scary because you're thinking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3562" target="_blank">00:59:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">well, these things are important to me. There's different aspects of my life. There's different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3566" target="_blank">00:59:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">options I want to pursue. I can't just stop everything. So I'm going to give you a two-step</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3570" target="_blank">00:59:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">process here. One, I do think you need to simplify, especially in that world of hobbies, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3576" target="_blank">00:59:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Like this is what you're going for in your professional life. And maybe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3580" target="_blank">00:59:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">outside of your professional life, you cut this down to a two things, maybe three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3586" target="_blank">00:59:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Next, you want to have one point of major focus that is getting most of your time and everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3592" target="_blank">00:59:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">else you want to baseline.

And most of your time is on one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3602" target="_blank">01:00:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">thing. So like professionally, maybe most of that time is going into the new website, though I might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3610" target="_blank">01:00:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">recommend that sounds like this UX, you need a job, right?

So like if UX is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3614" target="_blank">01:00:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be your career, that might be the thing you're really putting your time into. And you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3617" target="_blank">01:00:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">just baselining the website.

You might, again, with your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3624" target="_blank">01:00:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">hobbies have something similar. You have a background fitness routines. You stay in shape</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3629" target="_blank">01:00:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">for various action sports you're interested in, but you're not doing any training for those sports.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3632" target="_blank">01:00:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And all of your hobby time is going into guitar. So like you baseline almost everything and a very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3638" target="_blank">01:00:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">small number of things you put time into, because again, you put enough time into something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3642" target="_blank">01:00:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's when you get these discontinuity, these discontinuities, these big jumps in the rewards you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3645" target="_blank">01:00:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">get. And then once you focus on something for a while, and have had a big jump in reward,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3650" target="_blank">01:00:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">then you can turn your attention to something else and do something similar for the next six</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3654" target="_blank">01:00:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">months, next year, the next two years, whatever it takes.

What I'm saying here is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3672" target="_blank">01:01:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty similar to my deep life buckets, Keystone habit type advice, we'll get to that in a second</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3677" target="_blank">01:01:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that sort of more, I would say more philosophical thinking, which covers not just work, but your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPU6GstcP38&t=3683" target="_blank">01:01:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">whole life, we'll get into that more in a future question.
