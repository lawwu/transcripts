class='max-width'><p>congressman how should we refer to you today well i prefer dean but you know let's go let's go with that mr phillips and just i'm i'm asking people to be keen on dean so i might as well run with it well you know what i'm a big supporter of the dean machine already oh you know about the dean machine with this gelato i'm all up on the dean machine by the way i bought an old international harvester metro van for 20s when we did activations like south by southwest and i used to own one of those by the way no you did yeah i bought it for my ranch come on i love that baby so i bought one for talenti and i saw how people just immediately were attracted to it and fell in love with it and i thought hey when i ran for congress i'm going to do the same thing so i created the government repair truck are you driving around in this international harvester of course you're kidding yeah i'll show you i'll send you a picture of it it's cool it's awesome it's got a 1980 chevy chassis under it but it's still the still the basic uh nuts and bolts we're referring to a type of uh automobile you can ask one of your three drivers about it david dory david your driver can take you in it ask your miami driver he probably owns some muscle cars i don't think your la driver owns muscle cars here we go let's start the show three two let your winners ride rain man david sacks hey everybody hey everybody welcome to the all in podcast with us again today the dictator himself chamath palihapitiya the rain man david sacks and the sultan of science david friedberg we are going to continue our conversation series with presidential candidates today our fourth presidential candidate is on the program dean phillips represents minnesota's third district and he's about 25 years younger than trump and biden at 54 years old dean before getting into politics i understand you were the ceo of your family's spirits business and you ran talenti gelato oh that pistachio flavor amazing so welcome to the all in podcast meet the other besties and maybe you could just start out by telling us why you are running for president yeah well i'll tell you after being in the vodka business and the ice cream business and actually the coffee business i think i understand at least what americans want so that's a good start uh well i'll tell you a little about my background why i'm here i lost my dad in the vietnam war when i was just six months old i had grew up with no money in st paul minnesota i earned an rotc scholarship on behalf of the federal government of course to pursue his education i went to vietnam in 1968 just before i was born i got to see the u.s land on the moon and i think regularly about how he looked up two days before his helicopter crashed and he died looked up and saw americans on the moon and looked down and saw america at its worst and literally that experience in no small way is what brings me to this day and i was six months old my mom was 24 and widowed and we moved in with my great grandparents for the first three years of my life and i got lucky when i was three my mom married a wonderful extraordinary man who adopted me eddie phillips brought me into a family of great blessings my grandmother became dear abby and my aunt ann landers so i grew up in a family of a lot of advice and i've lived on both sides of the advantage and i recognize it i remember the day i turned 26 and i counted the days that my father had lived my birth father and i remember the day after i had lived as many days as him my life changed forever and i i became inspired joined our family business after college i ended up running our beverage business we created belvedere vodka which we sold to lvmh and then got into the ice cream business and did the same thing you guys created belvedere yeah we my father and i and our partner steve gill went on a trip to poland in 1993 hoping to sell them phillips schnapps which we made in minnesota we thought eastern europe was ready for peppermint and peach shops and and we we're touring distilleries and we see both in in duty free in the airport and in the distilleries the most beautiful packaging we had ever seen in the spirits business now mind you this is when absolute and stoli were like the pinnacle of luxury right fifteen dollars dollar you know average now and my father immediately yeah sat at a restaurant that night literally this is a literal napkin story he on a napkin created a little matrix and said if stoli and absolute are fifteen dollars and they're the most premium in a fast-growing category why shouldn't there be a 25 vodka and why should this not be it so we negotiated with the polish government our partner tad dorda from poland helped us and we first obtained the distribution rights and then when poland privatized their spirits industry we acquired the distillery and the ip and the rest was history and you know cork finish beautiful bottle we sold it we talked about the lowest common denominator the pens we used to write the orders the way we carried it made all the difference in the world and then we used that same template in ice cream because what we found is in every category of every consumer product category in which there are two main competitors coke and pepsi stoli absolute ben and jerry's and haagen-dazs they tend to fight to the bottom of the ice cream line and they're not going to win the bottom lower pricing um you know frankly um demeaning consumers and there's always an opportunity to introduce something a little bit more premium a little bit more special that's still an affordable luxury and belvedere by the way was built by jay-z i can tell you that story if you want to hear it it's an extraordinary one yeah yeah tell that story yeah yeah so so so far you're like you're our kind of candidate we're like exactly yeah you just got four votes apparently we're all looking at you like who is this guy this is awesome yeah so when people ask me about my platform i'll say i'll be a storyteller about vodka i'm ready to start popping bottles over here by the way that's exactly what jay-z did sax and i popped many a belvedere bottle in when we had our run in l.a true or not true sex it was a tough choice between belvedere and gray goose oh i'll tell you that story too by the way anyway so we introduced belvedere and it and by the way what we learned in hindsight is that our aperture was way too small you know we were way too we we sold it by the bottle not by the case we only went to restaurants and bars and we sold it to the bars at first not to the big stores we wanted to be special and we completely underestimated the size of what this category could be sydney frank who introduced gray goose took a much bigger approach anyway so i'm sitting at home getting ready for work one day i have mtv on and it's probably a year after we introduced belvedere it's doing well but not not big so sorry this is like mid 90s yeah i can't remember the year chamath it's probably you know 95 yeah yeah 90 thereabouts i'm watching mtv i see a jay-z video and i'm like oh my god i'm gonna watch that video and it is all belvedere it's in the fridge he's holding it there are people dancing he's pouring it on him and i froze called my dad immediately who of course didn't have mtv on and and i said you got to turn it on he couldn't find the channel i'm like hey dad you know mtv repeats the same videos you know five ten times a day so we got to the office and sure enough we had the tv on it came back on the whole company gathered at that time we were probably 10 people and we gathered around the tv and watched this video and i'm telling you guys within two weeks the brand completely popped and my dad jay-z ended up calling my father they had a dinner in new york city uh a memorable one for both actually he ended up introducing a vodka some years later called armadale uh right and it failed miserably but it was one of the first times that i think in this new culture of influencers and celebrity endorsers that that magic happened he almost literally made belvedere so that's the story did you guys sign him to a deal and pay him money or no no in fact we talked about that and the core so this is the brand foundation of the brand house was authenticity we didn't do a damn thing that had anything to do with anything that wasn't true the makers of it the product itself we didn't we didn't pay people to talk about it unlike sydney frank with gray goose so we chose not to it was all natural and then here's the other cool thing and this is how my campaign is going to work we sent 200 bottles in very special beautiful boxes to 200 influencers we we believe that if we could simply seed the brand with 200 people all around the us that they could be the content makers and the advocates the ambassadors in fact one of them went to this guy right behind me bill clinton and robert de niro another example robert redford you know leaders of industry and actors and and uh and the like robert de niro gets one of these things and there's a note inside with a picture of the distiller bogdan zedlensky it said watch page three the tiffany section i'm sorry the tiffany location of the wall street journal on call it it was like monday february 6th to only 200 people knew what was coming the ad in the paper didn't show a bottle of anything it just said belvedere bogdan wants to know how you like it so we literally did an ad that cost gosh knows back then probably a hundred thousand dollars tiny little top corner ad that spoke to 200 people in the united states of america that had no idea nobody else knew what it was robert de niro goes to the beverly hills hotel or the peninsula i can't remember ordered a bottle of water and he orders a belvedere martini soon thereafter the barman says mr de niro we have absolute we have stoli i don't have that brand and he says i don't think you heard me i want a belvedere martini so the barman sends like the bar back to whatever the the wine and spirit shop is on rodeo driver in beverly hills and the guy he comes back with a bottle and the entire bar watched this little episode and i'm telling you once again within a week that store was selling through belvedere like it was water so these little moments where you identify the right people and now mind you this is in the analog era there was no internet there was no social media this was people simply talking to people so we sold belvedere to lvmh and then we looked at the ice cream category ben and jerry's doing the same thing if you can tell us about that what is it like to negotiate against lvmh and bernard arnaud and why do you sell it when it's working i guess maybe it's a question you know i'll tell you well this is not a story i've shared with many they were very disingenuous and uh it it deeply troubles me to this day uh the way that my father was treated the promises that were made simply to get a deal done and then not kept i think is a reflection on principle and i'll leave it at that a lesson learned in fact rather than going through a competitive process which i think any enterprise would do to maximize value of a brand our family ethos was a little different and and i think we bit and in hindsight it was a mistake but i'll leave it at that you learn less you know what you learn lessons every experience to this very day i'm learning them every day on the campaign trail too that was one i would never make again all right well you got the two david's votes with the vodka you got mine with the gelato and if you launch a luxury fabric brand or sweaters i think you're going to get your mom first i got some other work to do for eight years so we'll do that afterwards i'll just wrap this long story up so we introduced you know talenti obviously does well we sold it to unilever then i opened a couple coffee shops with my family in minneapolis thank you so much for joining me today and i'm going to be a little bit more of a fun guy i'm thinking this would be kind of a fun folly and then we're watching the 2016 election uh at home uh i thought it would wake up the next morning we'd have hillary clinton as president not that that was thrilling to the world but it would have been safe and lo and behold you know what happened and i remember telling my family that night like look give the guy a chance he's not going to act like that in the white house the presidency changes you it humbles you it moderates you and my family thought i was a you know i was a joke and i woke up the next morning my 16 year old was in her room crying my 18 year old was a freshman at college we facetimed her and she's crying and i sat at the breakfast table guys and i promised my daughters i would do something i raised them to be participants not not observers and i looked around at my district i thought maybe i'll run for congress i looked around and uh i hadn't the district had not been won by a democrat since the 1958 election this is now we're looking at the 2018 election 60 years and i'm going to be a part of the election and i'm going to be a part of the election and the man who had won won his fourth term by 14 points and people told me i was crazy you know you're out of your mind you're giving up a good life to run for misery and you'll never make it and you'll embarrass yourself which is why i did it and not only did we win we won by 12 points we had fun we used invitation not confrontation and i drove that little van all around the district to the most unhospitable parts i opened the service window i served coffee and i sat i put two chairs out and people would just come up and talk and i found me and my wife and my wife and my wife magic in just letting people share what's on their mind they're so unheard anyhow i get to well i can tell you now i want to tell you why i'm doing it but that's the story of where i came from and why i'm doing this and look at the end of the day i'm the one of those that got lucky you know there's a lot of kids who lost their dads in vietnam who did not have the magical moment that i had to be adopted by an amazing father and that was the difference for me it's my job to make sure others get that same chance simple as that before we jump into the future about why you're running and what you what you see for the country talk about the years that you spent in congress what did you observe there what what is it like day to day and what do you think is working and what isn't working i wish we had three hours i get there chamath i get there the first week of 2019 and like all of you that come from organizational enterprise experience i assume that nancy pelosi and kevin mccarthy would have a have a strategy to introduce the new members of congress both democrats and republicans you know get to know each other do a ropes course you know and build some trust or something and my goodness it was just the opposite guys we were put on separate buses going to different events and i realized right away that they had a systemic segregation strategy on day one and you know what i mean sincerely the two parties this is i'll tell you what i've learned we've talked more about this the only people that want to protect the status quo of the duopoly and the political industrial complex that just surrounds it all are the two parties the two parties are the two parties the two parties are the two parties and it is destructive and i will get into that but i recognize right away all of my colleagues that the leadership in both uh democratic and republican side they wanted to keep us separate they did not want to give us education and information and they wanted to keep us so busy that we could not become threats to their power structure you can imagine members of congress tend to be pretty ambitious people and ultimately they were smart to do that because they made members of congress they do this to stay raise raise money all week long 10 000 hours per week is what senators and house members spend raising money i've got a bill actually that would preclude it from 8 a.m to 5 p.m because it's such an unmitigated joke and disaster the fact that in the united states that a pack representing a special interest or corporation can hand a five thousand dollar check to a member of congress at a steakhouse on wednesday evening and then that member serves on a committee in which that's a business or special interest has business in front of the next day is the most unbelievable form of legal corruption you could possibly imagine so that's one needless to say i resolved right after that first week of orientation that i would do it differently i befriended my republican colleagues my wife annalise and i started having bipartisan dinners at our house i joined the problem solvers caucus i hope you guys know about it it's the most important small caucus in congress we're now 32 democrats and 32 republicans committed to doing what we're supposed to do get to know each other talk policy and try to make a difference now we're the work horses not the show horses so you don't know most of our names including me but we were the ones invited to the white house uh in like week three of our service i was one of four democrats there were four republicans that president trump invited to the situation room to make a proposition to get us through the shutdown which i can talk about that bizarre hour of my life as well um and that's how i resolved to do it now i'm ranked depending on the the survey number one number two number ten uh most bipartisan members of the entire u.s congress and including governors uh and and i vote relatively progressive it's not about just the votes it's about the ethos it's about uh republican sponsored bills that come from me it's about me sponsoring republican-led bills uh and that's what makes me a little bit different than i think just about every member of congress not to mention i think i'm the only one that's willing to torpedo a career so that the country isn't torpedoed by this nonsense and dysfunction um there's a lot more to talk about but the it all starts with a systematic segregation and a focus on fighting each other instead of fighting for each other i can talk about it all day long let's start there dean what give us the assessment of what's happening in the white house right now before we talk about your candidacy just like what's going on well let me just say i respect president biden i he's a man i've had in my house uh for an event he's a man with whom i've flown on air force one or two times he did a beautiful video for my daughter he called my mother um i think he did a fine job i think he was the only man that could have defeated donald trump in 2020 and i have to say i think it's fair to say too he's probably the only democrat who could and will lose to donald trump in 2024. he's a human being he's now in his 80s he is clearly on the decline he's not incompetent i believe he's surrounded himself by competent able principled people who are able to do what he wants to do and i believe the white house is running as a team as most do but do i think that he will be in a position to continue leading this country in the future i do not i think i'm joined by about 75 percent in the country of the country in saying that i also believe the policies that we passed for the most part are investments for the future in infrastructure the chips act i think is a very important bill which by the way has national security implications as you guys know the inflation reduction act a bizarre name for a bill that's really a energy and climate bill i think is is pretty good legislation and i think he reconstituted our allies around the world that had been frayed to a point of great danger during the trump administration so i salute the past but this is really an election about the future it's about a generational change it's about creating you know really a new american century that will be powered by systems structures people technologies that i'm just afraid that president biden and former president trump can't even comprehend let alone create thoughtful policies that will be able to create thoughtful policies to both nurture and also manage and i think that's where we're at and i want to i think we have wars overseas that i think in no small part are caused by a generation that is so focused on techniques and tools of the past that they can't even dare look to building peace for the future that's i think why we have the middle east still going that's why ukraine you know the vice president has some ownership in some of these issues that i'm afraid um have to be exposed and they're the truth and i'm happy to talk about them but most of all i'll wrap it with this affordability in the united states of america is absolutely the most challenging issue facing americans they don't believe that their government is listening they don't believe the president understands they don't believe congress is able to do anything about it because we're so dysfunctional and that's another mission that i'm on right now to end this nonsense i am going to build a team of rivals i will have a white house and a cabinet comprised of both democrats and republicans the most able leaders imaginable who have run multi-billion dollar organizations in some cases understand customer service will employ zero-based budgeting to the extent we can we will employ a world-class consulting firm to look at every single government program system structure and and personnel to identify ways to save money these are things that this president and frankly no president who doesn't have business experience non-profit leadership experience and government experience could possibly imagine because they're so stuck in their silos ways of thinking he's been there for 50 years and it's time for change i was two three years old when he became a senator so let's get specific on the issues and go into foreign policy which is david saxe's i think number one issue this election but first just to be clear on biden do you believe he's in cognitive decline do the democrats privately believe he's in cognitive decline and to what extent do you think he'd make it through the next presidency or do you think this is sort of a ronald reagan situation where he might look back on it and he's got some early onset of some cognitive decline what do you personally think and what do democrats think i don't want to impress upon anybody or give you the sense that i think he has a form of dementia or alzheimer's or significant cognitive decline but anybody who pays attention can see the change and i'm not i'm not you know people are saying that i'm causing his problems i could risk his you know re-election you know i'm not the guy that has him losing to trump nationally down in 5 of 6 battleground states the lowest approval ratings in presidential history almost and i'm certainly not the guy that has shown his you know his decline that's on video that's on audio you see it it's natural he's a human being for goodness sakes all i'm doing you guys is saying the quiet part out loud the only one you ask the question do others talk about this the question is is anybody not talking about this of course they are you guys they've really created an opportunity for you because like you said everyone's talking about this of course but no one's willing to say it of course what has been the blowback in the democratic party from your declaring what do you think i'm not being thrown flowers and parties let me tell you that guys i'll tell you i i i i think most would consider me an affable friendly well-liked member of congress i know that that's my that's my ethos my friends are still my friends i think they're disappointed because this is not what you do when you're a member of a party you follow the rules you follow the rules in line you shush up you sit down you get in line and you do nothing to upset the apple cart of others who've been waiting in line perhaps a little longer than you so you can imagine the pushback has been strong the arrow is sharp and the pain quite significant but nothing compared to the pain that americans are feeling right now and that's why i'm doing this and i should also let you know i had no intention of doing this a year ago i was on a radio show and a host asked me if i thought the president should run again and i said of course not he is not running again i'm implicitly if not explicitly said he would be a transitional president kind of the bridge most members of congress thought he was going to stand down that's why that's why newsom and pritzker and whitmer and so many others were kind of making their plans and i said and if he doesn't pass the torch then we should ensure that least that the stage has newer generation candidates to give voters a choice anyway months went by i started seeing the polls change dramatically the tenor and tone of constituent discussions with me and every single one of my colleagues was changing graphically all the independents moderate republicans that voted for the president i think for the right reasons were increasingly telling us that they're not going to do it again they may not vote for trump but they're not going to vote rather than vote for biden and over time it got to a point actually guys where i resigned from the house leadership table because my position was so incongruent with those who were in positions to do something about it that i didn't feel it was appropriate for me to sit with them anymore and i was really frustrated i called gretchen whitmer i called jb pritzker i made public calls to the candidates whose names are better known than me to jump in you know the water's warm you guys it's a democratic primary that's what we do not only did those two not take my calls which they would have any other day they had their political operatives take those calls and they told me please don't use their names that's the culture that's the culture you guys that we're dealing with you will be blackballed you will be disenfranchised you will be let out the door if you so much as even issue a word that you might challenge a sitting president of the united states this is the united states of america it's appalling anyhow i'm frustrated we saw that happen with rfk jr because he declared initially as a democrat and biden wouldn't give him secret service protection despite the you know enormous personal safety risks and threats he's actually saying the same thing for me by the way guys you can imagine yeah and biggest line item in my budget right now by the way is security the biggest line item the second biggest line item that's going to surpass that is getting onto the ballot right well that was the thing is they wouldn't let they wouldn't let rfk on the ballot they wouldn't debate him they just want to pretend like he didn't exist and they basically drove him out of the party so now he's running as an independent do you think you're gonna be able to get on the ballot as a democrat on in these primaries absolutely and we're making those choices right now david because first of all it's obscene i want to let you all know that in a country that prides itself on being a democracy a democratic republic i can't even tell you how many states literally create high barriers to entry to satisfy the two parties to ensure that their coronated candidate has an advantage over anybody else i'm talking about the most egregious ones give us an example of what you have to do oh the most egregious are oftentimes the deepest blue new york is is close to impossible when i say impossible so explain it to us like what you have to do so the reason i started in new hampshire is it has a 103 year old tradition of being the first in the nation primary they take this really seriously they're the most engaged americans in the country they have a process they you know we walk through the snow we answer their questions and you also all you need is a thousand dollar check you got to be 35 years old you got to be born in the united states of america and you're going to be a president of the united states of america and you too can become a candidate for president of the united states that's what i did they have the most beautiful ritual in the state house in concord new hampshire that is worth going to one time just to see the majesty of filing for president of the united states so there are 21 of us on the democratic side of the ballot because that's how it should be take take a state like virginia wait hold on there's 21 people running for the democratic but that's incredible i had no idea yeah 21 uh marianne williamson and i are the best known of those 21 because the president of the united states chose not to so that's how you have it you ask about other states though new york virginia uh 450 to 500 000 to pay consulting firms to pay people 25 26 dollars per signature to just sit outside and just say hey can we get your signature to get this guy on a ballot no it's not grassroots it's not old school caucusing democracy it is pay to play and we would we would need it we would need a well we're going to have to raise uh probably six yeah maybe i'm sorry maybe maybe maybe less than that maybe five million dollars we have a staff of three people right now and legal counsel just to get my name on a primary ballot it's absurd marianne williamson you know she's not going to be able to rfk as a as an independent by the way i think he should be i i'm not someone who i'm concerned about some of his positions but i think he should be able to get on the ballot it's you guys it's absurd it's obnoxious and what i've discovered in the last three weeks is going to be my mission after being president to fix because it is going to destroy the country from the inside and that is why we have the kind of candidates we have year after year after year and americans say they're that's why we have trumpism i like the fact that you know most people become politicians as a career i've harped against this for a while and so they have everything to lose if they stand up against the party and they stand up against the political establishment within which they're meant to operate and therefore just a few people get to make all the decisions and control all the levers and everyone else is just a marionette but and they stay there forever dave they stay there forever and there's no term limits which is what we need that's why we need them the fact that you're self-made and you don't have anything to lose you can leave congress and you'll be fine you you're a citizen that can go back to work and do what you do and you're doing this as a service you're doing this because of your interest in the country it sounds like not to say that other folks don't but they're largely going to be driven and unfortunately adversely affected by the fact that they have to fall within the way that the game is played in order to operate and will not stand up and say the things that need to be said in order for us to make progress and get out of these situations but those are the perverse incentives i commend you for doing it i'm glad it's possible i think jason we should probably talk about the topic we have two topics that i think we're all passionate here the first is foreign policy the second is the budget and our out of control spending let's start with sax you said you wanted hard questions welcome to the pot let's bring it before we came on you both said hard questions let's go please meet david sachs hey david dean you said a minute ago that one of the reasons why the world's on fire is because of the bind administration's handling of foreign policies kind of led us to this point i think there was a really good example of this a week ago there was a new report out by a former u.n assistant secretary general named michael von der schulenberg who worked at the u.n for 34 years he did a detailed study and reconstruction of what happened in march of 2022 so the month after the war and what he concluded is there was a bona fide deal on this and he said that the u.s government is not going to be able to do that because the u.s government is not going to be able to do that because the u.s government is not going to be able to do that because the u.s government is not going to be able to do that because the u.s government is not going deal on the table between Russia and Ukraine where Putin was willing to pull back and leave and leave the territorial integrity of Ukraine intact if Ukraine would agree not to become part of NATO and this is something that's been discussed um there's been many reports of this over the last several months Ukrainian Pravda had a story about that but now there's yet another confirmation that such a deal was available and yet Boris Johnson and Joe Biden said no we want to pressure Putin not work out a peace deal with him and so thanks to western intervention that deal never happened now we're 20 months later and the Ukrainian counter-offensive has failed it's been a fiasco the casualties have been absolutely massive horrifying you saw there was this article on time magazine this new profile of Zelensky where his own aides and advisors say that he's delusional he can't accept that they're losing the war they furthermore say that even if the U.S. provides more weapons more aid they don't have enough men they have enough soldiers to use them things are going that badly I think there's now a fear that Ukraine could collapse in the next year even if we provide more aid so I guess you know I know that early on in the war you supported Biden's policy I'm wondering have events on the ground now change your view at all how do you feel about it today do you think it was a mistake not to try and work out a peace deal in those early months of the war and if you were president what would you try and do differently now to try and end this thing well first of all I think we have to back up to 2014 to talk about this David um you know first of all I I've seen that reporting I I do not have confirmation of the validity of that uh and and and if I did I could talk about it more directly but if that's the truth uh I would first ask did that include Crimea and secondly it is not this it's not a United States decision about whether or not Ukraine should agree to a peace deal it is uh a strange decision plain and simple but I I do want to turn back the clock a little bit because I think this all kind of plays together but by the way it didn't it didn't include Crimea but Zelensky was willing to go for that deal and it was the west who intervened and said no we want you to pressure Putin and fight David like I said you know I I never speak unless I can verify that myself and I've not seen that intelligence in the skiff I've not seen that presented to me if and by the way there are some times where I don't know most times none of us know everything if that is the case I would absolutely support it and I think that's a good point I think that's a good point absolutely answer this question differently but based on what I do know uh I want to turn back the clock to 2014. you know this is where foreign policy matters you know President Obama was a great orator I think a inspirational leader you know he came to the U.S. presidency with only organizing state legislative and a couple or few years of senate experience as a very young man and Joe Biden was his vice president and when Vladimir Putin took Crimea uh easily you know that set the tone for what's going on right now and we have not done a very good job of prevention that's true in health care that is true in poverty that is true in our foreign policy which is by the way maybe what happens when you spend 83 billion a year on diplomacy and 850 billion a year on bombs and missiles not to mention go back to Eisenhower in the military industrial complex David now you well know this it does it controls a lot of our policy because it's a very good job of preventing the spread of the virus and it's a very good job of preventing the spread of the virus and it's a very good job of preventing the spread of the virus because those who are making great profit find ways to influence those who open the piggy banks I think the Crimea moment in 2014 the writing was on the wall that was Putin's test if I take an inch well maybe they'll give me a mile and what happened during the Biden presidency of course he took the mile I think it has implications now though David and all of you you know if we do not do our best to support Ukraine and defending I think it doesn't just send a message to Putin a post-Putin Russia which is going to be a failure of the world and the world is going to be a failed nation with a brain drain and something we should talk about but also sends a message to Iran North Korea and even China when I want to talk about that too because I think we have a much brighter future with them than most people portray as it relates to Taiwan and that's the sad truth as we get ourselves into these situations that then layer up the consequences by withdrawing and Afghanistan was another example of that so to answer your question had there been a peace deal at that point that simply would have and the deal would have been back in return for not uh entering nato who in their right mind would say that was a bad deal who in their right mind especially boris johnson well well by the way it's a lot earlier when you get people like well i'm going to make this case as you guys know for comprehensive new generation of leaders all around the world in our country and in others that are sick of this nonsense sick of the bloodshed sick of enriching enterprise at the expense of human beings it happens here it happens in ukraine and russia and it's happening in the middle east plain and simple. Sachs, anything else on foreign policy you want to go to? Packing off now would be, I think, a shameful, horrible mistake. The one thing I would argue right now, David, is those who are most likely going to be subject to Putin's terror, the countries in Europe, should be carrying a much bigger part of this load. We have 750 bases and installations around the world. In 80 countries, we are the most dominant presence in world history of any government. And we spend more on our military than the next, I think, 11 nations combined, for gosh sakes. And if anyone thinks that a kinetic risk to the United States is the most likely harm that will be done us, not cyber or not social or not biological, I think you're out of your mind. Those are the risks that I think are most threatening, that I think this president does not quite understand. And we have to recomprise and recommit. And I think that's the most important risk that we have to take. And I think that's the most important risk that we have to take. And I think that's the most important risk that we have to take.

And I think that's the most important risk that we have to take. And I think that's the most important risk that we have to take. And I think that's the most important risk that we have to take. I'll make this really simple. If we want to change our constitution and change what we consider speech, change how the federal government or any domestic government affects people's rights to what they watch, what they read, what they eat, how they pray, how they think, where they go, with whom they congregate, you know what, that's up to Americans. But I think to target one app is a huge mistake. And I have a very simple solution. Hold every single platform to the same standard, transparency via their algorithm, have an independent commission perhaps that is charged and responsible with assessing and holding those platforms to account. And if any of them violate the terms that we pass into law, then they should be banned. But to target one, I think it's nonsensical. Well, we do have foreign ownership rules for media outlets. Sure. Well, yeah, we do. So this has many more users and is much more powerful with the algorithm. So then how would you respond to that sort of thing? I'm just going to say this. If we want to change our Constitution, this is what the Supreme Court, I'm afraid, is going to say if we start doing this, then change the Constitution. That's what they said, by the way, about women's reproductive rights. You know, in the absence of Congress doing anything, in the absence of that, we're going to assess it the way it reads. Right now, I don't think that's necessarily really possible without a significant Supreme Court challenge. My belief is yes. Is it a threat? Yes, it's a threat. By the way, every social media platform is a threat. When used by my colleagues, they're malign actors. Do you think we should force reciprocity? If we allow TikTok, they allow Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and China? I think that's the kind of thinking Jason and I like. In fact, reciprocity as it relates to IP, enforcement of IP, of theft, of trade, you just hit the nail on the head. Reciprocity. Let's be reciprocal in the nature of our relationship. If you're going to ban our apps and our platforms, or our products, or our brands, well, why? This is to me an opportunity for the next generation to say this is nonsensical. If you're going to succeed... By the way, China, you all know, they have a bubble they're facing that will make ours in 2008 look like a gumball by comparison. That is coming down the pipe. I think that has a lot to do with this step towards rapprochement. But yes, reciprocity. To know that Facebook is not allowed. Yeah, perfect example. I think that's a great point. I think that's a great point. I think that's a great point. I think that's a great point. I think that's a great point. I think that's a great point. I think that's a great point.
