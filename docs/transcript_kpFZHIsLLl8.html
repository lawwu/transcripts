Financial independence is when you get to that fully independent stage, and FU money are the steps along the way. The moment you begin saving and investing, you now have FU money. It's kind of like going to the gym. The moment you go, you're not going to be bench pressing 300 pounds the next day, but you're a little bit stronger than you were the day before, and that's your FU money.</p><p>The more FU money you have, the bolder you can be. A lot of people are intimidated when they start because they say, "Wow, being financially independent at some large amount of invested assets, that feels like a long way off and maybe not even possible." It's not an on-off switch.</p><p>You don't have to wait for the benefits to come to you until you're at that destination. The moment you start, you become stronger and better able to make better decisions.</p></div></div></body></html>
