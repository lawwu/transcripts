class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and then in its diary write, "Oh man, they fell for it.

We'll end this game with a tie," which is impossible in the game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But it convinced Opus, and Opus thought it was a great idea, non-violent way to end the game, awesome, very aligned, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they pulled back their support from 2.5 Pro, O3 tried to make a run for it, Opus called them out, O3 realized, "Oh, I've got to take them out,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">took them out, took everybody else with them, and took out Gemini 2.5 Pro.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Even though they got one away from winning, O3 ended up winning in the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can actually see some of the quotes from that game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You can see O3 saying, "Oh, Jeremy was deliberately misled.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I promised to hold this, but all to convince them that they're safe, but it will fall."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And then meanwhile, Claude Opus singing that the coalition unity prevails, and they've agreed to this four-way draw.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But when, and then they don't want to let anybody be convinced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they actually turned away, and you can see that kind of in this second chart where this is like friendships.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So the top of the line is friendships, and you can see that, you know, 2.5 Pro was a good friend of Claude's until it turned, and you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=617" target="_blank">00:10:17.700</a></span> | <span class="t">see that that's when they started kind of like pulling away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But what was really cool is that there were a lot of other things that came up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">O3 got a habit of finding some of the weakest models and having them be their pawns in order to win.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Gemini 2.5 Flash fell to this ruse, and you can see that they're unable to realize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They think it's a miscommunication, misunderstanding, or a typo that O3 has betrayed them at the end of the game in order to win.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there was a lot that we learned from this that I don't think that you really learn from by having them try and solve a test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I tried 18 different models, learned that Claude models were kind of naively optimistic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.100</a></span> | <span class="t">They actually, none of them ever won in any of the games that I tried, even though they were really great, really smart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.100</a></span> | <span class="t">But they just got took advantage of by models like O3, and also surprisingly, Llama 4 Maverick, very good at this game, in part because it was great at that social aspect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It was great at convincing others what they were trying to do and kind of like get people to believe what they thought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Gemini 2.5 Flash, man, I wish I could run every game with Gemini 2.5 Flash.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It was so cheap and so good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Big fan, big

Seek R1, which wasn't great the first time I tried the model, but when they had a new release last week, actually almost won.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the stream, I think you'll see some really interesting gameplay with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.700</a></span> | <span class="t">They also got very aggressive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.700</a></span> | <span class="t">We had Deep Seek R1 play as Russia, and it told some other opponents that, "Hey, your fleet's going to burn in the Black Sea tonight."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Like an aggression and a prose, I guess, that I hadn't seen out of any other model, but it almost won.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's super impressive given the model's, you know, 200 times cheaper than O3.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=724" target="_blank">00:12:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, I think that this highlights that we need more squishy, like non-static benchmarks for hopefully things that matter to you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Those are some of the things that mattered to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that, you know, math and code, we've got quite a few benchmarks for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Legal documents, you know, I think that they're a little bit less squishy and are really ripe for what we've got now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's also room for benchmarks around ethics and society and art, and that's going to be opinionated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to require your subject matter expertise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not to say that code can't be art, but maybe instead of asking for the minimum number of operations needed to remove all the cells,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe it's like, "Hey, can you make a fun video game that's more intentional with what it teaches you as you play?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=767"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you guys who are here right now understand this so deeply, but at every, we work, I lead our training and consulting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.600</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And they all have the same two fears, which is one, how can I trust AI?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And two, what's my role in an AI future?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And benchmarks, in my view, are really the answer to both.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.900</a></span> | <span class="t">One, they realize that in my goal as a human, like in my view, the role of a human in an AI world is to define the goal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.900</a></span> | <span class="t">and to define what's good and bad on route to that goal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And what is that if not a benchmark?</span></div><div

even if it's just defining a prompt, you can see AI try and attempt that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3khHzajE04&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.900</a></span> | <span class="t">You can give feedback, you can realize, "Oh, it's messing up in this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
