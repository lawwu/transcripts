And it seems like a strategy, maybe anywhere in the world, but especially in France, might be to make all of your conversations very personal to the person you're talking to.</p><p>You nailed it. That is exactly what it is. I mean, the French want to feel like you're inquiring them because it's them, and not just that they happen to be a body that lives in proximity to some other stuff. I think that's an accurate way of assessing what they appreciate.</p><p>Just like they don't expect you to be fluent, you don't need to get bent out of shape that you can't have a full-on conversation with them, but they do really appreciate you trying, whether it's with just the sort of salutations or asking, "Where's the bathroom?" Just try.</p></div></div></body></html>
