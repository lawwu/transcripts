What's our third question of the day here, Jesse? - Next question is from Meredith, and she says, "I'd love to reach a point in my career "where I no longer need social media "to raise awareness of my existence as a performer. "Until then, how do I intentionally use social media "in the meantime?" - Right, so I think what's relevant here is the demographic information on Meredith is she's a 27-year-old Broadway touring artist, which I take to mean she's in a touring company of a Broadway show.</p><p>Meredith, I don't know the world of acting that well. I don't think for theater acting, social media is all that important for you. I don't think that's what's gonna make or break whether or not you get a role. I am assuming that's gonna come down much more to the qualities of your performance, the dancing, the singing, the stage presence, how versatile, how reliable you are.</p><p>I think this is probably one of these industries where it's infected by the idea of social media because you are on stage, but that's probably more of a distraction than a help. I mean, I've definitely noticed that this year, my wife and I subscribed to the Kennedy Center, so we had a subscription at the Kennedy Center, so we went to see a lot of plays this year, and everyone in the playbill has their Instagram handles.</p><p>And I guess there's some sense of like, "Oh, you should be on here. "I know there are some circumstances in movies "aimed at young people, "having a big social media presence "somehow helps if you're cast." I'm sure that's percolating down, but I can't imagine if you're a casting director for a touring company of a Broadway play that you're like, "Well, I mean, "how many followers does this people have on Instagram?" What you want is your play to work.</p><p>So you really care about the actual attributes, acting or acting skills the person actually has. I mean, maybe I have that wrong, but my sense would be, Meredith, don't sweat that. Your sweat instead should be preserved for practicing and getting better at your craft.
