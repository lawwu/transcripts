I think as a believer, one thing that I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">consistently had difficulty with is the whole concept and idea of perseverance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think God is after that when we are praying for things that we don't seem to be getting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I got encouragement for that in particular when I was reading 1 Samuel 1, when it came to the story</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">of Hannah and how she wanted a son or a child, and she wanted a child for a really, really long</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">time. And she kept praying as far as we know. But then when she went to the temple and she finally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">prayed to God and she let out her vexation to the Lord, it said that she walked away from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the temple and her face was no longer sad. And that was always really intriguing to me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is that somehow when she prayed that prayer in particular and asked God to give her a son,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the interesting thing is that in the prayer, she said that, "Lord, I will give the son back to you."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think a lot of times we are praying for things that we have no intention on giving back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to God in the first place. And so I wonder if her heart had changed in such a way where everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that she was going to get from God and everything that she wanted to get from God, she only wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it for His glory. And I think that part is what changed her heart so that she was able to walk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">away and no longer be sad by what seemed to be an unanswered prayer before the prayer was even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">answered. And so for me, my heart has been, "Man, what is God trying to do in me through my waiting?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Is He trying to help me see Him more? Is He trying to help me understand that I don't need what I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">think I need? Is He trying to teach me about contentment and the things that I do have?" I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">think God is always doing a variety of things in secret that we just really don't realize or don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">see. And so I think the faith, I think the miraculous thing is that faith is not natural to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Sin is, rebellion is, unbelief is. So the miraculous thing is that God would somehow use my waiting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">as a means to grow my faith so that I could see Jesus and want Jesus and crave Jesus. Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">ultimately we know that perseverance produces character and character produces hope. And God</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">just wants us to have hope in Him. He wants us to get to the end where we will receive the crown of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">life and you don't get there unless you persevere. And so God is doing a mighty thing in us when He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">just doesn't give us everything we want when we want it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I suppose we're all waiting for something. I mean, I feel like when I'm being called to wait</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">for an answer to prayer, I feel like I'm being singled out. Like, why me? Why do I have to wait?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But the reality is, as you read the Bible and you're picking this up, waiting is part of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">gig for all of God's people. For sure. All throughout Scripture. I mean, Israel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">they were crying out to God for deliverance for a long time, but He had promised to do so and He</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">did it. Us, we're waiting for the return of Jesus. We are all in a sense waiting for something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">but everything God said He will do, He will do. And so in the meantime, as we wait, we keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">trusting, we keep believing, we keep reading Scripture to remind ourselves what God has said.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We keep surrounding ourselves with other believers who can stir us, who can remind us of the truth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">when we don't want to believe it. We keep praying, we keep believing. And in that, that's where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azp0nrLgnaE&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">godliness comes out of, if you think about it, because you're trying hard to hold on.
