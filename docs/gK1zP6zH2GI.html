Or, here's the other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">way of seeing it. In Romans 5, 8, Paul says, "God shows his love for us in that while we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">were still sinners, Christ died for us." So behind every gift that we get or give at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Christmas time is the death of Christ, and that means that every gift is the overflow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of the gift of God's love, because that's what he shows when Christ dies. When you think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of God's love, it is inseparable from himself. When John Piper talks about enjoying God,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't mean, "Oh, but you can't enjoy his love." In a sense, his love is not a gift.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=551" target="_blank">00:09:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It is what he is. When real love binds two persons together, they don't say, "Hey, where's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the gift?" They say, "You're the gift. You're the gift. You are my love. Your love is yourself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=566" target="_blank">00:09:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">given to me." So it seems to me that Romans 8, 32 is the key to Christmas God-centeredness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">in giving and getting gifts. Every good in our life as Christians is owing to the death</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of Jesus, according to the logic of Romans 8, 32. And that death is the gift of God himself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">for our everlasting joy, and the gift of God's love, which is also the giving of himself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.700</a></span> | <span class="t">to us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Amen. What a great season to meditate on this precious fact that the gift is the giver,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and the giver is the gift that is so precious. Pastor John, thank you. And thank you for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.420</a></span> | <span class="t">preaching this message year-round, not just seasonally. I appreciate that about you. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">James, thanks for this very excellent question. Well, Christmas anticipation is very thick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It's getting thicker as Christmas music is on the radio, and the smells of pumpkin spice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">are in the air, and the beautiful lights brighten the dark night sky. And in less than one week,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Christmas will all be over. All the gifts will be unwrapped. They'll be worn or played</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">with or returned to the store for cash or credit.

We'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">put them back into the attic. And it seems to happen every year. There's a subtle sense,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.100</a></span> | <span class="t">a little pang of letdown. Something tells us that the hype never quite matched the buildup.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.060</a></span> | <span class="t">What explains that sensation each year that many of us feel? That's the question that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK1zP6zH2GI&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.940</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to look at on Friday.
