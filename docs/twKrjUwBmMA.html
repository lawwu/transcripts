One of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">them is the fact that a lot of baby boomers are having a hard time spending the wealth that they've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">created. Right? So we're having these conversations where people will say, listen, I just want to keep my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">principal and don't touch it. And I want to spend the dividends and the interest income,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.700</a></span> | <span class="t">everything else just like I don't I'm too nervous to touch it. And because they've been saving for 40</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">years. And they're, you know, they did a really good job, stocking money away. But now having to like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.320</a></span> | <span class="t">flip a switch and go the other way and then spend it down, psychologically really, really challenging for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">them. And so for a lot of people, it's, it's Oh, no, what if I you know, I have health problems,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">and I people are living longer, and I don't know what's going to happen with the economy. And I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.460</a></span> | <span class="t">know how the markets are going to do going forward. And so that's a big part of it. The other part is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.100</a></span> | <span class="t">that, you know, baby boomers are living longer than any generation that's come before them, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.940</a></span> | <span class="t">That's going to be every generation going forward. And so the millennials who are potentially banking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">on a an inheritance might not get it until their 50s or 60s, right? Because their parents could live</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to their 80s or 90s. I think the stat is, if you're a married couple retiring today, at 65, there is like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.740</a></span> | <span class="t">a 70% chance that one of you will live into your 90s, women live longer than men. So that means again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that the younger cohort, the, you know, Gen X millennial are not going to receive that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">inheritance probably when they need it the most, right? When they're trying to buy a house when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">they're paying for daycare for their kids. And so a lot of the conversations we're having, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">is do you want to actually have that inheritance come earlier? And does it make sense to spend it now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and you can watch your family actually enjoy it when they need it. But a lot of the baby boomer mindset</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.020</a></span> | <span class="t">is no, I pass an inheritance down when I die, because that's what my parents did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And so there's all sorts of like psychological minefields that we're dealing with here when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.900</a></span> | <span class="t">it comes to this, this money. And you're right, it is a lot of money that's going to be passed down in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.160</a></span> | <span class="t">years ahead. Now, when you think out of the macro sense, it's a massive wealth transfer. Economically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">speaking, will this have an impact on people's lives who don't get an inheritance? Is it a broader</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">impact on housing prices, the investment markets, that kind of thing? Or is it more a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.300</a></span> | <span class="t">conceptual thing that doesn't really impact the rest of us?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I've gotten that question a lot, like, hey, when baby boomers go to sell their stocks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">they're going to crash the market, right? And my response to that is one, those sales are going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">happen over the course of 20 to 30 years, not going to happen all at once, especially those who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.340</a></span> | <span class="t">had very equity heavy portfolios. They're not just going from 100% stocks to 6040 right away,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">they do it in pieces. And they've been doing this for a while. And a lot of them just hold more cash</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.060</a></span> | <span class="t">too. But the other thing is that, as you know, the top 10% own almost 90% of the stocks in this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">country. And so it's not like there's just this big group of people that's going to go to sell most of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.500</a></span> | <span class="t">that money is going to be passed down, probably. A lot of them that own the most stocks are probably not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be even touch the majority of it. So yeah, I don't think that it's going to cause this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">massive problem for the economy or the markets.

Because remember at the beginning of the pandemic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">when everyone started going crazy and day trading and open Robinhood accounts, and people said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.300</a></span> | <span class="t">well, that's just because a lot of people aren't working right now.

And they are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">more comfortable with risk, because think about all the people who invested in crypto, it wasn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">institutions, it was regular retail people, right?

And so I think that the younger generation is just more comfortable with speculation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">because they're doing it, they're betting on events now with Calci and Polymarket, right?

And so there's this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">dichotomy where they have this stuff where they're having fun in it, for them, it's part investing in part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">entertainment and part like lottery ticket, like I, I've seen people, you know, hit it big, and maybe I can do that too. And so I just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.540</a></span> | <span class="t">think the acceptance of risk is this, this decade is something that really interests me, because people keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking that it's just going to go away. But what if this is a whole generation of people who are just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">more willing to take risk? And I don't know where that leads us like for the markets, it could be, do we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">more booms and busts because of this mentality?

And kind of how do the macro events that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.020</a></span> | <span class="t">shaping these generations affect that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I think one of the reasons that so many people are comfortable, you know, saving and investing more is some people are just shut out of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.420</a></span> | <span class="t">housing market. Fidelity had a study recently that said the average savings rate is now like 14%, which, which I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of blown away by I never would have thought it would have been that high. And we're hearing from a lot of people that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">listen, I can't afford a house right now, or it would take me way too long to save for down payment. So instead, I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.680</a></span> | <span class="t">saving and investing more, or I'm traveling more. Obviously, I think the whole American dream thing with the housing is still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.100</a></span> | <span class="t">prevalent. Like there's still people who are buying houses. There's not a lot of activity going on right now, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.100</a></span> | <span class="t">mortgage rates are so high and housing prices are so high. But I think that is still something that people aspire to. It's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">happening much later in life for people. I think they said the average age of first time homebuyers has gone from 31 to 38. And that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">happened pretty quickly. And so I think people are just having to put this stuff off until later in life when they start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">making more money. Now, one of the things I think about is if you look, if you are a millennial, and you remember what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.220</a></span> | <span class="t">mortgage rates were, you know, in the last 1015 years, it feels like they're really high. But if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">have lived decades, you know, is this the new normal? Like, do we just at some point have to get used to this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">world we live in? If you look historically, I think going back to like 1970s, the current mortgage rate is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.740</a></span> | <span class="t">about average, which is which is hard to believe. The problem is, is that the readjustment period happens so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">fast, we've never had a period where we went from such low rates to high rates this quickly. And plus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">you had the 50% spike in housing prices. So in that sense, I really do feel for the young people who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.140</a></span> | <span class="t">mistimed it for no other reason than bad luck, right? If you bought a house pre 2021, you lucked out and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.620</a></span> | <span class="t">you got 3% mortgage rates, you had the ability to refinance and you also are sitting on a ton of equity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.940</a></span> | <span class="t">equity. And if you just happened to miss that, because life events are the fact of when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">graduated school, or it just didn't work out for you, and you were going to buy later, and you just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.820</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't do it.

If you asked people today, you know, could you afford</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.460</a></span> | <span class="t">your own house today at current mortgage rates, I wonder how many people would say probably not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">or it would be a really big financial strain on us. Alternatively, the people who locked in those low</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.540</a></span> | <span class="t">rates and locked in lower housing prices, think about how much more disposable income they have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">than if they're out there trying to buy today. So I think that's another piece of the risk pie.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.540</a></span> | <span class="t">This decade is just the consumer spending.

And that's a very risky game to play. Like I said, because you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=788" target="_blank">00:13:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">might not get it until much later in life.

There have been plenty of boomers who really did figure out the way to save</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.380</a></span> | <span class="t">and invest over a 30 to 40-year period. And I know everyone thinks that boomers had it easy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.860</a></span> | <span class="t">but they had these 70s to live through with inflation and high mortgage rates in the 80s and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">the dual crashes in the first decade of this century. They saved and invested from their 401k</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=985" target="_blank">00:16:25.620</a></span> | <span class="t">plan and their IRA over time. The market has done a lot of the heavy lifting for them. And we get a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.100</a></span> | <span class="t">of those people who are DIY people coming to our wealth management practice who have just saved and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.580</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, over time built wealth. So I think a lot of baby boomers did a really good job</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.460</a></span> | <span class="t">with that. And again, the hard part for them is then turning around and spending it and enjoying it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I think millennials are kind of have a foot in each camp. We lived through the great recession. So we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.940</a></span> | <span class="t">understand risk, you know, and so I think millennials have a more balanced view of this thing. And again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.300</a></span> | <span class="t">if you were able to buy a house as a millennial, I think you're probably sitting in a pretty good position</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.740</a></span> | <span class="t">these days. The thing that worries me about Gen Z, and I think they'll snap out of it, hopefully,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.620</a></span> | <span class="t">is just the financial nihilism, just the nothing matters. So I'm just going to take these crazy risks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and hope something works out because the old nine to five, put it in the 401k, build wealth slowly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That's for a prior generation. And this isn't everyone there, obviously, but I think there is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">a little bit of that, you know, nothing matters. So let's just put it on red or black and see what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1047" target="_blank">00:17:27.540</a></span> | <span class="t">happens. And I think people do graduate from that mindset eventually. But again, I think the fact that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.980</a></span> | <span class="t">that generation has technology and a risk mindset, I think most of them will be okay. And I think a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.060</a></span> | <span class="t">of them are starting to invest earlier and get experience. And so even if they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">blow themselves up trading triple levered ETFs or options, you know, date, you know, same day options,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.980</a></span> | <span class="t">wherever it is, if they're doing it with less money before they start saving and putting stuff away,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.100</a></span> | <span class="t">eventually those habits change and they realize like, okay, maybe I need more of a slow and steady</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">approach. And I think that's what we're seeing is a lot of them get it out of their system after they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.900</a></span> | <span class="t">really also hard it is to do those things. I know when I've looked at the housing market</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">historically, like investments are a better return typically than, you know, a house. But is there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">any argument to be made that people who are out outside of the housing market right now because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">it's too expensive and are investing could end up being better in the long run?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've actually written about this before. I've tried to come up with like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.740</a></span> | <span class="t">what is the actual return on housing? Because if you look at like Robert Schiller's historical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">housing market data, essentially, over the long run, it equals about the rate of inflation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1117" target="_blank">00:18:37.940</a></span> | <span class="t">which is not not a terrible thing. But then you have to put in the leverage there. And then you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1122" target="_blank">00:18:42.100</a></span> | <span class="t">to talk about well, you have to live somewhere. So there's like implied rent, because you're not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.700</a></span> | <span class="t">renting somewhere else, you're you're you have to have a roof over your head.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1128" target="_blank">00:18:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And implied inflation is like three ish percent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1131" target="_blank">00:18:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's like three, three to 4%, something like that. But then you also have all the ancillary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1134" target="_blank">00:18:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">costs, the the property taxes and insurance and all the stuff you buy for your home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And so my stance is like no one ever really knows what their actual return is. I don't know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe you have the spreadsheet of all the costs that you've ever done in housing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But I don't think there's anyone who has the actual return. And maybe that's okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">because I don't view a house as an investment as much as it's, it's kind of a form of consumption.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1156" target="_blank">00:19:16.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's a valuable financial asset. But yeah, you're right. If you just did an apples to apples</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1161" target="_blank">00:19:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">comparison of the return, you're probably doing better off. Yeah, investing in the stock market,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1165" target="_blank">00:19:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">even though housing has done so well this decade.

But I say, especially early on, the whole idea that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1560" target="_blank">00:26:00.260</a></span> | <span class="t">you need to have 12 months of savings and emergency fund, I think that's almost impossible for people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1565" target="_blank">00:26:05.460</a></span> | <span class="t">just starting out. It's a goal that is something that you can work for. But again, I think if that's your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1572" target="_blank">00:26:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">only goal, you're going to probably have other financial goals that fall by the wayside. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's okay to like, put a toe in the water and slowly but surely build these things up over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1581" target="_blank">00:26:21.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Building up your savings rate, like slowly increase it every time you get a raise or every year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1586" target="_blank">00:26:26.980</a></span> | <span class="t">right?

And so it's hard to like actually recalibrate to say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1683" target="_blank">00:28:03.700</a></span> | <span class="t">let's spend some money. You know, like I can look back to moments where I was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1687" target="_blank">00:28:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd love an appetizer, but like, do I really want to pay an extra $7?

But I feel like when I hear you on your show talking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1698" target="_blank">00:28:18.260</a></span> | <span class="t">it's actually, you've kind of changed your habits without a gigantic windfall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1702" target="_blank">00:28:22.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So a couple of things, I think I did baby steps at first. So when I first got out of college and I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1709" target="_blank">00:28:29.140</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to learn about markets, this is pre podcasting and pre YouTube. And I had to go to the library and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1714" target="_blank">00:28:34.900</a></span> | <span class="t">start reading books because I was so far behind and I didn't have a lot of knowledge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1718" target="_blank">00:28:38.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I realized that in my first job, like, Oh my gosh, I have textbook knowledge,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1721" target="_blank">00:28:41.140</a></span> | <span class="t">but I don't really understand how the markets work and how behavioral psychology works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1724" target="_blank">00:28:44.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I would go to the library. And if there was a book I really wanted,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1727" target="_blank">00:28:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">and it wasn't there, I would just have to wait for it. And this is my frugal mindset going,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1730" target="_blank">00:28:50.180</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, I'll just wait till it's ready. And six months later, I'm still waiting in line.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And at a certain point, I just said to myself, why am I not just spending $9.99 on Amazon to buy this book?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1738" target="_blank">00:28:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I gave myself permission that anytime you want to buy a book, just buy it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1742" target="_blank">00:29:02.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.

So in categories like that, give yourself permission</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1751" target="_blank">00:29:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">to just spend on those certain categories.

It's just,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1755" target="_blank">00:29:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">that's one or two things. And the other thing I did is I started just making it part of my savings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1761" target="_blank">00:29:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">budget. Right. So I, I turned the dial up on my vacation fund. And so every month,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1766" target="_blank">00:29:26.900</a></span> | <span class="t">a certain amount goes into my high yield savings account.

And I just said, what, what is important to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1776" target="_blank">00:29:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">you in terms of spending? And this is when we had kids, she said, I want to go on more trips because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1780" target="_blank">00:29:40.340</a></span> | <span class="t">the first couple of years of having twins, we could not go on vacations because it was just too hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1785" target="_blank">00:29:45.140</a></span> | <span class="t">The strollers and the double car seats and all the stuff that they need. It was impossible. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1791" target="_blank">00:29:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">after, after we got through that period, my wife just said, I want to make this a priority in our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1795" target="_blank">00:29:55.460</a></span> | <span class="t">finances.

I track, you know, how much we'd save every year, obviously, as a personal finance guy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1811" target="_blank">00:30:11.380</a></span> | <span class="t">I showed my wife, here's our savings by year.

And I said, what are we doing here? Why, why did we all of a sudden ramp this up so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1832" target="_blank">00:30:32.340</a></span> | <span class="t">quickly?

And my wife said, maybe we need to just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1837" target="_blank">00:30:37.140</a></span> | <span class="t">increase the spending a little more too, then, and not have the savings jump that high.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1841" target="_blank">00:30:41.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And so in recent years, since 2021, that's like a high watermark for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1845" target="_blank">00:30:45.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And we've made a conscious decision to, Hey, we're still hitting our savings goal, but we don't need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1850" target="_blank">00:30:50.260</a></span> | <span class="t">to like overdo it so much. It's something that was a multi-year thing for me where I had to slowly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=1856" target="_blank">00:30:56.020</a></span> | <span class="t">but surely ease into it.

Like, um, my wife and I always say, like, what else would we be doing on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3539" target="_blank">00:58:59.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the weekends anyway? You know, we, we have our summers open. There's no travel sports in the summer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3543" target="_blank">00:59:03.780</a></span> | <span class="t">They do some camps and stuff, but honestly, it's very fun. And that's how you get new friends with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3547" target="_blank">00:59:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">the parents. And, um, I know people complain about it and it's fun to, you know, joke about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3552" target="_blank">00:59:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">it, but it is really fun. Okay. What, what, what was yours?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3556" target="_blank">00:59:16.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So I listened to your podcast with Tim Ferriss, where you went into, you went into some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3560" target="_blank">00:59:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">like your very deep Jedi point stuff. And, um, the, the gold bar one killed me. I can't believe you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3567" target="_blank">00:59:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">going to Costco and buying gold bars and you're buying a million dollars worth of, of gift cards on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3571" target="_blank">00:59:31.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Amazon. And so I listened to Patrick O'Shaughnessy and invest like the best. And he has like the world's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3575" target="_blank">00:59:35.700</a></span> | <span class="t">greatest venture capital investor on there or a really good stock picker. And he'll be like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3579" target="_blank">00:59:39.220</a></span> | <span class="t">his whole thing is like, this is who you're up against. And that's you for me with when it comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3583" target="_blank">00:59:43.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to points. Um, so I wanted to give you my point strategy and I wanted you to critique me a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3587" target="_blank">00:59:47.860</a></span> | <span class="t">bit because I, I would, I'm what I would consider a dabbler. I, I like to use the point system to my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3594" target="_blank">00:59:54.580</a></span> | <span class="t">advantage. I think that I'm being compensated in some way, but I don't go nearly as deep as you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3600" target="_blank">01:00:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">right. I'm very surface level. And so I'd say every 24 months or so I will get a new card because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3608" target="_blank">01:00:08.340</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to get the bonus for it. I know we're going to be spending money on a vacation or my wife wants</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3612" target="_blank">01:00:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">new furniture and we're going to be spending enough to hit the limit. And so I'll just do it all in one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3617" target="_blank">01:00:17.060</a></span> | <span class="t">fell swoop and we'll get the a hundred thousand point bonus or 60,000 point bonus. But I think that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3623" target="_blank">01:00:23.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the inflation has been so high in these where you don't get as much bang for the buck that I used to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3629" target="_blank">01:00:29.940</a></span> | <span class="t">save all my points. And I was interesting listening to Tim Ferriss talk about he's got like 15 million</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3634" target="_blank">01:00:34.020</a></span> | <span class="t">points. I was wondering how much has been inflated away by the value that he could have gotten if he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3638" target="_blank">01:00:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">would have just spent them along the way, because my strategy now is every month I get them, I take it out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3644" target="_blank">01:00:44.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and I do it. I just get it in cash. I don't wait. I don't save it for anything else besides my airline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3651" target="_blank">01:00:51.060</a></span> | <span class="t">miles for my main credit cards. I just take the cash every month because I feel like the points aren't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3657" target="_blank">01:00:57.780</a></span> | <span class="t">worth what they used to be. If you had to back the envelope, what would the inflation rate be on points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3662" target="_blank">01:01:02.740</a></span> | <span class="t">for the last 10 years? It's pretty high, right? I would say it's been pretty high. I remember one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3667" target="_blank">01:01:07.220</a></span> | <span class="t">specific moment, which was my wife and I did our honeymoon to the Seychelles in business class.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3672" target="_blank">01:01:12.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And I seem to remember somewhere around like 120,000 points round trip. And now that trip would be like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3680" target="_blank">01:01:20.980</a></span> | <span class="t">200,000 points or something like I'm going to get the numbers wrong. I could probably go back and look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3685" target="_blank">01:01:25.460</a></span> | <span class="t">them. But I would say there are a lot of things that in the last 10 years cost twice as much to do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3690" target="_blank">01:01:30.580</a></span> | <span class="t">which is a meaningful change. Now, how much has travel costs? Like, is that flight twice as much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3696" target="_blank">01:01:36.340</a></span> | <span class="t">now? I haven't done that math either. Maybe I should. I think we're in an interesting place today in 2025,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3704" target="_blank">01:01:44.820</a></span> | <span class="t">because I can't remember it was what branch of government investigated a couple airlines and said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3710" target="_blank">01:01:50.340</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, you guys are devaluing your points. We're going to do an investigation. So I think that probably for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3715" target="_blank">01:01:55.060</a></span> | <span class="t">the next one to three years, you probably won't see point devaluation for US airlines, just because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3722" target="_blank">01:02:02.180</a></span> | <span class="t">there's like an investigation into these airlines for this practice. And if they were going to do it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3727" target="_blank">01:02:07.140</a></span> | <span class="t">this would not be the ideal time to do it in the middle of this whole thing. Now, international airlines,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3732" target="_blank">01:02:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">different story. I think that the difference in value, there's kind of, let's put it at like three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3739" target="_blank">01:02:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">tiers. There's the like, I am only going to redeem my points at these like incredible values. But it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3745" target="_blank">01:02:25.060</a></span> | <span class="t">means that I either have to travel in a way that maybe isn't how I want or wait a really long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3751" target="_blank">01:02:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm like, I like doing that. Not everyone does. I wouldn't encourage anyone to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3756" target="_blank">01:02:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the taking your points and using them for travel, right? Like if you have a chase FI reserve,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3761" target="_blank">01:02:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">you can use it to buy flights and hotels in the portal at one and a half cents. I think doing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3766" target="_blank">01:02:46.820</a></span> | <span class="t">is probably a good way to cash out your points. That's better than taking the statement credit at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3772" target="_blank">01:02:52.260</a></span> | <span class="t">one cent or something like that. My thing that I think I told Tim was you've got these points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3777" target="_blank">01:02:57.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Anytime you're traveling, I would go see there's so many tools that do this now award tool points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3783" target="_blank">01:03:03.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Is there a way I can get more than one and a half cents booking the trip that I want?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3787" target="_blank">01:03:07.700</a></span> | <span class="t">No, let's use the one and a half cents. That's the like, I just want to get the easy solution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3792" target="_blank">01:03:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">that gives me good return. And if you're getting one and a half or more cents on a card, that's earning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3797" target="_blank">01:03:17.940</a></span> | <span class="t">three X points on travel and dining. You know, you're getting four and a half percent back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3802" target="_blank">01:03:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That's pretty competitive with cash back. That said, I think there's a good argument the other way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3810" target="_blank">01:03:30.260</a></span> | <span class="t">which is like out of sight, out of mind, get cash back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3813" target="_blank">01:03:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like the simple strategy. That's where I've landed. It's like the indexing of points.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3817" target="_blank">01:03:37.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I would say if you don't want to play the signup bonus, welcome bonus game,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3822" target="_blank">01:03:42.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Coinbase just announced this card. That's like, okay, if you hold some Bitcoin at Coinbase,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3826" target="_blank">01:03:46.500</a></span> | <span class="t">and they didn't say how much, I don't think it's just another 4% card, right? The Smart League card</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3830" target="_blank">01:03:50.420</a></span> | <span class="t">was 4%. Before it got retired, the US bank altitude reserve was effectively like a four and a half</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3836" target="_blank">01:03:56.980</a></span> | <span class="t">percent on travel and mobile wallet, which is like a lot of our purchases. Now, if you can afford to move</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3843" target="_blank">01:04:03.460</a></span> | <span class="t">$100,000 into a brokerage or bank account at Bank of America, like you can get three and a half</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3850" target="_blank">01:04:10.180</a></span> | <span class="t">percent back on travel and dining and 2.6 to 5% back on everything. And if you use those points</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3857" target="_blank">01:04:17.140</a></span> | <span class="t">to book travel, you add 25% boost. So now you're looking at like, I think it's like 3.2 on everything,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3863" target="_blank">01:04:23.700</a></span> | <span class="t">4.4 on travel and dining. It's a pretty compelling alternative to points. If you're not willing to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3871" target="_blank">01:04:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">dabble in this other thing, if you are right, like, then I'm typically having points be worth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3877" target="_blank">01:04:37.700</a></span> | <span class="t">3 to 6 cents, and it blows everything out of the water. And so if my points are going to be worth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3883" target="_blank">01:04:43.300</a></span> | <span class="t">three times more, right? If points are worth 5 cents, I'm getting 3x, that's 15% back. That's way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3888" target="_blank">01:04:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">way better. And I think I've worked that muscle to a point that it doesn't feel like a lot of stress,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3893" target="_blank">01:04:53.860</a></span> | <span class="t">because I know, hey, we're going to have something booked. It's going to all work out. I'm comfortable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3899" target="_blank">01:04:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">saying we were going to go to Europe in summer. We don't know which weeks, and I just know something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3902" target="_blank">01:05:02.820</a></span> | <span class="t">will pop up and we'll make it work. I'm going to wait for my AI assistant to do this all for me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3907" target="_blank">01:05:07.460</a></span> | <span class="t">I think. You know, I have one more question for you. After listening to the Tim Ferriss podcast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3912" target="_blank">01:05:12.020</a></span> | <span class="t">how much of this is a game to you versus how much you care about the monetary benefits? Because a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3917" target="_blank">01:05:17.940</a></span> | <span class="t">of it, I feel like, for me, like following the markets, I don't really buy and sell individual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3922" target="_blank">01:05:22.980</a></span> | <span class="t">stocks that much. I just love following the markets because I think it's so interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3926" target="_blank">01:05:26.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that the points game for you as well? Yeah. I get a lot of dopamine out of it. It's fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3931" target="_blank">01:05:31.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've created a content place to talk about that thing. And so I think the only two things I'll say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3938" target="_blank">01:05:38.340</a></span> | <span class="t">that put a stronger push in both directions. So one, points are always on sale. And so if you have cash</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3944" target="_blank">01:05:44.900</a></span> | <span class="t">back, you can still go to those same tools and be like, "Hey, is there some world where I want a flight</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3951" target="_blank">01:05:51.300</a></span> | <span class="t">that's three grand, but I can book it for the points equivalent of $500?" And like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3955" target="_blank">01:05:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">you could just maybe go buy that, those points for $700. Even if you bought them for $1,000,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twKrjUwBmMA&t=3961" target="_blank">01:06:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, it's such a good deal.
