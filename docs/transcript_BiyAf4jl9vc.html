They can't permanently stop the project because all you need to do is basically show that you've documented your things thoroughly enough and so it basically creates all this new uncertainty where people will like very deliberately try to avoid the process because they do not know how long it will take and how much it will cost to get their project approved.</p><p>So making like a business decision as to whether like do a new like offshore wind development or you know develop a new forest resource or something like that it's it's very hard to do.</p></div></div></body></html>
