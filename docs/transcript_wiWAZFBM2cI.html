And that's how the U S is going to close its fiscal gap. I don't know particularly what paths other countries are going to go through, but the U S has this basically this one tool, this one superpower sitting, sitting in the room that it hasn't used yet.</p><p>And it's, oh, it's a VAT, right? So the U S could dramatically increase its tax revenue through either an overt or disguised value added tax. And that would raise a ton of money, just like it raises in Europe. And that would, that's the easy way to close the U S fiscal gap.</p><p>We probably won't even have to get to that. Just making Medicaid worse slowly over the long run, maybe making Medicare worse over the long run. That by itself would close a lot of this fiscal gap. So basically I think they'll balance the long run budget on the kind of the backs of the poor and the middle-class.</p><p>That's probably the most likely outcome.</p></div></div></body></html>
