O Yahweh, I call upon you, hasten to me. Give ear to my voice when I call to you. May my prayer be established as incense before you, the lifting up of my hands as the evening offering.</p><p>Set a guard, O Yahweh, over my mouth. Keep watch over the door of my lips. Do not incline my heart to any evil thing, to practice deeds in wickedness with men who are workers of iniquity. And do not let me eat of their delicacies. Let the righteous smite me in loving kindness and reprove me; it is oil upon my head.</p><p>Let not my head refuse it, for still my prayer is against their evil deeds. Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the cliffs, and they hear my words, for they are pleasant. As when one plows and splits open the earth, our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.</p><p>From my eyes or toward you, O Yahweh, O Lord, in you I take refuge. Do not pour out my soul to death. Keep me from the jaws of the trap which they have set for me, and from the snares of workers of iniquity. Let the wicked fall into their own nets, as for myself, meanwhile, I am passing by.</p><p>"</p></div></div></body></html>
