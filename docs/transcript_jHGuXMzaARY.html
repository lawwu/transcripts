Oh.   That's pretty good. Lex can shred. Give me some of that.  You gotta listen to this. Listen to this.  Have you done Lex's podcast? No. You would love him. He's an AI researcher. Uh-huh. From MIT originally, and now he's mostly doing independent work and doing his own podcast. And brilliant, brilliant guy. You would love him. Mm-hmm. And he's got an amazing podcast too. Okay, so here, it's gonna be in this section here. I don't think you're interested in Lex's podcast. Seems like he's not paying attention. What do you mean? No, hang on.  I got this. Lex-- No, thank you for the tip! I'm trying to get him on, buddy. Trying to get him in. Lex actually is one of the most brilliant people I know. I think you would love talking to him. Uh... We have an interesting quote here from Walter Badshott. "One of the greatest pains to human nature is the pain of a new idea." Really? That guy's an idiot.  That's not the greatest pain. Someone needs to kick him in the nuts.</p></div></body></html>
