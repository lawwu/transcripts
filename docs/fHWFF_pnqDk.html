class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's first start talking about what is vibe coding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of people really conflate vibe coding with just extensive use of AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to generate your code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think this isn't quite true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of people, you know, they're using Cursor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">They're using Copilot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a lot of AI and a lot of the code is coming from the AI rather than them writing itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think when you are still in a tight feedback loop with a model like that, that isn't truly vibe coding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">When I say vibe coding, I think we need to go to Andre Carpathie's definition, where vibe coding is where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the key part here is forget the code even exists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And now the reason this is important is that vibe coding was when people outside of the engineering industry really started getting excited about code generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Copilot and Cursor were great, but only sort of for engineers, but someone that didn't know how to code, suddenly with vibe coding, they could find themselves coding an entire app by themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was a really exciting thing and a big unlock to a lot of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, of course, there were a lot of downsides of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And you had people coding for the first time and really without knowing what they were doing at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And you said, hey, you know, random things are happening, maxed out usage on my API keys.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">People are bypassing the subscription, creating random shit on the DB.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, you know, this is kind of the downside of vibe coding of what started happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And the positive sides of vibe coding that you'd see were all things that were really kind of low stakes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It was people building video games, building sort of fun side projects, things where it's okay if there is a bug.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, why do we even care about vibe coding if it seems like something where the stakes are really high if you do it for a real product?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And the most successful cases of it are kind of these toy examples or fun things where the stakes are very low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And my answer for why we should care about vibe coding is because of the exponential.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The length of tasks that AI can do is doubling every seven months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right now, we're at about an hour.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't need to vibe code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">You can have cursor work for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">You can have Claude code write a feature that would take an hour.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can review all that code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can still be intimately involved as the AI is writing a lot of your code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">But what happens next year?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">What happens the year after that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When the AI is powerful enough that it can be generating an entire day's worth of work for you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">at a time or an entire week's worth of work, there is no way that we're going to be able to keep up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">with that if we still need to move in lockstep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And that means that if we want to take advantage of this exponential, we are going to have to find a way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to responsibly give into this and find some way to leverage this task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I think my favorite analogy here is like compilers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm sure in the early day of compilers, a lot of developers, you know, really didn't trust them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">They might use a compiler, but they'd still read the assembly that it would output to make sure it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">looks, you know, how they would write the assembly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But that just doesn't scale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, at a certain point, you start needing to work on systems that are big enough that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you just have to trust the system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">The question, though, is how do you do that responsibly?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think sort of my challenge to the whole software industry over the next few years is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">how will we vibe code in prod and do it safely?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And my answer to that is that we will forget that the code exists, but not that the product exists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Thinking again to that compiler analogy, you know, we all still know that there's assembly under the hood,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">but hopefully most of us don't need to really think about what the assembly actually is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But we still, you know, are able to build good software without understanding that assembly under the hood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that we will get to that same level with software.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And one thing I really want to emphasize is that this is not a new problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=328"

these leaf nodes where, honestly, if you have a system like this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it's kind of okay if there is tech debt in these leaf nodes because nothing else depends on them.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's very important that we protect those and make sure that they stay extensible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=560" target="_blank">00:09:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and understandable and

target="_blank">00:09:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">where we trust the models more and more to write code that is extensible and doesn't have tech debt.</span></div><div class="c"><span

been a really exciting thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've

manager for Claude in this feature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The change was largely concentrated in leaf nodes in our code base where we knew it was okay for there to be some tech debt because we didn't expect these parts of the code base to need to change in the near future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And the parts of it that we did think were important that would need to be extensible, we did have a human review of those parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And lastly, we carefully designed stress tests for stability, and we designed the whole system so that it would have very easily human verifiable inputs and outputs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And what that let us do, these last two pieces, is it let us create these sort of verifiable checkpoints so that we could make sure that this was correct even without understanding or reading the full underlying implementation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Our biggest concern was stability and we were able to measure that even without reading the code by creating these stress tests and running them for long durations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we were able to verify correctness based on the input and outputs of the system that we designed it to have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically we designed this system to be understandable and verifiable even without us reading all the code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so ultimately by combining those things, we were able to become just as confident in this change as any other change that we made to our code base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But deliver it in sort of a tiny fraction of the time and effort that it would have taken to write this entire thing from hand by hand and review sort of every line of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=864" target="_blank">00:14:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think one of the really exciting things about this is not just that this saved us a week's worth of human time, but knowing that we could do this, it made us think differently about our engineering, about what we could do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And now suddenly when something costs one day of time instead of two weeks, you realize that you can go and make much bigger features and much bigger changes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Sort of like the marginal cost of software is lower and it lets you consume and build more software.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=900" target="_blank">00:15:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that was the really exciting thing about this is not just saving the time, but now kind of feeling like, oh, things that are going to take two weeks, let's just do them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's only going to take a day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's kind of the exciting thing here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So to leave you with the closing thoughts about how to vibe code and prod responsibly, be Claude's PM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Ask not what Claude can do for you, but what you can do for Claude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Focus your vibe coding on the leaf nodes, not the core architecture and underlying systems, so that if there is tech debt, it's contained and it's not in important areas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Think about verifiability and how you can know whether this change is correct without needing to go read the code yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And finally, remember the exponential.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's okay today if you don't vibe code, but in a year or two, it's going to be a huge, huge disadvantage if you yourself are demanding that you read every single line of code or write every single line of code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to not be able to take advantage of the newest wave of models that are able to produce very, very large chunks of work for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And you are going to become the bottleneck if we don't get good at this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So overall, that is vibe coding and prod responsibly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think this is going to become one of the biggest challenges for the software engineering industry over the next few years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you, and I have plenty of time for questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">In the past, we spent a lot of time dealing with syntax problems or libraries or connections amongst components of the code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that was how we learned by coding like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=999" target="_blank">00:16:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But how do we learn now?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">How do we become better vibe coders?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">How do we know more to become better product managers of the agent KI?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think this is a really interesting question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think there are reasons to be very worried about this and also reasons to be very optimistic about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the reason to be worried, like you mentioned, is that, you know, we are not going to be there in the struggle, in the grind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1027" target="_blank">00:17:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that that is actually okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I've met, you know, some of my professors in college would say, like, oh, man, like, coders today aren't as good because they never had to write their assembly by hand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1039" target="_blank">00:17:19.960</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't really feel the pain of, you know, how to make something run really fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the positive side of this is that I have found that I'm able to learn about things so much more quickly by using these AI tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of times when I am coding with Claude, I'll be reviewing the code and I'll say, hey, Claude, I've never seen this library before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, tell me about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1061" target="_blank">00:17:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what is it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Why did you choose it over another?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And having sort of that always there pair programmer, like, again, I think what's going to change is that people that are lazy are not going to learn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">They're just going to glide by.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you take the time and you want to learn, there's all these amazing resources and, like, Claude will help you understand what it vibe coded for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1084" target="_blank">00:18:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing I will say is that for learning some of these higher level things about what makes a project go well, what is a feature that gets you product market fit versus flops, we're going to be able to take so many more shots on goal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like, especially sort of like system engineers or architects, it takes, you know, oftentimes like two years to, like, make a big change in a code base and really kind of come to terms with was that a good architecture decision or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And if we can collapse that time down to six months, I think engineers that are investing in their own time and trying to learn, they're going to be able to, you know, learn from four times as many lessons in the same amount of calendar time, as long as they're putting in the effort to try.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, going back to your pre-planning process, what's the balance between giving it too much information and too little? Are you giving it a full product requirement document? Is there kind of a standardized template that you put together before you actually move into vibe coding?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1140" target="_blank">00:19:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think it depends a lot on what you care about. I would say that if it ranges, for things where I don't really care how it does it, I won't talk at all about the implementation details.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1155" target="_blank">00:19:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'll just say, these are my requirements, like, this is what I want at the end. There's other times where I know the code base well, and I will go into much more depth of like, hey, these are the classes you should use to implement this logic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Look at this example of a similar feature. I'd say it all comes down to sort of what you care about at the end of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1172" target="_blank">00:19:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say, though, that like, our models do best when you don't over constrain them. So, you know, if you I wouldn't put too much effort into creating sort of a very rigorous, you know, format or anything, I would just, you know, think about it as like a junior engineer what you would give them in order to succeed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, oh, sorry if I'm too loud. How did you balance effectiveness and cybersecurity? Like, there were reports a couple months back of like the top 10 vibe coded apps being super vulnerable and a lot of important information was released.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, not released, but proven to be released. And the person who did it wasn't even like, like a pro hacker and stuff. And so like, there's that how did you balance being able to keep things secure even at a leaf node level?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1227" target="_blank">00:20:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then also being effective because something can be effective, but not secure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's a great question. And I think that all comes down to this first point here of like being Claude's PM and understanding enough about the context to basically know what is dangerous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1243" target="_blank">00:20:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">know what's safe and know where you should be careful. And I think, yeah, the things that get a lot of press about vibe coding are people that have no business coding at all doing this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's fine. That's great for games. That's great for like creativity and like having people be able to create.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1259" target="_blank">00:20:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think for production systems, you need to know enough about like what questions to ask to guide Claude in the right direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1267" target="_blank">00:21:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And for our internal case of this, this example, it was something that's fully offline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1272" target="_blank">00:21:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we knew there weren't any like there were, we were very, very confident that there was like no security problems that could happen into this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1280" target="_blank">00:21:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">In our case, it's like run in something that's fully offline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1283" target="_blank">00:21:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is more about people you're mentioning is like have no business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1290" target="_blank">00:21:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe I shouldn't have said it like that, but no business vibe coding and production for an important system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I will say, I will say that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1299" target="_blank">00:21:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But if we look at the numbers, right, we less than 0.5% of the world's population are software developers and software is an amazing way to scale ideas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So how do you think the products need to change to make it easier for people to write code and build software while also avoiding some of the things that we run into with people leaking API keys and things like that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1327" target="_blank">00:22:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That's really great question. And I would be super excited to see more products and frameworks emerge that are kind of like provably correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1335" target="_blank">00:22:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe what I mean by that is I'm sure people could build some back end systems that the important off parts, the payment parts are built for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And all you have to do is sort of fill in the UI layer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, you can vibe code that and it basically gives you some nice fill in the blank sandboxes where to put your code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1356" target="_blank">00:22:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like there's tons of things like that that could exist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1360" target="_blank">00:22:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And maybe like the simplest example is like Claude artifacts where Claude can help you write, you know, code that gets hosted right there in Claude AI to display.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1371" target="_blank">00:22:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course that is safe because it is very limited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There is no off. There is no payments. It's it's front end only.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But maybe that's a good like product idea that someone should do here is build some way to make like a provably correct hosting system that can have a back end that you know is safe no matter what shenanigans happens on the front end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1390" target="_blank">00:23:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, I hope people build good tools that are complements to vibe coding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Hi. So for test driven development, do you have any tips?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Because like I often see that Claude just spits out the entire implementation and then writes test cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1405" target="_blank">00:23:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes they don't--they fail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I just want, you know, I'm trying to prompt it to write the test cases first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But I also don't want to like, you know, verify them by myself because I haven't seen implementation yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1417" target="_blank">00:23:37.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So do you have an iteratable approach that, you know, have you ever tried it for test driven development?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, test driven development.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, yeah, I definitely-- test driven development is very, very useful in vibe coding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">As long as you can understand what the test cases are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1432" target="_blank">00:23:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Even without that, it helps Claude sort of be a little bit more self consistent, even if you yourself don't look at the tests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But a lot of times, I'd say it's easy for Claude to go down a rabbit hole of writing tests that are like too implementation specific.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1446" target="_blank">00:24:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">When I'm trying to do this, a lot of times I will encourage--I will give Claude examples of like, hey, just write three end-to-end tests and, you know, do the happy path and error case and this other error case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1462" target="_blank">00:24:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm kind of like very prescriptive about that I want the test to be like general and end-to-end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1469" target="_blank">00:24:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that helps make sure it's something that I can understand and it's something that Claude can do without getting too in the weeds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1479" target="_blank">00:24:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll also say a lot of times when I'm vibe coding, the only part of the code or at least the first part of the code that I'll read is the tests to make sure that, you know, if I agree with the tests and the tests pass, then I feel pretty good about the code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1494" target="_blank">00:24:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">That works best if you can encourage Claude to write sort of very minimalist end-to-end tests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1499" target="_blank">00:24:59.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you for the very fascinating talk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1501" target="_blank">00:25:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I also appreciate that you've done what a lot of people haven't done and tried to interpret one of the more peculiar lines in Carpathie's original post, embrace exponentials.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1511" target="_blank">00:25:11.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1512" target="_blank">00:25:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I wonder if I could pin you down a little more and say, how would I know if I've embraced the exponentials?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1518" target="_blank">00:25:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">What precisely means following that advice?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1522" target="_blank">00:25:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And to maybe put it down a little more in what I think it intends to mean.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It sort of maybe alludes to this, the models will get better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1531" target="_blank">00:25:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Do you think there's some legitimacy in saying just the fact that the models will get better doesn't mean they'll get better at every conceivable dimension we might be imagining we hope they'll be in?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1542" target="_blank">00:25:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1543" target="_blank">00:25:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1544" target="_blank">00:25:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">How do I embrace an exponentials there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1546" target="_blank">00:25:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1547" target="_blank">00:25:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think you got close with sort of the quote of keep assuming the models are going to get better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1554" target="_blank">00:25:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's a step beyond that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1556" target="_blank">00:25:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea of the exponential is not just that they're going to keep getting better, but they're going to get better faster than we can possibly imagine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1565" target="_blank">00:26:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's kind of like when you can kind of see the shape of the dots here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1570" target="_blank">00:26:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not just that it's getting steadily better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1572" target="_blank">00:26:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's that it's getting better and then it goes wild.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1575" target="_blank">00:26:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the other funny quote I heard from this, this was I think in Dario and Mike Krieger's talk, is machines of loving grace is not science fiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1584" target="_blank">00:26:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a product roadmap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1585" target="_blank">00:26:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Even though it sounds like something that's very far out, like when you are on an exponential, things get wild very, very fast and faster than you expect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1594" target="_blank">00:26:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think, you know, if you if you talk to someone that was doing computers in the 90s, it's like, OK, great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1599" target="_blank">00:26:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a couple kilobytes of RAM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a couple more kilobytes of RAM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1603" target="_blank">00:26:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you fast forward to where we are now, it's like we have terabytes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1607" target="_blank">00:26:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's like it's not just that it got twice as good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1610" target="_blank">00:26:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's that things got millions of times better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1613" target="_blank">00:26:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what happens with exponentials over a course of 20 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1617" target="_blank">00:26:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So we shouldn't think about 20 years from now is like what happens if these models are twice as good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1622" target="_blank">00:27:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We should think about what happens if these models are a million times smarter and faster than they are today, which is wild.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1628" target="_blank">00:27:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I we can't even think about what that means in the same way that someone working on computers in the 90s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1633" target="_blank">00:27:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think they could think about what would happen to society if a computer was a million times faster than what they were working with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1640" target="_blank">00:27:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's what happened. And so that's what we mean by the exponential is it's going to go bonkers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1645" target="_blank">00:27:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1646" target="_blank">00:27:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1647" target="_blank">00:27:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I got a couple. Well, I got one question, but it's kind of two parts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1652" target="_blank">00:27:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">The first part, when it comes to via coding, I have like two different workflows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1656" target="_blank">00:27:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I have one where I'm in my terminal and then I have one when I'm in VS code or cursor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1662" target="_blank">00:27:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Which workflow do you use?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1665" target="_blank">00:27:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you're using cloud code in a terminal, how often do you compact?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1671" target="_blank">00:27:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Because what I find is my functions will get a new name as the longer I vibe code or, you know, just things kind of go off the rails the longer I go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1682" target="_blank">00:28:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And if I compact, it still happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1684" target="_blank">00:28:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">If I create like a document to kind of guide it, I still have to, you know, get it back on track.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1690" target="_blank">00:28:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah. Great question. I do both. I often code with cloud code open in my terminal in VS code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1698" target="_blank">00:28:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'd say that like cloud code is doing most of the editing and I'm kind of reviewing the code as I go in VS code, which, you know, is not true vibe coding in the sense here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1709" target="_blank">00:28:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Or maybe I'm reviewing just the tests from it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1713" target="_blank">00:28:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I like to compact or just start a new session kind of whenever I get clawed to a good stopping point where it kind of feels like, okay, as a human programmer, like when would I kind of stop and take a break and maybe like go get lunch and then come back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1728" target="_blank">00:28:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">If I feel like I'm at that kind of stage, that's like a good time to compact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1732" target="_blank">00:28:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe I'll start off with having clawed find all the relevant files and make a plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1737" target="_blank">00:28:57.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I'll say, okay, like, you know, write all this into a document and then I'll compact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1742" target="_blank">00:29:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And that gets rid of a hundred K tokens that we took to create that plan and find all these files and boils it down to a few thousand tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1750" target="_blank">00:29:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, so one question is following up his previous question, which is have you used other tools along with cloud code to like increase your speed a little bit more like running multiple cloud codes together using get work trees and then like sort of merging few things or stack PR or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1773" target="_blank">00:29:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that something that you like personally follow or would advise to?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1776" target="_blank">00:29:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Second question is, um, how do you like, how do you very structurally and like in a very nice engineering, like, um, like way approach a part of the code base that you're not very familiar with, but you want to like ship a PR in it really fast and you want to do it in a really nice way and not wipe code it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1796" target="_blank">00:29:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, like what, what are the, what are your ways of like using cloud code to do help to both these things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1802" target="_blank">00:30:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1803" target="_blank">00:30:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, yeah, so I definitely use cloud code as well as cursor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1806" target="_blank">00:30:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and I'd say typically all like start things with cloud code and then I'll use cursor to fix things up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1813" target="_blank">00:30:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Or if I was like, if I have very specific changes, if I know exactly the change that I want to do to this file, I'll just do it myself, uh, with cursor and sort of target the exact lines that I know need to change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1824" target="_blank">00:30:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, the second part of your question was, um, oh yeah, like, uh, how to get spun up on a new part of the code base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1833" target="_blank">00:30:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, before I start trying to write the feature, I use clawed code to help me explore the code base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1839" target="_blank">00:30:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I might say like, tell me where in this code base off happens or, you know, where in this code base something happens, tell me similar features to this and like, have it tell me the file names, have it tell me the classes that I should look at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1853" target="_blank">00:30:53.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and then kind of use that to try to build up a mental picture to make sure that I can do this and not vibe code, make sure I can still get like, uh, a good sense of what's happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1863" target="_blank">00:31:03.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I go work on the feature with Claude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1865" target="_blank">00:31:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, thank you so

and answer other questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHWFF_pnqDk&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank
