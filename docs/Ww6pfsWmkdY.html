And so often that gets in the way of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=2864" target="_blank">00:47:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">decent person. Yeah. First and foremost, you're a good person and God helps you be that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=2870" target="_blank">00:47:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And we're serious about wrestling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=2872" target="_blank">00:47:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So a couple more questions. What's the role of family in wrestling? You mentioned your wife,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=2883" target="_blank">00:48:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">who I read, uh, turned you down when you asked her for a phone number,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=2888" target="_blank">00:48:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">said it's in the phone book. That's pretty smooth. Her story of that is that she didn't want me to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=2895" target="_blank">00:48:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">have to remember the number. And I say at this point, and I say, there's no way. And I remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=2901" target="_blank">00:48:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it very clearly like, Hey, it's in the phone book. And I was like, okay, she's blowing me off. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=2906" target="_blank">00:48:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">okay. But luckily anyway, here's the thing with family. I mean, we, we have great people in our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=2913" target="_blank">00:48:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">program. We have great parents. We have a culture of parents that that's part of the buzz. And this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=2920" target="_blank">00:48:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">class that you see wrestling right now, that's been here a year now, um, Lee Mirren, Costello</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=2926" target="_blank">00:48:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Warner, and then Lugo was a transfer and I'm forgetting somebody. I don't want to forget</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=2930" target="_blank">00:48:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">anybody, but, um, these parents are phenomenal and that's a different parental culture. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=2937" target="_blank">00:48:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">so the camera's dad is the same. And, and, um, so there's a lot of good there. And that's a big,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=2944" target="_blank">00:49:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that's a big, a big boom because how we talk to parents, we don't talk to parents to get along</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=2950" target="_blank">00:49:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">with them. We talk to parents to help them understand, you know, where we're at with their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=2955" target="_blank">00:49:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">sons. And when you can have a direct conversation with a parent who helping his son or her son,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=2962" target="_blank">00:49:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the mom helping her son to be accountable and to own it, then you can get a lot accomplished.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=2969" target="_blank">00:49:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what we've been able to do. And so you're solving problems like I talked about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=2972" target="_blank">00:49:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">earlier. Um, that's part of the family. The other part of the family is the coaches, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=2978" target="_blank">00:49:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">are like family. The other part of the family is the coaches, uh, significant others and wives</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=2985" target="_blank">00:49:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">are part of the family. And we fed, you know, we fed 40 guys and an entire coaching staff and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=2992" target="_blank">00:49:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">wives and their children here at Thanksgiving. And that equals 70 people. And it's, it's fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3000" target="_blank">00:50:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's fun. So a family means administration. Gary Barta, my, my athletic director gives us everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3008" target="_blank">00:50:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that we need to be successful. And he has an open mind for, for the sport of wrestling and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3014" target="_blank">00:50:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">wrestling is important in Iowa. So that's a no brainer, but not if you're not a wrestling guy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3019" target="_blank">00:50:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">but he sees we do it the right way. And so the commitment is there from him. If we were doofuses,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3025" target="_blank">00:50:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, he, the commitment wouldn't be there. So family is everybody's all in. I mean, it's from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3032" target="_blank">00:50:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the rest of us to the family. It goes back to what I said earlier about our people. Our people are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3036" target="_blank">00:50:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">great. Ryan Morningstar is great. Bobby Telford is great. Uh, Bobby Telford took over for a guy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3042" target="_blank">00:50:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">named Ben Burrhow, who is great. Um, our medical team is great. Dr. Westerman, Dr. Wolf, uh, Jesse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3049" target="_blank">00:50:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Donenworth, our athletic trainer is great. Um, uh, Terry Brands is great. Mariah Stickley and,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3057" target="_blank">00:50:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and Elise Owens, our managers are great. My daughter's a manager as well. It's great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3061" target="_blank">00:51:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, they're, they're hardworking young women. Our rest, our Hawkeye wrestling club is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3067" target="_blank">00:51:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">is where it needs to be in terms of how they help in their role. And now we have four women in there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3075" target="_blank">00:51:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and that's great. And, you know, at least one of their dads is super involved with us, but,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3082" target="_blank">00:51:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">um, and so it's one thing that I've learned is that you have to have that. And if you don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3090" target="_blank">00:51:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">have that, then you have to address it quickly. And those outliers, you know, let's solve that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3096" target="_blank">00:51:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">problem. Let's get it out in the open here. And if they're, you know, if it doesn't work out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3101" target="_blank">00:51:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not going to work out. That's a heck of a Thanksgiving dinner. Yeah. Next year. Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3106" target="_blank">00:51:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know if it'd be legal, but I'd have to check with our compliance and, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3111" target="_blank">00:51:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">they'd have to vet you. You could come, you can come and see what it's all about. This room is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3116" target="_blank">00:51:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">full. Oh man. Well, yeah, I'll be back next year then. All right. Awesome. Last question. In 2014,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3124" target="_blank">00:52:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I watched this video four years ago, uh, of you competing in, I believe your first swim meet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3133" target="_blank">00:52:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">against your brother, Terry. Uh, and you came out victorious. Not really. Okay. So let's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3141" target="_blank">00:52:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I won the race. Here's what happened. I had researched this thing because I'm, that's how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3148" target="_blank">00:52:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I am. You practice. No, I didn't. But I researched it in swimming. If you flinch on that starter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3154" target="_blank">00:52:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">block, it's a false start. You can't twitch a finger. And because they would be doing that to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3160" target="_blank">00:52:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">get their buddy to move or the guy next to him, you know, so you have to be rock solid. Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3165" target="_blank">00:52:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">when we went, Terry was leaning forward as the gun was going off. So he's moving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3170" target="_blank">00:52:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I was like, no, no, no. False start. No, no, no, no. And he couldn't hear me. He was already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3175" target="_blank">00:52:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in the water. And so he took off like a bat out of, you know, where for the end of the pool and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3180" target="_blank">00:53:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">couldn't hear me and got to the end of the pool. And it was a down and back. Well, that's a hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3185" target="_blank">00:53:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">thing to do with a guy with no body fat. And so he burned a lot of energy and he come up on that end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3191" target="_blank">00:53:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of the pool. And he was like, where's, where's the X. He didn't see me. And so we stopped him</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3195" target="_blank">00:53:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and then he came back and then we went another one and I beat him. Um, but it's the only time that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3202" target="_blank">00:53:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, I would say that he was tuckered out and that's the reason why. And, um, I'll also say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3207" target="_blank">00:53:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">this. We did a time where we timed my race, the one I won, and then we timed his first down to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3217" target="_blank">00:53:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">wall. And then we timed his, the actual race where once he hit the wall, we timed him on the way back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3223" target="_blank">00:53:43.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and he'd beat me. Now, how's that for being a honest, that's pretty honest, accountable person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3232" target="_blank">00:53:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm going to tell you something else getting in those shorts, those swimsuits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3235" target="_blank">00:53:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">That's impressive. They are tight. Yeah. So is there outside of wrestling, is there a thing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3243" target="_blank">00:54:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Terry got the better of you? I mean, I guess this could count as one, uh, that you're still really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3249" target="_blank">00:54:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">bitter about that. You need to avenge. I mean, that's passed. I mean, we, he's got an UNO title.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6pfsWmkdY&t=3255" target="_blank">00:54:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We have UNO world championships.
