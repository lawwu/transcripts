So let's start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">by just dissecting the various parts of a prompt that we might expect to see for a use case like RAG.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So our typical prompt for RAG or retrieval augmented generation will include rules for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the LLM and this is you know this you will see in most prompts if not all. This part of the prompt sets up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the behavior of the LLM that is how it should be responding to user queries, what sort of personality it should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">be taking on, what it should be focusing on when it is responding, any particular rules or boundaries that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we want to set and really what we're trying to do here is just to simply provide as much information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">as possible to the LLM about what we're doing. We just want to give the LLM context as to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">place that it finds itself in because now LLM has no idea where it is, it's just is a it takes in some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">information and spits out information. If the only information it receives is from the users you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">user query it has you know it doesn't know the context what is the application that it is within,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">what is its objective, what is its aim, what are the boundaries. All of this we need to just assume</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the LLM has absolutely no idea about because it truly does not. So as much context as we can provide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's important that we don't overdo it. We see this all the time people will over prompt an LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to be concise you don't want fluff and in general every single part of your prompt the more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">concise and less fluffy you can make it the better. Now those rules or instructions are typically in system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">prompt of your LLM. Now the second one is context which is RAG specific. The context refers to some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of external information that you are feeding into your LLM. We may have received this information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">from like a web search, database, query or quite often in this case of RAG it's a vector database. This</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">external information that external information that we provide is essentially the RA, retrieval augmentation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of RAG. We are augmenting the knowledge of our LLM which the knowledge of our LLM is contained within</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the LLM model weights. We're augmenting that knowledge with some external knowledge. That's what we're doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">here. Now for chat LLMs this context is typically placed within a conversational context within the user</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">or assistant messages and with more recent models it can also be placed within tool and messages as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Then we have the question. It's pretty straightforward. This is the query from the user. This is more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">as it's usually a user message of course. There might be some additional formatting around this. You might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">add a little bit of extra context or you might add some additional instructions if you find that your LLM</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes veers off the rules that you've set within the system prompt. You might you know append or prefix</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">something here but for the most part it's probably just going to be the user's input. And finally so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">these are all the inputs for our prompt. Here is going to be the output that we get. So the answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">from the assistant. Again I mean that's not even specific to RAG. It's just what you would expect in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">chat LLM or any LL. And of course that would be an assistant message. So putting all of that together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.560</a></span> | <span class="t">an actual prompt so you can see everything we have here. So we have the rules for our prompt here. The instructions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">we're just saying okay answer the question based on the context below. If you cannot answer the question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">using the information as with I don't know. Then we have some context here. Okay in this scenario that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">context that we're feeding in here because it's the first message we might put into the system prompt. But that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">may also be turned around. Okay if you if you for example have an agent you might have your question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">up here before the context. And then that would be coming from a user message. And then this context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">would follow the question and be recognized as a tool message. It would be fed in that way as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It kind of depends on on what sort of structure you're going for there. But you can do either. You can feed it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">into the system message if it's less conversational. Whereas if it's more conversation we might feed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it in as a tool message. Okay and then we have a user query which is here. And then we'd have the AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">answer. Okay and obviously that would be generated here. Okay so let's switch across to the code. We're in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the Langchain course repo notebook's 03 prompts. I'm just going to open this in Colab. Okay let's scroll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">down and we'll start just by installing the prerequisites. Okay so we just have the various</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">libraries again. As I mentioned before Langsmith is optional. You don't need to install it but if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">would like to see your traces and everything in Langsmith then I would recommend doing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you are using Langsmith you will need to enter your API key here. Again if you're not using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Langsmith you don't need to enter anything here. You just skip that cell. Okay cool. And let's jump into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the basic prompting then. So we're going to start with this prompt and so use query based on the question</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">below. So we're just structuring what we just saw in code. And we're going to be using the chat prompt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">template because generally speaking we're using chat LLMs in most cases nowadays. So we have our chat prompt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">template and that is going to contain a list of messages. System message to begin with which is just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">going to contain this and we're feeding in the context within that there. And we have our user query here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay so we'll run this and if we take a look here we haven't specified what our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">input variables are. Okay but we can see that we have query and we have context up here. Right so we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">see that okay these are the input variables we just haven't explicitly defined them here. So let's just confirm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">with this that line chain did pick those up and we can see that it did. So it has context and query as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">our input variables for the prompt template that we just defined. Okay so we can also see the structure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of our templates. Let's have a look. Okay so we can see that within messages here we have a system message</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">prompt template. The way that we define this you can see here that we have from messages and this will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">consume various different structures. So you can see here that it has a from messages is a sequence of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">message like representation. So we could pass in a system prompt template object and then a user prompt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">template object or we can just use a tuple like this and this actually defines okay this system this is a user and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you could also do assistant or tool messages and stuff here as well using the same structure. And then we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">can look in here and of course that is being translated into the system message prompt template and human</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">message prompt template. Okay we have our input variables in there and then we have the template too. Okay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">now let's continue we'll see here why what I just said. So we're importing our system message prompt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">template and human message prompt template and you can see we're using the same from messages method here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">right and you can see it's still sequence of message like representation it's just you know what that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">actually means it can vary right. So here we have system message prompt template from template prompt here from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">template query you know there's various ways that you might want to do this it just depends on how explicit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to be. Generally speaking I think for myself I would prefer that we stick with the objects</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">themselves and be explicit but it is definitely a little harder to pass when you're when you're reading</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this so I understand why you might also prefer this it's definitely cleaner and it is it does look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">simpler so it just depends I suppose on preference. Okay so you can see again that this is exactly the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">okay with chat prompt template and it contains this and this okay you probably want to see the exact output</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">so as messages. Okay exactly the same as what I output before. Cool so we have all that let's see how we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">would invoke our LLM with these we're going to be using 4.0 mini again we do need our API key so enter that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and we'll just initialize our LLM we are going with a low temperature here so less randomness or less</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">creativity and you know in in many cases this is actually what I would be doing. The reason</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in this scenario that we're going with low temperature is we're doing RAG and if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">remember before we scroll up a little bit here our template says answer the user's query based on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">context below if you cannot answer the question using the provided answer information answer with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know right so just from reading that we know that we want our LLM to be as truthful and accurate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">as possible so a more creative LLM is going to struggle with that and is more likely to hallucinate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">whereas a low creativity or low temperature LLM will probably stick with the rules a little better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">so again it depends on your use case you know if you're creative writing you might want to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=770" target="_blank">00:12:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">with a higher temperature there but for things like RAG where the information being output should be accurate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and truthful it's important I think that we keep temperature low okay I talk about that a little bit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">here so of course a lower temperature of zero makes the LLM's output more deterministic which in theory</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">should lead to less hallucination okay so we're gonna go with lcell again here this is for those of you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that use linechain in the past this is equivalent to an LLM chain object so our prompt template is being fed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.960</a></span> | <span

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">so the linechain experts a little piece of information now most LLMs would have not been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">trained on the

that context okay so we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">feeding that into that pipeline that we defined here all right so when we invoke that it's automatically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">going to take query and context and actually feed it into our prompt template okay if we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">want to we can also be a little more explicit so you you will probably see me doing this throughout the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">course because I do like to be explicit with everything to be honest and you'll probably see me doing this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">okay and this is doing the same thing or you'll see it will in a moment this is doing the exact same thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">again this is again this is just a also thing so all I'm doing in this scenario is I'm saying okay take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=920" target="_blank">00:15:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">from

target="_blank">00:15:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">okay so this is doing the exact same thing the reason that we might want to write this is mainly for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">clarity to be honest just too explicit say okay these are the inputs because otherwise we don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">really have them in the code other than within our original prompts up here which is not super clear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">so I think it's usually a good idea to just be more explicit with these things and of course</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">if you decide you're going to modify things a little bit let's say you modify this to input down the line you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">can still feed

target="_blank">00:16:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">or if you would like to just modify that you need to lowercase it on the way in or something you can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">so you have that I'll just uh redefine that actually and we'll invoke again</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPeOAOvKFHE&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">okay and we see that this is the
