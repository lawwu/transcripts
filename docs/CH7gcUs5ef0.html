But I'm not, so I'm not gonna say that. All right. I did a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH7gcUs5ef0&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">research here.

So, that's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH7gcUs5ef0&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">0.5% of global financial assets.

On the other hand, it's really only been a financial asset for, I don't know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH7gcUs5ef0&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">five years, legitimately.

This is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH7gcUs5ef0&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in the U.S. Gen X holds 26%. Millennials have less than 5% of financial assets. Obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH7gcUs5ef0&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">eventually, a lot of that money from the boomers, if they don't spend it all and go to Vegas</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH7gcUs5ef0&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and blow everything before their kids get it, a lot of that money will be passed on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH7gcUs5ef0&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to the next generation. But it's going to happen at a glacial pace. It's going to take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH7gcUs5ef0&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a while. And obviously, you have the fact that millennials are coming up, and they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH7gcUs5ef0&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be in their peak earnings years, and they're going to be saving more. So, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH7gcUs5ef0&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">could divert some more money to crypto.

I would actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH7gcUs5ef0&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.720</a></span> | <span class="t">be far more worried about other asset classes before I got to worry about the stock market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH7gcUs5ef0&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Gold is the easiest one, right? I actually think millennial/Gen Z digital gold is probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH7gcUs5ef0&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the most compelling investment thesis for Bitcoin at the moment. So, gold is $9-10 trillion,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH7gcUs5ef0&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">depending on how you count it.

So, could you see things like stablecoins take the place of money markets, or at least</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH7gcUs5ef0&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">for young people?
