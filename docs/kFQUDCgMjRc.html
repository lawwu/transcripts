You've talked about this before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">What were, for you personally, psychologically, some difficult moments in your childhood?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll answer that question in a slightly different way, which is that I think when you grow up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in a household that's defined by physical abuse and psychological abuse,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you're hypervigilant all the time. And so it's actually easier for me to point to moments where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I was happy or I felt compassion or I felt safe. Otherwise, every moment, I'll give you a couple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of examples. I was thinking about this a while ago. There was a tree outside of my apartment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">where we lived when I was growing up, and my father sometimes would make me go outside</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to take the tree branch that he would hit me with. And so you can imagine if you're a 10,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">11-year-old kid and you have to deal with that, what do you do? Well, a hypervigilant child</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">learns how to basically estimate the strength of these branches. How far can he go before it breaks?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to estimate his anger and estimate the effective strength of branches and bring back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">something. Because I remember these moments where if it was, he would look at it and then he would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">make me go out again and get it, get a different one. Or there was a certain belt that he wore</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that had this kind of belt buckle that stuck out. And you just wanted to make sure if that was the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that you were going to get hit by, that it wasn't the buckle facing out because that really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">hurt. And so you became hyperaware of which part of the buckle was facing out versus facing in in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">those moments. And there are hundreds of these little examples, which essentially I would say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the through line is that you're just so on edge. And you walk into this house and you're just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">basically trying to get to the point where you leave the house. And so in that microcosm of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">growing up, any moment that's not like that is seared in my memory in a way that I just can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">describe to a person. I'll give you an example. I volunteered when I was in grade five or six,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't remember which it was, in the kindergarten of my school. And I would just go and the teacher</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">would ask you to clean things up. And at the end of that grade five year, she took me and two other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">kids to Dairy Queen. And I'd never gone to a restaurant, literally, because we just didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">have the money. And I remember the first time I tasted this Dairy Queen meal, it was like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">hamburger, fries, a Coke, and a Blizzard. And I was like, "What is this?" And I felt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">so special, because you're getting something that most people would take for granted. Oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a Sunday or I'm really busy, let me go take my kid to fast food. I think that until I left</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">high school, I think, and this is not just specific to me, but a lot of other people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you're in this hypervigilant loop, punctuated with these incredibly visceral moments of compassion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=277" target="_blank">00:04:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">by other people. A different example, we had such a strict budget and we didn't have a car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I was responsible with my mom to always go shopping. And so I learned very early on how to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">look for coupons, how to buy things that were on sale or special. And we had a very basic diet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">because you have to budget this thing really precisely. But the end of every year where I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">lived, there was a large grocery chain called Loblaws. And Loblaws would discount a cheesecake</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">from 7.99 to 4.99. And my parents would buy that once a year. And we probably did that six or seven</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">times. And you can't imagine how special we felt, myself, my two sisters. We would sit there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we would watch the New Year's Eve celebration on TV, we would cut this cheesecake into five pieces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=341" target="_blank">00:05:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It felt like everything. So that's sort of how my existence when I was at that age is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">for better or for worse, that's how I remember it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">The hypervigilant loop, is that still with you today? What are the echoes of that still with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you today, the good and the bad? If you put yourself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in the mind of a young child, the thing that that does to you is at a very core basic level,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it says you're worthless. Because if you can step outside of that and you think about any child in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the world, they don't deserve to go through that. And at some point, by the way, I should tell you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't blame my parents anymore. It was a process to get there, but I feel like they did the best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">they could. And they suffered their own issues and enormous pressures and stresses. And so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I've really, for the most part, forgiven them. >> How did you, sorry to interrupt,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">let go of that blame? >> That was a really long process where,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say the first 35 years of my life, I compartmentalized and I avoided all of those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">memories. And I sought external validation. Going back to this self-worth idea, if you're taught as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQUDCgMjRc&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a child that you're worthless, because why would somebody do these things to you?
