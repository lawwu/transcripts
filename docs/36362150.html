class="t">And yeah, I'm excited when I think about the idea of teaching my son Latin, especially because, you know, I did, my mother's bilingual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I grew up in a household where French was spoken frequently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1622" target="_blank">00:27:02.200</a></span> | <span

href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1629" target="_blank">00:27:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I actually learned Spanish in school, but because those romantic languages were structured differently, I still see so many gaps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1639" target="_blank">00:27:19.940</a></span> | <span class="t">In the way that I communicate, even though I excelled in English and I did wonderfully in college and, you know, they showed my essays too, but at the end of the day, I still have those gaps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1648" target="_blank">00:27:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm wondering what, um, truly understanding Latin will do for students in the future and if you have any thoughts on that, especially with, with the new technology and, and what we're seeing on the horizon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1662" target="_blank">00:27:42.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, you know, you might not know this, but Latin was in all schools in until the 1950s, um, maybe early sixties.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1674" target="_blank">00:27:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And since then we have seen a decrease in the quality of education throughout America.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1682" target="_blank">00:28:02.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and the Latin was one of our original ways to learn, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1691" target="_blank">00:28:11.900</a></span> | <span class="t">We learned language, all the founding fathers learned Latin, all the, um, you know, original preachers that we listened to, they all learned Latin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1701" target="_blank">00:28:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And all these scholars that we now study, even Mark Twain and probably Shakespeare, you know, they all studied Latin and they were these highly intelligent beings that changed our world for the better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1714" target="_blank">00:28:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And we took Latin out of schools and it's possibly because of the religious connection is possibly because people thought it was too hard, but when we did or that it was dead, it was not necessary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1728" target="_blank">00:28:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think just incorporating Latin for four or five years in a student's life gives them an edge to all those students who are not doing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1752" target="_blank">00:29:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">It, it, it, it increases your brain ability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1755" target="_blank">00:29:15.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, there was a study I read once where they put Latin into a Chicago public school and they did absolutely nothing else, but taught these kids Latin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1766" target="_blank">00:29:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And that school, it's test scores increased to the next year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1772" target="_blank">00:29:32.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So they, they have seen very, um, decisive increases in the ability of a student thinker when they are taught Latin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1785" target="_blank">00:29:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's, I, I think it's overall like your whole brain functions better when you can use Latin as a puzzle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1793" target="_blank">00:29:53.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Cause you know, a lot of times we're like, oh, it's a language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1795" target="_blank">00:29:55.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it's this big puzzle that when you know the pieces of the puzzle and you can put it together, your brain can then do that in many different aspects and very, very quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1806" target="_blank">00:30:06.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so I don't think it's just in writing that we can see the improvement or in English grammar or how we present ourselves to others, but across the board, the, uh, the ability of a child who has learned Latin is increased like tenfold.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1824" target="_blank">00:30:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say, um, by just studying, um, by just studying and being able to see those patterns that I believe God put out there for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1832" target="_blank">00:30:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1833" target="_blank">00:30:33.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I, I, that was going to ask you, do you think it is the, um, the discipline of studying, of memorizing, you know, paradigms and, and memorizing declensions and conjugations, or is it the finding of patterns?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1848" target="_blank">00:30:48.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Or is it just that it is a structure and it has a structure, the language has a structure that you discover as you learn it more and more that maybe wires your brain to look for structure and pattern in everything else and find it and then learn it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.340</a></span> | <span

class="t">So I kind of think it's all of those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1872" target="_blank">00:31:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, um, when you're studying Latin, you're learning how to study, um, you're learning how to memorize and you're learning to see patterns and then you will see those patterns in other aspects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1888" target="_blank">00:31:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, like when I opened the, um, I think the Apologia Biology book in the first chapter, there was a Latin word.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1897" target="_blank">00:31:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I was like, oh, look, that's the exact Latin word that we've been using.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1900" target="_blank">00:31:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, the quality of over quantity, which is for adjectives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1906" target="_blank">00:31:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I've seen that repeated in other aspects where we have quantity, the number of things over quality, the, the, how it should be, um, the explanation of something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1917" target="_blank">00:31:57.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not just in Latin, but I think I've seen it in logic and in science as we've been studying those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=1924" target="_blank">00:32:04.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So overall, I think the combination of how you study Latin will then snowball into every other aspect of how you study and how you see and how you pull apart words.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="t">Um, and then in the summer, um, then in the summer, if the kids miss that, I have a 40 week summer program, it's called Jam with Latin summer study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2167" target="_blank">00:36:07.480</a></span> |

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2189" target="_blank">00:36:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not sure how many vocabulary words are in that, but probably 60 to 80 as well that you would have the flashcards made.</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:36:37.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and that actually helps to reduce the amount of vocabulary words you have to focus on when you start class a, and that is about 40 to 45 days of, of set work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/36362150/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=2214" target="_blank">00:36:54.640</a></span> | <span
