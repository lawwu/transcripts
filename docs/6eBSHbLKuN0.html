QuadCode is a new kind of AI assistant, and there's been different generations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.280</a></span> | <span class="t">of AI assistants for coding. Most of them have been about completing, you know, like a line</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">at a time, completing a few lines of code at a time. QuadCode is not for that, it's fully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.280</a></span> | <span class="t">agentic. So it's meant for building features, for writing entire functions, entire files,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">fixing entire bugs at the same time. And what's kind of cool about QuadCode is it works with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">all of your tools, and you don't have to change out your workflow, you don't have to swap everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to start using it. So whatever IDE you use, if you use VS code, or if you use Xcode, or if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you use JetBrains IDEs, there's some people at Anthropic that you can't pry them from their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">cold, dead hands, but they use QuadCode. Because QuadCode works with every single IDE, every terminal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">out there. It will work locally, over remote SSH, over Tmux, whatever environment you're in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you can run it. It's general purpose, and this is something where if you haven't used these kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">free-form coding assistants in the past, it can be kind of hard to figure out how to get started,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">because you open it up, and you just see a prompt bar, and you might wonder, like, what do I do with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">this? What do I type in? It's a power tool, so you can use it for a lot of things, but also because it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">can do so much, we don't try to guide you towards a particular workflow. Because really, you should be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to use it however you want as an engineer. As you open up QuadCode for the first time, there's a few</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">things that we recommend doing to get your environment set up, and these are pretty straightforward. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">run Terminal Setup, this will give you Shift+Enter for new lines, so you don't have to do, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">backslashes to enter new lines. This is, you know, it makes it a little bit nicer to use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Do /theme to set light mode, or dark mode, or Daltonize themes. You can do /install GitHub app. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">today, we announced a GitHub app where you can add, mention, Claude on any GitHub issue or pull request.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So, to install it, just run this command in your terminal. You can customize the set of allowed tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that you can use, so you're not prompted for it every time. This is pretty convenient. For stuff that I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">prompted about a bunch, I'll definitely customize it in this way, so I don't have to accept it every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">time. And something that I actually do is, for a lot of my prompts, I won't hand-type them into QuadCode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're on macOS, you can go into your system settings under accessibility as dictation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and you can enable it. And so, something I do is you just hit, like, that dictation key twice,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and you can just speak your prompt. And it helps a lot to have specific prompts. So, this is actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty awesome. You can just talk to QuadCode, like you would another engineer, and you don't have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">type a lot of code. So, when you're starting out with QuadCode, it's so freeform, and it can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">everything. What do you start with? The thing I recommend above everything else is starting with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">CodeBase Q&A. So, just asking questions to your CodeBase. This is something that we teach new hires at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Anthropic. So, on the first day, in technical onboarding, you learn about QuadCode, you download</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it, you get it set up, and then you immediately start asking questions about the CodeBase. And in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">past, when you were doing technical onboarding, it's something that taxes the team a lot, right? You have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to ask other engineers on the team questions. You have to look around the code, and this takes a while. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">have to figure out how to use the tools. This takes a long time. With QuadCode, you can just ask QuadCode,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">and it'll explore the code base. It'll answer these kind of questions. And so, at Anthropic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">onboarding used to take about two or three weeks for technical hires. It's now about two or three days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">What's also kind of cool about Q&A is we don't do any sort of indexing. So, there's no remote</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">database with your code. We don't upload it anywhere. Your code stays vocal. We do not train generative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">models on the code. So, it's there. You control it. There's no indices or anything like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And what that means is also there's no setup. So, you start Quad, you download it. You start it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no indexing. You don't have to wait. You can just use it right away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a technical talk. So, I'm going to show some very specific prompts and very specific code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">samples that you can use and hopefully improve and up-level your QuadCode experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So, some kind of questions that you can ask is, you know, like, how is this particular piece of code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">used? Or, how do I instantiate this thing? And the QuadCode, it won't just do like a text search and try to answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">this. It'll often go a level deeper and it'll try to find examples of how is this class instantiated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How is it used? And it'll give you a much deeper answer. So, something that you would get out of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">wiki or documentation instead of just like command F. Something that I do a lot also is ask it about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">git history. So, for example, you know, why does this function have 15 arguments? And why are the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">arguments named this weird way? And this is something I bet in all of our code bases, you have some function</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">like this or some class like this. And CloudCode can look through git history and it'll look to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">figure out how did these arguments get introduced and who introduced them and what was the situation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">What are the issues that those commits linked to? And it'll look through all this and summarize it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And you don't have to tell it that in all these, in all this detail. You just ask it. So, just say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">look through git history and it'll know to do this. The reason it knows, by the way, is not because we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">prompted it to. There's nothing in the system prompt about looking through git history. It knows it because the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">model is awesome. And if you tell it to use git, it'll know how to use git. So, we're lucky to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">building on such a good model. I often ask about GitHub issues. So, you know, it can use web fetch and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it can fetch issues and look up context on issues too. And this is pretty awesome. And this is something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that I do every single Monday in our weekly stand up.

And QuadCode looks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=429" target="_blank">00:07:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the log.

So, yeah, that's tip number one. For people that have not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=442" target="_blank">00:07:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">used QuadCode before, if you're just showing it to someone for the first time, onboarding your team,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the thing we definitely recommend is start with CodeBase Q&A. Don't start by using fancy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">tools. Don't start by editing code. Just start by asking questions about the CodeBase. And that'll teach</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">people how to prompt. And it'll start teaching them this boundary of like what can CloudCode do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">What is it capable of versus what do you need to hold its hand with a little bit more?

Once you're pretty comfortable with Q&A, you can dive into editing code. This is the next thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And the cool thing about any sort of agentic, you know, like using LLM in an agentic way is you give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it tools and it's just like magical. It figures out how to use the tools. And with CloudCode, we give it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a pretty small set of tools. It's not a lot. And so it has a tool to edit files. It has a tool to run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">bash commands. It has a tool to search files. And it'll string these together to explore the code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">brainstorm, and then finally make edits. And you don't have to prompt it specifically to use this tool and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">this tool and this tool. You just say, you know, do this thing, and it'll figure out how to do it. It'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">string it together in the right way. That makes sense for CloudCode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of ways to use this. Something I like to do sometimes is before having Cloud</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">jump in to write code, I'll ask it to brainstorm a little bit or make a plan. This is something we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">highly recommend. And something I see sometimes is people, you know, they take CloudCode and they ask it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, implement this enormous like 3000 line feature. And sometimes it gets this right on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the first shot. But sometimes what happens is the thing that it builds is not at all the thing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you wanted. And the easiest way to get the result you want is ask it to think first. So brainstorm ideas,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">make a plan, run it by me, ask for approval before you write code. And you don't have to use plan mode,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't have to use any special tools to do this. All you have to do is ask Cloud. And it'll know to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So just say, before you write code, make a plan. That's it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">This is also, I want to think with this one, this commit push VR, this is a really common</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">incantation that I use.

Again, we're not system prompting it to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It just knows how to do this. The model is good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">As you get a little bit more advanced, you're going to want to start to plug in your team's tools. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=600" target="_blank">00:10:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">this is where Cloud Code starts to really shine. And there's generally two kinds of tools. So one is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">bash tools. And an example of this, I just made up this like Burley CLI. This isn't a real thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can say use the CLI to do something. And you can tell Cloud Code about this. And you can tell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it to use, for example, like dash dash help to figure out how to use it. And this is efficient. If you find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">yourself using it a lot, you can also dump this into your Cloud MD, which we'll talk about in a bit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">so Cloud can remember this across sessions. But this is a common pattern we follow at Anthropic and we see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">external customers use too. And same thing with MCP. Cloud Code can use bash tools. It can use MCP</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">tools. So, you know, just tell it about the tools. And you can add the MCP tool and you can tell it how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to use it. And it'll just start using it. And this is extremely powerful because when you start to use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">code on a new code base, you can just give it all of your tools, all the tools your team already uses</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">for this code base. And Cloud Code can use it on your behalf.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a few common workflows. And this is the one that I talked about already. So kind of do a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">bit of exploration, do a little bit of planning, and ask me for confirmation before you start to write</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.040</a></span> | <span class="t">code. These other two on the right are extremely powerful. When Cloud has some way to check its work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">so for example, by writing unit tests or screenshotting in Puppeteer or screenshotting the iOS</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">simulator, then it can iterate. And this is incredible because if you give it, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">a mock and you say build this web UI, it'll get it pretty good. But if you let it iterate two or three</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">times, often it gets it almost perfect. So the trick is give it some sort of tool that it can use for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">feedback to check its work. And then based on that, it will iterate by itself and you're going to get a much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">better result. So whatever your domain is, if it's unit test or integration test or screenshots for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">apps or web or anything, just give it a way to see its result and it'll iterate and get better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So these are the next steps. Teach Cloud how to use your tools and figure out the right workflow. If you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">want Cloud to jump into code, if you want it to brainstorm a little bit, make a plan, if you want it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">iterate, kind of have some sense of that so you know how to prompt Cloud to do what you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">As you go deeper, beyond tools, you want to start to give Cloud more context. And the more context,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the smarter the decisions will be. Because as an engineer working in a code base, you have a ton</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">of context in your head about your systems and all the history and everything else. So there's different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">ways to give this to Cloud. And as you give Cloud more context, it'll do better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">There's different ways to do this. The simplest one is what we call Cloud.MD. And Cloud.MD is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">special file name. The simplest place to put it is in the project root. So the same directory you start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Cloud in, put a Cloud.MD in there. And that'll get automatically read into context at the start of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">every session. And essentially, the first user turn will include the Cloud.MD. You can also have a local</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Cloud.MD. And this one, you don't usually check into source control. So Cloud.MD, you should check into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">source control, share with your team so that you can write it once and share it with your team. This one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't check in. It's just for you. The kinds of things you put in Cloud.MD, it's like common bash commands,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=798" target="_blank">00:13:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">common MCP tools, architectural decisions, important files, anything that you would kind of typically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">need to know in order to work in this codebase. Try to keep it pretty short, because if it gets too long,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it's just going to use up a bunch of context. And it's usually not that useful. So just try to keep it as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">short as you can. And for example, in our codebase, we have common bash commands, we have a style guide,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we have a few core files, kind of things like that.

So these are the Cloud.MDs that will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=832" target="_blank">00:13:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">get pulled in automatically. But then also, you can put Cloud.MDs in nested directories,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=837" target="_blank">00:13:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and those will get put, those will get automatically pulled when Cloud works in those directories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, if you're, you know, a company, maybe you want a Cloud.MD that's shared across all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the different codebases, and you want to manage it on behalf of your users, and you can put in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=850" target="_blank">00:14:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">enterprise route, and that'll get pulled in automatically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a ton of ways to pull in context. I actually had a lot of trouble putting this slide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">together just to communicate the breadth of ways you can do this. But Cloud.MD is pulled in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">automatically. You can also use slash commands. So this is .quad slash commands, and this can be in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">your home directory, or it can be checked into your project. And this is for slash commands. And over here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we have a few examples of the slash commands that we have in Cloud Code itself. And so, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're in the Cloud Code repo, and you see issues getting labeled, that's actually this workflow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">running here. It's labeled GitHub issues. And we have a GitHub action running, the same one we talked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">about this morning, where Cloud Code will run this command, and it's just a slash command. It'll run,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and it'll label the issues so humans don't have to. It just saves us a bunch of time. And of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you can add mention files to pull them into context. And like I said before, Quad.MDs in a nested</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">directory get pulled in when Quad works in that directory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=913" target="_blank">00:15:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So give Quad more context, and it's definitely worth taking the time to tune context. You can run it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">through a prompt improver. Consider who the context is for. If you want to pull it in every time, if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">want to pull it in on demand, if you want to share it with a team, if it's a personal preference,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">definitely take the time to tune it. This will improve performance dramatically, if you do it right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">As you get more advanced, you're going to want to think about this a little bit more, this kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">hierarchy of different ways to pull in everything. So like not just Quad.MD, but also config and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=951" target="_blank">00:15:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of everything about Quad you can pull in in this hierarchical way. So projects are specific to your Git repo,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and this you can check in, or you can make it just for you. You can also have global configs that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.640</a></span> | <span class="t">across all your projects, or you can have enterprise policies. And this is essentially a global config</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=969" target="_blank">00:16:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that you roll out for all of your employees, everyone on your team automatically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And this slide is like pretty information dense, but the point is this applies to a lot of stuff. So you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">can do this for slash commands, you can do it for permissions. So for example, if you have a bash command</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=983" target="_blank">00:16:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that you would run for all your employees, like all your employees use this like test command, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you can actually just check it into this enterprise policies file. And then any employee, when they run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">this command, it will be auto approved, which is pretty convenient. And you can also use this to block</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.720</a></span> | <span class="t">commands. So for example, let's say there's a URL that should never be fetched. Just add it to this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">config, and that will make it so an employee cannot override it. And that URL can never be fetched. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty convenient both to unblock people and also just to keep your code base safe. And then same thing for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">MCP servers, have a MCP JSON file, check it into the code base. That way, anytime someone runs quad</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">code in your code base, they'll be prompted to install the MCP servers and share it with the team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're not sure which of these to use, this is like a kind of an insane matrix because we support a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of stuff and engineer workflows are very flexible and every company is different. So we kind of want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">support everything. So if you're not sure how to get started, I would recommend start with shared</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">project context. You write this once and then you share it with everyone on the team, and you get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">this kind of network effect where someone does a little bit of work and everyone on the team benefits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1050" target="_blank">00:17:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of tools built into Quad to manage this. So as an example, if you run slash memory,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you can see all the different memory files that are getting pulled in. So maybe I have an enterprise</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">policy, I have my user memory, I have project Quad MD, and then maybe there's a nested Quad MD that's only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.400</a></span> | <span class="t">pulled in for certain directories. And then similarly, when you do slash memory, you can edit particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.880</a></span> | <span class="t">memory files. When you type pound sign to remember something, you can pick which memory you wanted to go to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1081" target="_blank">00:18:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, that's the next step. Take the time to configure Quad MD, MCP servers, all the stuff that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">your team uses so that you can use it once, configure it once, and then share it with everyone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">An example of this is in our apps repo for Anthropic. This is like the repo that we have all of our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">web and apps code in.

This is a talk about pro tips. I just want to take a quick interlude to talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">some common key bindings that people may not know. It's very hard to build for terminal. It's also very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1134" target="_blank">00:18:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">fun. It feels like rediscovering this new design language. But something about terminals, it's extremely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1140" target="_blank">00:19:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">minimal. And so sometimes it's hard to discover these key bindings. And here's just a quick reference</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1145" target="_blank">00:19:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">sheet. So anytime, you can hit shift tab to accept edits. And this switches you into auto accept edits</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1151" target="_blank">00:19:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">mode. So bash commands still need approval, but edits are auto accepted. And you can always ask Quad to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1156" target="_blank">00:19:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">undo them later. For example, I'll do this if I know Quad's on the right track or if it's writing unit tests and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1161" target="_blank">00:19:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">iterating on tests. I'll usually just switch into auto accept mode so I don't have to okay every single edit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Any time you want Cloud to remember something, so for example, if it's not using a tool correctly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and you wanted to use it correctly from then on, just type the pound sign and then tell it what to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1177" target="_blank">00:19:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">remember and it'll remember it.

If you ever want to drop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">down to bash mode, so just run a bash command, you can hit the exclamation mark and type in your command.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">That'll run locally, but that also goes into the context window. So Cloud will see it on the next turn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is pretty good for long running commands if you know exactly what you want to do or any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1197" target="_blank">00:19:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">command that you want to get into context.

It's not going to corrupt the session.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1212" target="_blank">00:20:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not going to mess anything up. So maybe Quad is doing a file edit. I'll hit escape. I'll tell it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what to do differently. Or maybe it suggested a 20 line edit and I'm like, actually 19 of these lines look perfect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1222" target="_blank">00:20:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but one line you should change. I'll hit escape. I'll tell it that.

So yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you can build on top of this. You can do cool stuff. This is exactly the thing that Quad code uses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1279" target="_blank">00:21:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">It's exactly the same SDK. And so, for example, something you can do is Quad dash P. So this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1285" target="_blank">00:21:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the CLI SDK. You can pass a prompt. You can pass some allowed tools, which could include specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1292" target="_blank">00:21:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">batch commands. And you can tell it which format you want. So you might want JSON or you might want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">streaming JSON if you want to process this somehow. So this is awesome for building on. We use this in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">CI all the time. We use this for incident response. We use this in all sorts of pipelines. So really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">convenient. Just think of it as like a Unix utility. You give it a prompt. It gives you JSON. You can use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1313" target="_blank">00:21:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this in any way. You can pipe into it. You can pipe out of it. The piping is also pretty cool. So you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1322" target="_blank">00:22:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">use, like, for example, git status and pipe this in and, you know, use JQ to select the result. The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1328" target="_blank">00:22:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">combinations are endless. And it's sort of this new idea. It's like a super intelligent Unix utility.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1333" target="_blank">00:22:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we've barely scratched the surface of how to use this. We're just figuring this out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1337" target="_blank">00:22:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You can read from, like, a GCP bucket. Read, you know, like, a giant log and pipe it in and tell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1343" target="_blank">00:22:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Claude to figure out what's interesting about this log. You can fetch data from, like, the Sentry CLI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You can also pipe it in and have Claude do something with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1352" target="_blank">00:22:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">The final thing, and this is probably, like, the most advanced use case as we see, I'm sort of a Claude</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">normie. So I'll have usually, like, one Claude running at a time. And maybe I'll have, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1366" target="_blank">00:22:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">a few terminal tabs for a few different repos running at a time. When I look at power users</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">in and out of Anthropic, almost always they're going to have, like, SSH sessions. They'll have,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1376" target="_blank">00:22:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like, Tmux tunnels into their Claude sessions. They're going to have a bunch of checkouts of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">same repo so that they can run a bunch of Claude in parallel in that repo. Or they're using Git work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1385" target="_blank">00:23:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">trees to have some kind of isolation as they do this. And we're actively working on making this easier to use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1390" target="_blank">00:23:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But for now, like, these are some ideas for how to do more work in parallel with Claude. You can run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">as many sessions as you want.

I wanted to also leave some time for Q&A. So I think this is the last slide that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1410" target="_blank">00:23:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">have.

And, yeah, we'd love to answer any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1417" target="_blank">00:23:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1434" target="_blank">00:23:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1439" target="_blank">00:23:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there's a lot of tricky parts. I think one part that is especially tricky is the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1458" target="_blank">00:24:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that we do to make Bash commands safe. Bash is inherently pretty dangerous and it can change system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1464" target="_blank">00:24:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">state in unexpected ways. But at the same time, if you have to manually approve every single Bash command,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1471" target="_blank">00:24:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it's super annoying as an engineer.

And essentially the thing we landed on is there's some commands that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1490" target="_blank">00:24:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">are read-only. There's some static analysis that we do in order to figure out which commands can be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1494" target="_blank">00:24:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">combined in safe ways. And then we have this pretty complex tiered permission system so that you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1499" target="_blank">00:24:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">allow list and block list commands at different levels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1501" target="_blank">00:25:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Hi, Boris. You mentioned giving an image to cloud code, which made me wonder if there's some sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1510" target="_blank">00:25:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">multimodal functionality that I'm not aware of. Are you just pointing it at an image on the file system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1516" target="_blank">00:25:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">or something? Yeah, so cloud code is fully multimodal. It has been from the start. It's in a terminal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1521" target="_blank">00:25:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">so it's a little hard to discover. But yeah, you can take an image and just drag and drop it in. That'll work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You can give it a file path. That'll work. You can copy and paste the image in and that works too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'll use this pretty often for if I have like a mock of something, I'll just drag and drop in the mock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1539" target="_blank">00:25:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll tell it to implement it. I'll give it up to your server so it can iterate against it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1543" target="_blank">00:25:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, it's just fully automated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1545" target="_blank">00:25:45.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, hey, uh, why did you build a CLI tool instead of an IDE?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1552" target="_blank">00:25:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's a good question. I think there's probably two reasons. One is, uh, we started this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1559" target="_blank">00:25:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">at Anthropic. And at Anthropic, people use a broad range of IDEs. And some people use VS Code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1565" target="_blank">00:26:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">other people use Z, or Xcode, or Vim, or Emacs. And it was just hard to build something that works for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1571" target="_blank">00:26:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">everyone. And so terminal is just the common denominator. The second thing is at Anthropic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1577" target="_blank">00:26:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we're, uh, we see up close how fast the model is getting better. And so I think there's a good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1583" target="_blank">00:26:23.200</a></span> | <span class="t">chance that by the end of the year, people aren't using IDEs anymore. And so we want to get ready for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1588" target="_blank">00:26:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this future. And we want to avoid over-investing in UI and other layers on top, given that the way the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1594" target="_blank">00:26:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">models are progressing, it just, it may not be useful work pretty soon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1598" target="_blank">00:26:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, how much have you, I don't know if this is, is this on? How much have you used</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1607" target="_blank">00:26:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">cloud code for machine learning modeling and almost that AutoML experience?

Yeah, I think, I think the question was how much are we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">using cloud code for machine learning and modeling?

So both engineers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1624" target="_blank">00:27:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and researchers at Anthropic use cloud code every day. I think about 80% of people at Anthropic that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1631" target="_blank">00:27:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">are technical use cloud code every day. And hopefully you can see that in the product and kind of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eBSHbLKuN0&t=1635" target="_blank">00:27:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">amount of love and dog fooding we've put into it.
