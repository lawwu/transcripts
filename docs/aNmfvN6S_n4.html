We're able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to build module infrastructures and very complex infrastructure because we can trust the API over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">other pieces of code. And here, what you and what you've probably witnessed, you can't actually trust</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">large language model to return consistent outputs. And, you know, in short is that the technology for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">agents is currently not there. So the good news is that structure generation, which is the ability of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">guiding the model to return to the specific structure. Actually, so we'll see is that it allows you to be GPT for a sort of a byproduct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The goals for today are first to introduce the open source library outlines for those of you who don't know about it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">then very briefly explain how it works. I won't get into the technical details and then try to convince you that you should use it today</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">for, you know, most of the workflows that you have to deal with and sort of a very short glimpse into the near future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So outlines a Python library emphasis on library. You can actually include outlines in your workflow and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not like frameworks where you have to make your workflow, you know, fit inside a framework. I think as a result,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it's been adopted by VLLM and TGI in the serving frameworks. And if you use function calling in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">either of these libraries, you're actually using outlines under the hood. Outlines under the hood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm co-author, but outlines would be nothing without its contributors. Today, it's 87. I think it might be 88.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I merged a PR this morning. I don't remember. And so outlines would be nothing without all these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">people. And I thank them, thank them a lot. Um, people thought we're crazy about a year ago when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we're talking about structured generation. Uh, but since then, uh, pretty happy because it looks like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">people are sort of caught up with the topic and realize that you can actually, you know, you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">actually, uh, do a structured output. Um, so just now, just to run through, quick run through outline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so usually generating text happens in three stages. Uh, the first stage is that you need to choose the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">model and instantiate it. So outlines is purely focused on open source models. Uh, we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=203" target="_blank">00:03:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">integration with six different model providers, uh, transformers, Lama CPP, and also, uh, recently we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">added MLX, uh, MLX. Um, we have an integration with open AI, but that's mostly for us to compare</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the results that we get with open models with the results that are given by open AI. The second step</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is to, I mean, generate texts. What you do is that you instantiate a generator using generate.txt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Here we just want to, you know, return a single sentence. So we're telling the generator stop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">whenever you encounter a period. And the question is described, then you call the generator, uh, with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">your prompt. And here is describe the benefits of structured generation in one sentence. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll have to wait for 10 more minutes, uh, hopefully less. Okay. Now we get into structured generation. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">without outlines, without outlines, if you ask what is the IP address of the public Google DNS servers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and you just generate text, you just let the LLM do its thing, then generally it will yap for a long</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">time. Uh, you know, a hundred tokens, 500 tokens, and the answer will be somewhere in there. And the way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you extract the answer is using regular expressions generally. Here, what you can do with outlines is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">actually taking that regular expression that you use, you would use to extract the answer and use it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">guide the model, to tell the model, this is the structure that the output should follow. And as you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">see, you kind of remove the yapping. You print the, you just call generator rejects, call the generator. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">what you get is just a result. And it's actually the correct answer. Uh, that was with Mistral, uh, 7bv01.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Regular expressions are not the only way to define structure. Uh, something that people need a lot in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">practice is like JSON. And outlines allow you to generate, um, to generate text that, you know, is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">JSON object with a given structure. The way you specify the structure is using JSON schema, or you can pass by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">identity models as well. Um, now you might notice on the flight information. So here we're, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">it's the example that I use at the beginning, you're extracting flight information from an email.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=329" target="_blank">00:05:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I could have used string as a type for origin and destination, but I did not. I use actually a custom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">type that we implemented in outlines. And the reason is that origin and destination have way more structure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">than just text. It's actually, you know, it's, it's an airport code that has three letters that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">capitalized and you can actually specify more and more structure, all the structure that you have in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">your problem. Basically, uh, you can use this with vision models. Uh, that's something that we merged</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">recently. So here we took, um, I think it was a picture from Wikipedia, uh, of a dish. Uh, we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.520</a></span> | <span class="t">tell the model what is the JSON that we expect as a, as a, as an, as an output. And then we instantiate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the generator and then pass the image on the prompt of the generator and we get valid JSON. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">if you want to install outlines, uh, and you think you could benefit from structure generation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">then it's very simple. Just install outlines. Now I'm going to try to very quickly explain how it works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so models themselves, uh, what Mr. All and Korea this one are doing, uh, is actually training model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.880</a></span> | <span class="t">weights. Uh, what a model does is, uh, you input a prompt, you send a prompt. It's like token IDs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And what you get as an output is not text. It's larger. It's a probability distribution over the next token.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, what happens after that, when you want to generate text, the first step is that you have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">logic processor that biases the logics.

And now I'm going to convince you, uh, that there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">absolutely no reason to not use, sorry for the double negation here, to not use structure generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, the first reason is that most text is structured. Um, I talked to you about JSON earlier. We talked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">about regular expressions, but here, I just took the GSM 8k dataset. Um, if you look at a, if you're not me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and don't show everywhere, um, what is it immediately, if you look at the right, uh, you can actually see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that it's highly structured. It's always Q, uh, period text until a question mark, then et cetera, so on and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">so forth, arithmetic operation, which is defined by a context-free grammar.

So there's a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">structured text out there, not just, uh, thank you. I'll, I'll be, I'll be quick. Um, of course the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">second benefit is that, uh, you get valid structure. I mean, that's an obvious thing. That's what we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">doing it.

Uh, it's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">crazy stuff to get valid JSON as an output and it's not even guaranteed. And here without lines, you just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=536" target="_blank">00:08:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">sample what you want. It's just simple as this. And as an experiment, it's actually an experiment</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that pretty based it, uh, they took Mistral 7BV01.

When you had structure generation on top of it, you get 99.9% and that's without optimizing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the prompt.

So you actually have, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't have to fear for that affecting inference time, uh, which is the highly, you know, highly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">non-trivial thing. Uh, here we compared, uh, the overhead introduced by guidance when they do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">structure generation, uh, you know, as a function of the number of generated token and at the bottom,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it's outlines, uh, outline says approximately zero until the end. Uh, as a trade-off, there's a compilation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">time. But during inference, it doesn't slow down inference. Now we're at a point where we could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">integrate this in Brock and you wouldn't see the difference between structured and unstructured.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so no overhead, but even more than no overhead, it is faster to generate text with structure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">generation. Um, the first is that when you take JSON, you don't need to generate the tokens that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">correspond to the bracket and to the field names. I know that in advance, I don't need to ask the model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to return, uh, to return, uh, the tokens. So here on this very simple example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=621" target="_blank">00:10:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">only five out of 10 tokens need to be generated. So only one half, but there's an even more subtle,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">um, way in which it accelerates inference. And this is the example that we took at the beginning. So here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I asked ChatGPT like a good model, like ChatGPT, the same question. What is the, uh, public, like the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=642" target="_blank">00:10:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of Google's public DNS servers and ChatGPT took 50 tokens, you know, it yapped it, yapped it, yapped it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and give it up to 50 tokens. It's not as bad. It could get a lot worse, uh, with lesser models. Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">but when you use structure generation, you just generate eight tokens. So that's a subtle win,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=660" target="_blank">00:11:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">which it accelerates inference by your law. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">then it improves efficiency and that's probably the most, uh, actually mind-blowing result, uh, that we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">had. So here, what you're looking at is the accuracy on GSM 8K, uh, with again, Mistral 7BB01,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">structured and structured. And here we look at the accuracy as a function of the number of shots. So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">number of examples that you give to the model, uh, before asking the question. And what we found is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">that, yeah, foreign structure, normal one shot is worse than eight shots. Uh, that's completely expected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, but what we find with structured is that you actually, and that's really surprised us is that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">actually get in the same ballpark in terms of accuracy with one shot as you do with eight shots,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">which is surprising for machine learning. Something like you would think that examples are there to teach</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the model about the task, but it looks like it's actually there to teach the model about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=714" target="_blank">00:11:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">structure of the problem. The more investigations to do in this line, but that was very mind-blowing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And the last one, which probably, you know, after faster, a lot of people care about here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is that it does improve the performance of open source models. Uh, here, um, what you're looking at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=734" target="_blank">00:12:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is the Berkeley function calling leaderboard, uh, simple function benchmark. And we'll look at the accuracy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing we did is that we took Microsoft pre-medium model, uh, which is a small model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, but we looked at its accuracy without structure generation. It's 86%, which is pretty good for an open</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">model. Uh, 5.3 is actually a pretty good model. When you add structure generation, you get 96.5%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And as a comparison, GPT-4, the best version of GPT-4 on this task, 93.5%, uh, on this benchmark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And now there are two things to note is that 96.5% gets dangerously useful. And the second thing is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=778" target="_blank">00:12:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we have open models that are available today that can be, you know, larger models, um, without fine tuning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's pretty huge room for, uh, open models. And that's why I'm really bullish on open models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, you know, as a community, we can actually extract a lot more out of these models. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and this is just a glimpse. Um, the work that I just showed you is what we did at .txt about a year ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Since then we've generalized from regular expression to, uh, you call context-free grammars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Context-free grammars are used to define code. They used to define protein structure. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and to define as well, what I showed you earlier on the gsm-8k example. So we can do the same thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">structure generation with no overhead with, um, with context-free grammar. We also started working</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">on, um, semantics, like adding some semantic constraints to the generation. And one very popular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">example of this is the SQL, uh, text-to-SQL most model that SQL syntax. Usually what they get wrong</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is the hallucinate table or column names. And a internally, we're able to get perfect text-to-SQL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can guarantee you that the query will be correct and give you the answer that you expect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">but I can guarantee you that it will run.

Oh yeah. And we also starting to, uh, to bubble up computations into the structure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">generation, into the model architecture, because when you think about it, we're biasing logits.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNmfvN6S_n4&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">When you're biasing logits, the model is actually doing computation for nothing.
