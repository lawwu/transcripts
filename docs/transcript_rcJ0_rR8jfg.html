Is it consistent that certain groupings of lounge types are better than others? I think on average, the airport run ones tend to be a little bit worse.</p><p>They tend to be pretty basic. They tend to be just a little room sometimes. Even domestically, there are some airports that run their own lounges and they're nothing special. But if you think about it, it makes sense because airports tend to just take whatever extra space they have and say, hey, how do I generate revenue from this?</p><p>And in those cases, you as a traveler are not the customer. The airlines that might pay a little bit for their premium passengers to use that lounge, they're the customer. It's usually airports that aren't big enough where airlines will want to operate their own lounges. Obviously, if an airport is trying to lease out space, the best way is to lease it out to an airline or even to a restaurant, things like that.</p><p>But if it's not big enough to support that, they'll just run their own really basic lounge, offer some soft drinks, and that's about it.</p></div></div></body></html>
