They've agreed to pay $418 million in a settlement last week, people are freaking out about it. As you know, the seller of a home pays the buyer's agents Commission buyers are responsible for paying their agents commissions going forward. It's always been crazy to me that anyone would pay a percent of absolute value.</p><p>It makes no sense. I bought a home for a million. I'm selling it for a million one. So I've made $100,000 profit, but I got to pay $60,000 of my total gross to an agent to sell it for 60% of the profit, I just gave him 60% of my profit on my home, right?</p><p>It makes no sense. And the crazy thing is that a bad sale of your home would be let's call it 900,000 or a million and a great sale would be 1.2. So exactly. There's a very small margin where they actually have an impact based on the quality of their effort, but they get compensated for the whole thing.</p></div></div></body></html>
