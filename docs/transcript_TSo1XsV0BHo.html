Probably was like a four-hour flight, I want to say. But made it to the hotel, gonna chill tonight, gonna chill tonight and get to it tomorrow. Day one out here in Brooklyn. So we're gonna hit the white room, hit the court tomorrow morning, and finally see the facilities.</p><p>I've heard some good things about the whole practice facility and everything, so I'm excited to see it. We're just gonna take it easy tonight, might get some dinner in the city, but man, just gonna try to adjust over the next couple weeks. So we'll see how it goes. The best part of what we got, parking lot over here.</p><p>City. I'm just glad y'all got two courts, man. That's what Connor was telling me. Cause over there we had, we had the one court. Y'all always keep the windows up? As much as we can. When we start practice, sometimes the light from the sun is like too much. But this is, this is what everybody wants to see.</p><p>Smooth though. You know, it's sweet. It's definitely, so that's all Manhattan right there, right? Yeah, so Manhattan is right there, Brooklyn is over here, and then Jersey is on the other side. All them builders is Jersey? Yeah. And that's Manhattan and that's Brooklyn? Yeah. Good job. Jersey is sweet.</p><p>What are they renovating? So there's a lot of stuff going on. I don't know what's happening over there, but I know in the players' suite, they got the, they're redoing our hot tubs, cold tubs, that whole space back there. This is smooth. I'm about to be in here. Yeah.</p><p>All the time. Yeah. This is our flag. Jordy talks about it all the time. Really different when you're ready to connect yourself. It's the beginning of the year, everybody's signing. So, it's always with us on the road. It's always with us at home. It's always with us at Barclays.</p><p>That's brilliant. Oh my God. What you up? What's up? Yeah. Spend a lot of time in here before you get there. Obviously, you'll be looking for holiday, but it's another part of what we've got here. So, on this side, there are more offices that lead to the hydro room that's in the back room.</p><p>Okay. So, back there is where all the pools and stuff are going to place. Five 30 clips. Video room style. And then, just the locker room. Showers, bathrooms over here. You're trying to walk around. Lock the room right here. You got you in the middle. Man, that means something.</p><p>No, it don't. That means something. Nah, that's cool. That's where we at. This is nice. Pretty spacious. Yeah. So, y'all never practice at Barclays? On game day. That's the only time we're really over there. Go and do a little shoot around? Yeah, we'll do a shoot around and walk.</p><p>Last year, we did a shoot around and walk through. It was there. And then, we just stayed there. Smooth, man. Yeah. Yeah. You got the steam room right here. Little sauna type thing. Showers. These are our temporary cold tubs. Because in here, we're all the practice of hot tubs.</p><p>Cold tubs, hot tubs. This is like, I didn't know how to describe it. It's like a little soft bath. You lay in the water and it keeps a little bit sour. Some of them. Yeah, yeah. Whatever that shoot is called. It's that. Is there people being here? Yeah. People going here?</p><p>All the time. That's the float tank. Yeah, exactly that. Exactly that. So, that's pretty dope. We made it, man. Friggin' stay in Brooklyn. How does it feel to be here? Excited. Got my first lift today. My first little court workout. You know what I mean? So, came here to grind.</p><p>Gotta get better. Okay. We were doing the game, my egg lunch. We were doing over here. And then, back here is where we got all of our food. So, we got chefs every day. They cook us breakfast and lunch. It's great. The fridges are stocked. Whatever we need. And then, this is it.</p><p>We're recovering. Get our fuel. That's it. So, yeah, it's us, man. Yeah, it's strange, bro. It's us in a nutshell. Cool, man. Appreciate the little tour. Most definitely. Man, we made it, man. First day in Brooklyn. I'm excited to get to it. About to get this work on the weight room.</p><p>Then, take it to the court. Good little views from the locker room. You know what I'm saying? So, let's do it. Starting off the day, man. Gotta get some good nutrition in me. Normally, I like to work out before I eat. But, who knows what these dudes gonna have me doing today.</p><p>So, I'm gonna eat first. Got a little omelet. Some orange juice. Some oatmeal. A little hash brown. And a bagel. You know what I'm saying? Bagel with cream cheese. I'm not even gonna lie. It's a whirlwind getting traded. Getting traded after figuring out, you know, the new facility. Your new space.</p><p>How you get to the arena. All that little stuff, like, it takes a minute. It took me about three years to learn how to get from my crib to the Denver airport with no GPS. So, it's definitely gonna be a little adjustment period. They got a float tank. They got a...</p><p>That float tank. That's something we didn't have in Denver. You basically just go and you float in the water. And there's so much salt in the water that you just get to float. And chill in there. So, I'm definitely gonna utilize that. Do some... Some prayer in there. Some meditation.</p><p>Stuff like that. I didn't eat too much 'cause I still wanna be light. Feel good for my workout. So, that's what we're going right now. We're going to get this lift in, man. Let's get it. We're going to get this lift. We're going to get this lift. We're going to get this lift.</p><p>We're going to get this lift.

We're going to get this lift. We're going to get this lift. Open the door to the outdoor area. Amazing view of the city. The interior is nice and white. I like the white walls with the wood. Bedroom right here that opens out to the outdoor space.</p><p>Beautiful view when you wake up. A nice little closet area. Good closet area. Good bathroom man. Big tub. Use that as an ice plunge. Cold plunge. I like how light and spacious it is. Back here you've got three rooms. Three guest rooms. So I'm thinking about making this a closet space with my shoes.</p><p>You know what I'm saying? Put some shoes. Put some drip in there. Some game day fits. Set that up like that. I'm thinking I'm going to put my recovery modalities. You know, massage table. Hydrobaric chamber. All that. Go in this bedroom. And then make this an actual room. And then make this an actual room.</p><p>If y'all ever wonder where I got grape from. This is the original grape man right here. Got a fire rooftop space. Put some furniture over here. Vibe out. A little grill. Some more chairs. I like that I can get some sun. Nice little garden area.

Good food. What you about to be on out here? I'm about to take a little video of y'all. What do you think of New York so far Nicodemus?</p><p>Very excited. Very excited. It's dope. What are you excited about? New beginnings. New beginnings. I love the fact that everybody is very detail oriented. Everybody has a sense of urgency. Everybody gets to it. Everybody is getting straight to it. I love the fact that everybody is very detail oriented.</p><p>Everybody has a sense of urgency. Everybody gets to it. Everybody is getting straight to it. I love the fact that everybody is very detail oriented. Everybody has a sense of urgency. Everybody gets to it. Everybody is getting straight to it. I just mapped it. Statue of Liberty right there.</p><p>Find your groove. Find your rhythm. Find your cadence. The difference right now is that hard to stop. Jump. Jump. Reach out. Halfway right here. Halfway. Five. Eleven. Six. Eight. One. I'm not even going to lie. They got me working probably as hard as I've ever worked, but I'm making progress.</p><p>I'm excited, man. It's an amazing opportunity. The staff over here is great. They're getting me right already. We've been in here probably four hours more. Isn't that right, Greg? Four. Four long hours. Getting it in. Man, but we getting better. So that's all you can ask for. We're out here in Brooklyn, man.</p><p>Walking around. Trying to see what's up with the city. You know what I'm saying? Get the view. We're going to go to dinner in a minute, but decided to walk around and see what's up, man. Look at the view, Greg. Need a fit check, Greg. Fit check? Fit check.</p><p>You know what I'm saying? Got the Jumbo Jumbo Chanel on. Got this and Saint Tropez. You're not finding the Jumbo one like this anywhere. Nowhere else. Got the... Got the, uh... You know what I'm saying? The Louie Kicks on. The Rick Owens pants. Poked out, Jones. Everything else in the Mia's.</p><p>Mia's shirt. Mia's hat. Got the Pepsi Roley on. You know what I'm saying? Had to throw a little bit of ice on. Nothing too crazy tonight for dinner, but... You know what I'm saying? That's it. We out here in New York. First night out here. Just chilling. Just chilling.</p><p>Capped the night off. With a good dinner, man. After a tough day in the lab. We pulled up to Tao. It's a nice little spot. It's my first time at this one. I've been to the LA one. And I've been to the Vegas one. See what the food's talking about.</p><p>Good little ambiance. We just gonna kick it. Get some good food. And get ready for another day in the lab tomorrow. We got a couple appetizers, man. If you know me, you know I love some edamame. Some shishito peppers. Got a little mocktail. This joint right here is fire.</p><p>Waiting on the main course. Man, here goes some of the main courses. We got a little sea bass right here on the skewer. Fire. Got the chicken wings. Some fried rice, man. Some orange chicken. We about to dig in. Good little meal to finish the day. Man, it's been a long but productive day.</p><p>Got that working this morning. Then got to, you know, enjoy the city a little bit. Check out Brooklyn. Check out New York City. Got to tour a couple places. See where I wanna... See where I wanna live while I'm out here. Got some good food in me. And now we back in the room.</p><p>About to get some rest. Probably about to find a little show on Netflix. And get me some sleep. Get ready for tomorrow. So, like I told y'all, I'm gonna be doing this little vlogging thing. I hope you liked it. I hope you enjoy watching. Curious Mike out, man. He's Mike out, man.</p></div></div></body></html>
