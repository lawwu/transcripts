Like, not speakeasy in that it's hidden, but really kind of creative, high-end cocktails. They had an entire train car inside the restaurant. One of them said the ingredient was electricity. I don't know what that means, but it was absolutely delicious.</p><p>But we had a lot of people join us that night. It was like a free afternoon in Reykjavik on the tour. And a bunch of people just all, even though we'd all been hanging out together nonstop, we still were enjoying each other's company so much that we checked out a bar together.</p><p>And then from there, we ended up going to Sumac for dinner, which was phenomenal. Yeah, it might be one of the best restaurants I've eaten at in a long time. And the chef has another restaurant called Ox, which is like a fixed price, multi-course. I think they have exactly 17 seats, pretty high-end expensive experience.</p><p>And then also this other restaurant, which is like Icelandic food and ingredients merged with Middle Eastern flavors and highly recommend.</p></div></div></body></html>
