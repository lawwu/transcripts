I'm actually going to a AP store today, get my first, get my first AP. I got a bunch of rollies, but I ain't got no AP, so I'm about to go cut my first one. It's pretty exciting. Got grape in the cut.</p><p>Man, let me see that backpack, man. Who copped that for you? Limited edition from Mr. Grape himself. Limited edition. I think we got that. Where were we at? Aspen? Aspen. 101. That joint hard. And you got the grapes on there. We at the AP store, man. This is a stepping stone.</p><p>I got all these rollies, no AP. First AP, man, my girl Natalie, the goat. Man, came in. You know what I'm saying? Man, first AP, this is a big deal. This is a big deal. This is a big day for me. Been one of these since I got in the league.</p><p>Now I'm capping. I just got into watches a year ago. But I'm excited to get my first AP, for sure. Man, I don't got too much to say. Speak for itself. It's been a good day, y'all. Just walking around NYC for the first time. I think we're in Midtown.</p><p>I think that's what they said. Doing a little shopping. Got a good cop today. You want a picture? If you say your name for my vlog. What's your name? Melissa. Melissa, yes. You can get a picture. What's up? Got the personal shopper with us. Hey, Andrew, can you introduce yourself real quick?</p><p>What's up, man? My name is Jeff. Okay. I work at Saks. I got MPJ. First time in Brooklyn. We're going to show you how Brooklyn gets down. Yes, sir, man. And those are some drippy white boys right there. Got Grape on the left. Nick on the right. Hey, Grape.</p><p>What'd you cop today, boy? A little bit of Louie. A little bit of Balenci. Yes, sir. Hey, Nick. What'd you cop today, fam? Got a little Louie crossbody. Louie kicks. Louie shirt. Balenci shirt. Just something slight. Man, I see a homeless dude over there. I've seen him eating out the trash.</p><p>If I got cash on me, I'm always going to try to help out a brother like that. You don't want no cash, sir? Okay, I guess not. I guess not. It's really sad. It's sad because, like, we've seen him reaching in the trash can and getting the peanut butter and jelly.</p><p>That's tough, bro. I feel bad for him. It's sad, for real. Fight for that, man. I'm a creative director, dog. There you go. Go ahead. Yeah. Because you got to see. I got to check out your brand, dude. Yeah. I had to pull up to this spot for brunch.</p><p>Mason Clothes right here in Soho. It's a nice truffle pasta. What's crazy is I grew up vegetarian, so I didn't even eat steak. I probably started eating steak like a year or two ago. So I'm going to taste it, pause, and see what it's talking about. Oh, okay. Cipriani right over there.</p><p>My dude, thank you. Appreciate it. Yes, sir. Thank you. That's fun, dude. Pulled up to Bottega. Trying on a few different bags, not purses. Man, I want to get the people's opinion on this. We in here shopping for some little bags, but do y'all think these are purses? Or do y'all think these are some swag?</p><p>Let me see what you got on right now. Just a little Louis crossbody right here. Yeah, a little Louis crossbody. We ain't here in Bottega looking for some little bags. What y'all think about this, man? This is just right here. There's like two of these in the world, man.</p><p>Let me know what y'all think. People, where y'all be at? Come support y'all. What's the cause, bruh? I'm going to save money and stay out of trouble. Are y'all capped or y'all for real? For real. Man, you lying. I'm going to go. All right, Yvette, what y'all be charging for them joints?</p><p>Anything you want to kill. But $20 is my lucky number or $100 is my dream. I want some roll-ups, some fruit snacks. What's that, some drip? Yeah, I got drip. What's it called? Basically, my brand is some bracer roots. That's the theme of my brand. Celebration of roots? Yeah, eight-wing bracer roots.</p><p>Let me see them joints. Yeah, these are the shirts. Come on. Damn. Oh, my God. We about to get a chop right now for my boy EZ Tel Aviv Cut. Say what up. You know what I'm saying? We're here bringing my boy to life. Yes, sir. It was a little before video.</p><p>He about to get me right, so. Stay tuned. How long have you been cutting for, bro? I've been cutting over 10 years. I've been really taking it serious, probably. What year did Tay don't come in? Around 18, 18, 18, 2018, 17, 18. The thing is, with cutting hair, with all the different hair textures, you can never be precise.</p><p>Yeah, my hair is different. I got different calyx. Yeah. So, some barbers, they don't get me right. What's your podcast about? Honestly, bro, I just interviewed, I interviewed different people, you know. A lot of athletes, when they have podcasts, they only interview athletes. Right. And for me, like, I'm trying to touch every lane of life, so.</p><p>Get a perspective of. Get perspectives of things I'm interested in. So, like, it's called Curious Mike. And basically, whatever I'm curious about, I'm curious about a lot more than just. Than just ball. Than just basketball. So, I'm interviewing, like, bro, I had, like, an ex-FBI agent on there who worked all the undercover cases that he couldn't talk about.</p><p>I had a porn star on there to talk about how she got into that. I had a girl on there who got, um, who had got trafficked one time. And it was a human trafficking survivor. Oh, I get it. I'm trying to, I've had, like, pastors on there talking about different things.</p><p>I'm just trying to touch every lane of life and things that I'm interested in, so. Yeah, because, you know, it's a rare thing for an athlete to do. You know, a lot of people don't see athletes interview anyone outside of that. Of what they're doing. Exactly. Exactly. And honestly, what happened was, I felt like on Twitter or, like, Instagram or as an athlete, like, if you, people, things get taken out of context.</p><p>So, what happened to me was a couple things came out that kind of got taken out of context. I tweet, I used to be on Twitter, like, if you tweet something, people can perceive it any way they want. And so, I came up with the idea of having a podcast to where, like, if people really want to see what you're about and what you're talking about, go watch the full form of the podcast.</p><p>Don't tell me. Even though they still take little clips and they, they, they edit it out, you know. But still, like, if you, if you take the time to go watch the full thing, it's there for you to watch. You know what I mean? You don't be the person to tell my truth.</p><p>Yeah, I got it. Right out of what the media does. I definitely got misunderstood a couple times and that made me feel like, man, I'm off this Twitter thing. I'm off the Instagram thing. I want the long format, being able to talk about certain things. And, like, open conversation, too.</p><p>Because I feel like, nowadays, everything is scripted. Not only that, but if you have an opinion that differs from what society says is the right way of thinking about things, you're kind of canceled. Man, so I wanted to open up a lane for, like, people to have an open, honest conversation.</p><p>And it's coming from a place of, like, humility and curiosity and not just, like, right, I know it all. You feel me? Exactly. Let's see how I'm put together, man. Shout out to my dude. Say again, Easy Tel Aviv. Easy Tel Aviv Cuts. You know what I'm saying? Easy Tel Aviv Cuts, man.</p><p>Got me right. Got any last message for the people watching, man? Anything you want to say? I just want to say whatever it is that you're good at and you're doing it, stay consistent. Someone will notice you. You've been a long way, you know, cutting. You feel me? Now he cut everybody.</p><p>Everybody in the business. How's it going? No warm-up. If I make... Hold on. We got to get this. We got to get this for my grand. You got to get the facility. They be talking trash. If I make over 7 out of 10 threes, y'all all owe me $100 and I'm going to leave the cash up in the buy-off.</p><p>If I make less than 7 out of 10, that mean I owe, like, 10 of y'all $100. Now you do 100 push-ups. How do you push-ups? How do you push-ups? On the camera? On the camera. All right. I got to make... I got to make 7 out of 10.</p><p>7 out of 10. 2-1.

So we're about to go crazy with the Puma drip today. Going to take care of my guy Sean behind the camera. Going to take care of my guy Nick over here. And we're about to go crazy.</p><p>Let me put my camera away so I can really get busy. I got immunity and lack the continuity. I leave him in the dust and stack bread cause I'm moving things. Speed reached a new high when I started removing things. I had to drop the baggage out the plane before I flew a wing.</p><p>I think they're fresh. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles collection. I think they're fire. Different. What you got? I know like what made them collab with Squid Game. Puma got the most creative collabs. Oh. You know Donnie Namias. Shout out Donnie man. It's all I rock. But he just did a collab with Puma.</p><p>That's fire. Yeah. Yeah. He got the kicks with the Namias collab fire. There goes some of the mellows right there. Is it? I ain't gonna lie. These look crazy. I just don't know if it's a little weird if I rock his kicks cause that's Lil bro. Shawn the man behind the camera.</p><p>Shawn the man behind the camera. You like all the basic? All the basic joints? Simple guy man. Some little white shorts man. You in here going crazy. Look at this big suede shoe right here. And it's like actual real suede. It's like a real shoe. Cause nobody gone tell it like it is.</p><p>So I be showing them the way. Living by example put my life on display. What's up y'all. Just got done at the Puma flagship store out here in Midtown. You know I got the weekend off so we had to do a little shopping. Definitely had to stop by Puma.</p><p>Like I said I've been with Puma for 7-8 years now. So had to pull up. As you can see we went crazy. My guys got right. I got right. So we good. Yes sir. We out here at the Yankees game right now. It's my second baseball game I've ever been to.</p><p>I went to one Rockies game back in Denver. But I had to come check out the Yankees. You know I've been rocking the Yankees ever since I was a JIT. So it's good to come check them boys out. They balling right now. You know what I mean. We in the GM suite.</p><p>I guess he's not here today. So they put us up here in the suite. Got a perfect view. We're out here kicking it. Oh then he gotta go crazy. Bases loaded. The dude at the bat is the dude who plugged us with the tickets. Let's do it Jazz. Hey Nick you've been coming real drippy lately.</p><p>Can we get a little fit check please. Got me a little Louie Bay jeans. Louie ski board and shoes. Got my Louie crossbody. Valenciaga cut off. Little rolly action. Just something slight. Just a calm little day. Hey can we please get a fit check sir. Bro. Free free free free.</p><p>This popcorn is elite. Two balls two strikes. I think it hit somebody in the head boo. Two outs, two strikes, three balls. It's a big play right here. Yeah so. 2-2. They don't have plays and stuff. So they don't have to like show up super early. Do pre-game all that stuff do they?</p><p>I feel like they just. They gotta practice hitting. Practice fielding. Like they still do like their warm ups and stuff like that. But they don't have. They actually are kind of. They play every day bro. I feel like. I'm telling the culture. We're playing every day. Like I'm just pulling up to the game.</p><p>We're on the main concourse with it now. I think they got a Benihana in here. So that's what I'm looking for. Oh yeah this is what I was looking for. Right here. That Benihana. Michael Porter Jr. What's up my guy? What's up? Yeah. Let's do it. You like baseball or basketball more?</p><p>Basketball. Big Knicks guy. Let's go Knicks baby. All right. Yeah you can take a flip. Wait Knicks? I'm the shotgun. Oh. Help us make Brooklyn great man. Yeah let's do it. Let's do it. Thank you so much man. We would be playing against the Knicks and you would have to wear a Nets shirt.</p><p>What's the best part of New York? The city. The city. The city. Probably the pizza in the city. The pizza? The dollar pizza right? Yeah. What about the Nets? Okay. The Nets. The Brooklyn Nets. I'm the Knicks fan. I'm the Knicks fan bro. Y'all tripping bro. Y'all wild. Yeah let's take a picture real quick bro.</p><p>Thank you so much. Alright y'all have a good one. The stadium's pretty dope bro. Honestly. For the most part people are chill. You know what I mean? The stadium's fire. This is some real New York. It's iconic. The stadium's iconic. So I'm enjoying it. You tall bro. You don't hoop.</p><p>Yeah I do. I'm going to college. I'm going to college. Yeah good luck next season. It's Gordon. I said it was pretty chill. And then it got hectic. Yeah sure. I'm 6'10". You're 5'1". I don't know how bro. When I guess someone's height. It's the right height every single time.</p><p>Weird to me. Is that that Sprite lemonade? Yeah. Oh good look bro. That's sad. Three fourths lemonade. Thank me later. Even at a baseball game. Discipline must remain out. So you don't do no T meals. No T meals. I don't know how bro. I don't know how bro. When I guess someone's height.</p><p>It's the right height every single time. Weird to me. Is that that Sprite lemonade? Yeah. Oh good look bro. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it.</p><p>I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. You feel me? Even at a baseball game. Discipline must remain out. So you don't do no T meals.</p><p>Chicken, shrimp, avocado rolls, no sauce. Fit it with some of the ginger. Well. Who said well? Can't say the same man. I got this chicken and fried rice bowl with the yum yum sauce. Why are you so healthy then? Man. You're not trying to get pudgy? At all. Man, where are y'all ranking the sporting events in terms of enjoyment and going to the games?</p><p>Where do y'all rank baseball? For me, I think that basketball is definitely the most fun. I think hockey might be second. Then I'm going baseball, then football, then soccer. I think baseball is dope because you just get to chill at the game. You know, vibe. Eat good food. Bring your friends to relax.</p><p>But it is kind of slow. But it's been fun though. It's been a vibe. The dudes outside the arena is trying to finesse us. Talking about 275 for a 30 minute drive. So we had to rock with my boy right here. He's getting us for the 200. He's getting us for the low because this other dude tried to finesse.</p><p>I'm out here. I'm out here one week and people are always trying to finesse me. The kids on the street charging $100 a shirt. Shout out to them though. Shout out to my guys. Super dope. You know, the fans showed love. The game was fire. It was cool, man.</p><p>New York is definitely growing on me. After I've been moving around a little bit, seeing different sites, doing different things. So far it's been love. I'm happy to be here. And I'll definitely be going to more Yankees games because we came to the suite. They had the food laid out and everything.</p><p>They had it all set up for us. It was dope, man. It was dope, man.</p></div></div></body></html>
