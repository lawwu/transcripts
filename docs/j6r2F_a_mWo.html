And there are several that I think are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.600</a></span> | <span class="t">worth visiting. The Musée de Montmartre, which is in the 18th. So if you're going to go up toward</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the Sacré-Cœur Cathedral or Basilica in that neighborhood, so the 18th arrondissement,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that's a fantastic, small, really intimate museum. And I believe they have a nice in inner garden.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You also have the Gustave Moreau Museum. And similarly, it's so beautiful. It's quite small,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">really inexpensive entry fee and is focused on it was the former home of the of the artist Gustave</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Moreau. And so all of it is sort of not recreated, but sort of frozen in time as though it's how he</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">left it. And his works are displayed. And there's this really iconic spiral staircase. It's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">beautiful. And that's a much smaller, less overwhelming experience. And then for something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">bigger, but still, still completely worth visiting is the Carnavalet Museum, which is in the Marais.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's the city of Paris museum, essentially. And so you have all of the works, all of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">exhibits are related to the history of Paris. And that is just sort of a non-negotiable for me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">but it often doesn't make the list for people when they when they come and they're doing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, the Louvre, the Musée d'Orsay and some of the other big classics. And then finally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=451" target="_blank">00:07:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I would say if you're really into contemporary art, you could go the gallery route, which is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit more intimidating, and I think a little bit less sort of easy to navigate. Or you could go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to the Pinot collection, which is again, one of, you know, one of France's billionaires who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">has a private institution, but it's in a really spectacular building quite in the center of city,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">not not far from the river.

I think you also sort of have to plan ahead because I know that if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">go too late in the afternoon, you may hit a point where they're not actually letting anyone in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">anymore. And so you just sort of waited in line. It's very cool, though. I mean, I think that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">something you're not going to get in a whole lot of cities, other cities. And then beyond that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there's some sort of unusual tours you can you can get on that are sort of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">taking you through a specific history. So it might be like, you know, a Paris under the occupation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or something like a women, the women of Paris tour. So there are things that are sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">not necessarily super unusual, but just not your general overview kind of experiences that that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">are, you know, that are worth looking into.

Is there a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, I don't know, a blog that talks about things?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I, for one, think the problem is that, you know, people don't spend a lot on those. And so you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of get what you pay for. I think that there are a couple of things you can do if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">interested in, you know, wine tastings or certain specialists, for example, certain spaces. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the Cave du Louvre, there's Cave Woman Wines, and she runs different events in her in her</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">wine shop. I think there, you know, you sort of have to be specific when you're looking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're looking for a service that has multiple types of tours or experiences,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's good to look at, for example, Context Travel, which is a company that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">runs experiences and tours in a variety of different cities in the world and have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">very good docents and very good themes.

In Paris specifically, you also have Paris by Mouth, which are obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=685" target="_blank">00:11:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">as the name suggests, food, food focused tours. And then there are a bunch of independent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">smaller run kind of experiences in food. I mean, food is really the area where we're, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">bursting at the seams with options. But I would say, you know, either you get recommendations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">from, let's say, like a travel planner who has connections with certain key guides, or, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I, for one, do a couple of tours upon request that are based on my book, but I don't do this full</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6r2F_a_mWo&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">time.
