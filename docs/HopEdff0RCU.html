And I think that's a really good point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=176">00:02:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's our highest rated pod ever was discussing the GameStop issue. So you had these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=182">00:03:02.220</a></span> | <span class="t">traders from Wall Street Bets, these Redditors who, like you said, they perceive themselves as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=187">00:03:07.140</a></span> | <span class="t">the heirs to occupy Wall Street. They're trading for profit, also for revenge. And then you guys,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=195">00:03:15.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I guess, get a call in the middle of the night from the clearing house and you have to freeze</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=199">00:03:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">the buy side of the trade the next day. I guess let's fast forward to that because that was the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=204">00:03:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that, you know, got everybody up and running. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=206">00:03:26.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, you guys are a very open arms. Could you, I guess, talk to us about kind of what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=209">00:03:29.880</a></span> | <span class="t">happened? And I'm sure you didn't want to have to freeze trading, right? But you were being compelled</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=216">00:03:36.300</a></span> | <span class="t">by this clearing house. Can you kind of explain what they told you and why you had to do it? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=223">00:03:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">why not just ask them to give you the order in writing so you can post it on your website so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=228">00:03:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">everybody would know you didn't have a choice?

By the time we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=244">00:04:04.440</a></span> | <span class="t">restricted these securities to PCO and it was 13 securities that we limited to sell only,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=251">00:04:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that process is actually operationalized within Robinhood. So we do it from time to time under</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=259">00:04:19.400</a></span> | <span class="t">various circumstances like corporate actions. So when something has a reverse stock split or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=265">00:04:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">something like that, we can do it from time to time. And then we can do it from time to time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=266">00:04:26.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we can do it from time to time. And then we can do it from time to time. And then we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=266">00:04:26.580</a></span> | <span class="t">PCO it for a little bit. So there's a button in a dashboard that you can click and automated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=272">00:04:32.260</a></span> | <span class="t">emails get sent out. So it's an operational process that I think in hindsight, we probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=278">00:04:38.820</a></span> | <span class="t">should have exceptionalized to make it clearer why we were doing this, just given all the swirl</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=285">00:04:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">around all these meme stocks online. But as soon as those emails went out, the conspiracy theories</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=293">00:04:53.220</a></span> | <span class="t">immediately started coming out. And so we had to do a lot of work to get the data out. And then we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=296">00:04:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">had to do a lot of work to get the data out.

How could you be on the side</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=300">00:05:00.980</a></span> | <span class="t">of the hedge funds? And of course, we're not on the side of the hedge funds. I mean, we're,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=305">00:05:05.420</a></span> | <span class="t">we're building products for our customers. And we just had to do what we did to meet our deposit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=311">00:05:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">requirements. Because if we didn't do that, we would be in violation. And the consequences of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=317">00:05:17.340</a></span> | <span class="t">that could have been much, much worse than simply halting buying in the 13 stocks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=322">00:05:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's where, you know, when you were on CNBC with Sorkin,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=326">00:05:26.380</a></span> | <span class="t">people either thought you were obfuscating or you were lying. You know, and part of it is sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=333">00:05:33.220</a></span> | <span class="t">the guts of your business is that at some point as well, you guys decided to self clear, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=339">00:05:39.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And then going into self clearing, you become liable for every single trade that happens on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=343">00:05:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">your platform. Like, if you look back on those two weeks, what self clearing means, it means that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=351">00:05:51.380</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, typically, you can work with a wholesaler to offload the risk. So Vlad acts as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=356">00:05:56.100</a></span> | <span class="t">transaction. And then you have to go back and look at the other side of the coin. And then you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=356">00:05:56.360</a></span> | <span class="t">have to go back and look at the other side of the coin.

At some point, these guys for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=361">00:06:01.140</a></span> | <span class="t">economic reasons decided to take that responsibility on themselves. But when you do that, you take on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=366">00:06:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the full fledged liability of the value of every single trade on behalf of your customers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=371">00:06:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I would think about it, I would explain it as there's like pre trade,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=376">00:06:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">right, then the trade and then post trade. So Robinhood obviously does pre trade with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=382">00:06:22.460</a></span> | <span class="t">that's the app and what's called the introducing broker dealer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=386">00:06:26.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so we do the trade. So we route it to, you know, all the firms like Citadel Execution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=391">00:06:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Services to Sigma, and then Robinhood securities does the post trade the clearance and settlement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=397">00:06:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So we manage the exchange of cash and stocks that happens on t plus two, so two days after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=404">00:06:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">after the trade is made.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=405">00:06:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So what was not I mean, if you had to give that answer again, when Sorkin said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=411">00:06:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you have a liquidity issue?

It wasn't?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=419">00:06:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So I stand by what I said, and I'll explain it. And thank you, by the way, for giving me a chance</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=424">00:07:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">to explain it. First of all, restricting securities, restricting the buying of securities</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=431">00:07:11.740</a></span> | <span class="t">is something that every pretty much every broker did to some degree during this week, right. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=438">00:07:18.680</a></span> | <span class="t">when you say the L word and financial services, it reminds you of Lehman Brothers, where you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=446">00:07:26.300</a></span> | <span class="t">operate your business, we met all of our deposit requirements, the new capital that we raised the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=451">00:07:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">3.4 billion wasn't to meet our our ongoing deposit requirements, we had met them. And in order to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=458">00:07:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">relax them and eventually unrestrict them, we needed to raise some more capital and eventually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=463">00:07:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">have more cushion so that if we keep seeing the type of growth that we kept seeing, we didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=469">00:07:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">have to impose position limits again. So I stand by what I said, I think if you describe that as you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=476">00:07:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">said, the L word, every pretty much every broker would have had that issue. And I think at that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=481">00:08:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">point, the word kind of loses its meaning and the the gotcha factor that the journalists are trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=486">00:08:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to get out of it. Do you think that the risk in the business went up when you decided to self clear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=492">00:08:12.900</a></span> | <span class="t">or would this risk have been the same if you work through a wholesaler?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=495">00:08:15.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I think a lot of the a lot of the other brokers who relied on clearing firms had the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=502">00:08:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">issue, right? You know, there's there's firms like Apex,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=506">00:08:26.260</a></span> | <span class="t">clearing, which has introducing brokers, cash app, for example, clears through a third party as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=513">00:08:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And they all had this issue. And of course, their response was, they kind of threw their clearing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=520">00:08:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">firm under the bus, right? So obviously, we're not going to do that, because our clearing firm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=525">00:08:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is Robinhood Securities. But I think understanding the space a little bit better, since Robinhood</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=532">00:08:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Securities is, you know, a subsidiary of my company. And I think that's a big part of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=536">00:08:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">business. And I think that's a big part of the business. And I think that's a big part of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=536">00:08:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I realized these clearing firms had to do what what they did, like, there's no, it's non negotiable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=543">00:09:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to meet your deposit requirements. Of course, we can ask, what can we do? Are these deposit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=549">00:09:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">requirements sensical? What can we do to drive change in the system? And I think that's my,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=554">00:09:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">what's that? Who sets those requirements? That's the clearinghouse, right? Is that the DTCC?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=560">00:09:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's the DTCC. And a lot of this stuff is actually spelled out in Dodd Frank. So if you look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=566">00:09:26.220</a></span> | <span class="t">at Dodd Frank, you'll see descriptions of the VAR charge and the various special charges there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=571">00:09:31.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But I do think one thing that I'm very excited about is, you know, not going beyond just talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=579">00:09:39.860</a></span> | <span class="t">about our problems, right? We can, I've talked about our problems a lot, but talking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=584">00:09:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">solutions and how we can create a better financial system in the future. And I really think if you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=589">00:09:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">if you understand the underbelly of what T plus two settlement is, you immediately ask yourself,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=596">00:09:56.200</a></span> | <span class="t">aren't we settling trades in real time? And I wrote a post on that. I had a tweet storm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=601">00:10:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd also say, you know, some of the feedback that I've gotten is, you know, here's Vlad from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=606">00:10:06.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Robinhood telling us about, you know, trying to change T plus two so that he can meet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=610">00:10:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">he can lower his deposit requirements. I think there's lots of other systemic issues that fall</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=615">00:10:15.380</a></span> | <span class="t">out of that. In particular, right now you can short sell more stock than the shares that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=621">00:10:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">outstanding, right? So, you know, some of these stocks had 140% short interest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=626">00:10:26.180</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So more, more shares were shorted than actually outstanding. And I just think that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=632">00:10:32.120</a></span> | <span class="t">pathological. And it stems from the fact that, you know, these shares are tracked on pieces of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=637">00:10:37.540</a></span> | <span class="t">paper. So they're basically not tracked and someone can, you can, I can lend you my shares.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=644">00:10:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You can short them. The person that's buying them from you can lend them again. And you can do that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=649">00:10:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">multiple times and you end up with this situation that could destabilize the financial markets,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=654">00:10:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">right? So.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=656">00:10:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">What, okay. So T plus, moving from T plus two to T plus zero, that's one issue. Where do you think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=663">00:11:03.300</a></span> | <span class="t">margin?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=664">00:11:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's what I was going to ask. Where is your margin?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=667">00:11:07.100</a></span> | <span class="t">What's your thoughts on margin?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=668">00:11:08.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=669">00:11:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, so margin wasn't involved in this particular situation. In fact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=675">00:11:15.420</a></span> | <span class="t">there was an escalation path. Not a lot of people noticed until Thursday, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=680">00:11:20.100</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty much all the brokers, including Robinhood were ratcheting up the margin requirements</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=686">00:11:26.140</a></span> | <span class="t">for all of these securities until they got to a hundred percent. So by the beginning of the week,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=692">00:11:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">they were pretty much all at a hundred percent, which means you can't use margin to buy them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=696">00:11:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to, you have to have them a hundred percent covered. So do you guys have a more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=702">00:11:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">specific question on margin? Well, I meant more like, I meant more like, so for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=706">00:11:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's true, but you tell me if this is not true. You guys paid like a $65 million fine to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=716">00:11:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Robinhood, right? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=717">00:11:57.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not, not exactly true, but go ahead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=720">00:12:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Do you want to, do you want to just tell us what the truth is?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=724">00:12:04.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Well, so the, the fine wasn't for gamifying Robinhood. It was for payment for order flow and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=733">00:12:13.100</a></span> | <span class="t">business model related, related things. The gamification one is the Massachusetts securities,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=741">00:12:21.420</a></span> | <span class="t">securities one, which is a separate thing. And look on the SEC thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=746">00:12:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">we're a fast growing company. We obviously scaled a lot between the period in question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=752">00:12:32.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously the, the securities and exchange commission felt like we could have done things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=761">00:12:41.140</a></span> | <span class="t">better. And, and I own that. I think that we're fine being held to higher standards. We have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=766">00:12:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">hold ourselves to higher standards. And what we can do is just do some of the things we've done,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=772">00:12:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">staff up our compliance team, staff up our legal team. We brought on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=776">00:12:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a new chief legal officer who is a former SEC commissioner, two new chief compliance officers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=781">00:13:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">for Robinhood securities and financial who had decades of experience and the level to which we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=787">00:13:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">investing in compliance. I mean, the goal is to build the finest legal and compliance team that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=792">00:13:12.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the financial industry has seen. Let me tie it back flat to what, to what we were talking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=797">00:13:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">before. So do you think that it's okay if we're trying to build a generation of investors to give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=805">00:13:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">them access to margin as easily as some apps, including Robinhood does, and then separately</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=812">00:13:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">allows them to trade highly transactional high vol instruments like options on top of that with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=820">00:13:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">margin? What do you think about that? Just as a general philosophy, forget business building for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=824">00:13:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">a second. Well, and then also, can you say what the margin you allow is for a new account? Because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=829">00:13:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think people understand what that is. Maybe a little definition there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=831">00:13:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, there's a couple of things I want to clear up. Number one, you can't trade off</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=835">00:13:55.260</a></span> | <span class="t">options on margin. So options are all fully paid for, right? Margin is not suitable for everyone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=842">00:14:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll admit that you have to understand it. And you also have to be a Robinhood Gold customer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=848">00:14:08.520</a></span> | <span class="t">which means you have to sign up and pay $5 a month. Most brokers don't gate margin behind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=854">00:14:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a premium offering. So we're already a little bit more restrictive on that front. You have to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=860">00:14:20.680</a></span> | <span class="t">$2,000 in your account before you can borrow. And you have to have a little bit more money in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=865">00:14:25.240</a></span> | <span class="t">account. And in December, we did lower our margin rates to 2.5%, which is a very competitive low</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=871">00:14:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">rate. But let me tell you a use case for margin that I actually think is quite powerful. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=876">00:14:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously, one use case is kind of the typical one of buying more stock with your money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=882">00:14:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you build a large portfolio, you can actually use margin as a line of credit. And we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=888">00:14:48.740</a></span> | <span class="t">offer this feature with our debit card. You can turn on what's called margin spending.

So I actually think it's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=907">00:15:07.560</a></span> | <span class="t">powerful tool.

And ultimately, the majority of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1040">00:17:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">them end up losing most of their money because the fees and the spread and the margin or whatever it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1044">00:17:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is that they're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1045">00:17:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that kind of adds up, you know, wipes out the account. That's what I saw this forex company I was involved in. Can you share with us, you know, in a very candid way, like how many accounts do eventually go bankrupt at Robinhood? And how much of that do you really see?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1057">00:17:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, I'd say forex is a little bit different, because the leverage you get in forex is like orders of magnitude.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1063">00:17:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I'll admit to that it was like 10 to 50 to one leverage. So you're totally right. Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1068">00:17:48.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So I do think the businesses are a little bit different. Most of our customers don't use leverage. Most of our customers aren't active traders or trading options. And if you look at some of the features that we've rolled out, the theme of this year has been how do you turn a first time investor into a long term investor. So fractional shares, recurring investments, drip. These tools allow someone to create a diversified portfolio of individual stocks and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1098">00:18:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">recurringly buy into them over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1100">00:18:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So is that the majority of users today or the minority? You know, how many accounts do you see kind of cycle down to zero over what period of time?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1110">00:18:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I think a very small percentage of accounts have that have that property. I mean, I think if you look back in 2020, we had a huge increase in growth and interest in investing right at the bottom of the market crash in March. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1128">00:18:48.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think people have taken advantage of that. And our customers in general have benefited from the recovery very, very significantly. So I wouldn't I would reject the the meme that, you know, Robin Hood customers are active traders that are just, you know, churning their accounts and losing all their money. That's, that's just simply not what we're seeing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1150">00:19:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I know Saks has a question. But one question I had with the conspiracy there is that I would just love to hear like a yes, no to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1158">00:19:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1158">00:19:18.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Did Citadel call you and say stop this madness because they had exposure through one of their hedge funds with GameStop?

Sequoia didn't call and ask?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1181">00:19:41.420</a></span> | <span class="t">No.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1182">00:19:42.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Did the SEC call you and say this has to stop?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1184">00:19:44.780</a></span> | <span class="t">No.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1185">00:19:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But the clearinghouse did, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1188">00:19:48.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, well, they called and they said, here are the deposit requirements. And we worked with them to lower the risk so that we could meet the deposit requirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1196">00:19:56.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Got it. And so just let me pick up on that. So at the same time that was happening. And I know this wasn't Robin Hood, this is not your company. But, but Discord and Reddit were receiving reports that the Wall Street Bets forum was engaged in hate speech, and there was an organized effort to get them censored and taken down. And Discord basically fell for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1218">00:20:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And took down Wall Street Bets. Reddit, to their credit, did not. Do you have a take on, you know, what happened there? And, I mean, I assume you don't think Wall Street Bets was engaged in hate speech?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1230">00:20:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, so that happened Wednesday, I believe. And yeah, we were watching it. It was first, it was like, oh, wow, Discord, Discord shut down. And then I think Wall Street Bets went dark on Reddit for a little bit as well. But I'm not quite sure of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1247">00:20:47.980</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's just the reasoning behind that. Look, I mean, I disavow hate speech, misinformation. I'm not, you know, judging which of the posts are hate speech or not. I think that's the social media companies that should take a look at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1264">00:21:04.780</a></span> | <span class="t">The mods, I think the mods closed down Reddit for like a little bit and then turned it back on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1269">00:21:09.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1270">00:21:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, a lot of these things get triggered if 10 people reported at the same time. It just, it sets off a circuit breaker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1277">00:21:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it seems to me that, and certainly this is, if you want to call it a conspiracy theory, it seemed like you had this Wall Street Bets group. They were on one side of the trade. You had these Wall Street hedge funds that are on the other side of the trade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1288">00:21:28.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And there was an effort to weaponize the speech rules of Reddit and Discord to cut off the lines of communication of Wall Street Bets. Because the only way that Wall Street Bets, as a decentralized group of millions of traders, can stick together and compete with these hedge funds is if they can communicate with each other by these services.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1307">00:21:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And so,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1307">00:21:47.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think that's the social media companies that should take a look at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1337">00:22:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think that's the social media companies that should take a look at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1367">00:22:47.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think that's the social media companies that should take a look at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1397">00:23:17.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think that's the social media companies that should take a look at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1427">00:23:47.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think that's the social media companies that should take a look at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1457">00:24:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think that's the social media companies that should take a look at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1487">00:24:47.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think that's the social media companies that should take a look at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1517">00:25:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think that's the social media companies that should take a look at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1547">00:25:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think that's the social media companies that should take a look at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1577">00:26:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think that's the social media companies that should take a look at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1607">00:26:47.740</a></span> | <span class="t">the third thing I'd put is just, maybe you guys have seen, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1611">00:26:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">know, I feel like I've evolved as the chief executive, and as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1615">00:26:55.960</a></span> | <span class="t">leader, I didn't used to be on social media telling our story</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU&t=1619">00:26:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">very much.
