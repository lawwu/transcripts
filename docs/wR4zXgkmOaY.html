I'll explain the trap</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and why it doesn't work and then talk briefly about what works better.

I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.480</a></span> | <span class="t">feel like I have control over my life, but I want to do something interesting with it.

I want to do something interested with it. When people get this impulse, which I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is a fantastic impulse, they realize they're not quite sure how to do it and they fall back on a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">common mistake, which I call the grand goal strategy. So the grand goal strategy says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">if you want to make your life more purposeful, come up with a really appealing grand goal to pursue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">with the idea that if you accomplish that goal, your life will be better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So it really focuses your attention. There's a few different variations of the grand goal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">strategy that are common in terms of what it aims at. One has to do with the radical change</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in your life circumstance. So this variation of the grand goal strategy is let's move to the woods.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's move to the island in the South Pacific. Let's rebuild my life around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">triathlon running.

Move to the big city is a common one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Move to the country is another common one. So it's often about setting, but not always. It can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">also be about just something about the circumstance of how you live your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's another example of this. It's not setting related.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Financially speaking, we have the FIRE movement, the Financial Independence Retire Early movement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=180" target="_blank">00:03:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that picked up in the 2010s. And it had this idea that if you're very aggressive about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">saving money and living cheaper, you can reach financial independence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">after about 10 years. So maybe in your thirties, you don't have to work anymore. You can live</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">cheaply and live off of the returns of investments. That's another example of a grand goal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that's going to change everything. I don't have to work anymore. So a radical lifestyle change,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=208" target="_blank">00:03:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">common category. Another common category that the grand goal strategy applies to is the dream job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, if I could follow my passion to the job I'm meant to do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">if I could just get the job as the television writer or the standup comedian or the college</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">professor, or whatever it is, but here's my passion. Here's my dream job. If I could just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">make my job, my dream job, then my life would be better. Common application of the grand goal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">strategy. Another is just achievement focus. This is very familiar to the sort of Ivy League milieu</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in which I sort of came up in. I'm actually going to my 20-year anniversary, not anniversary,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">what do they call it? Reunion? - You're going?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">- 20-year college reunion at Dartmouth College in a couple of weeks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">- We have ours too.

Yeah. I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">go to mine. But anyways, that crowd, there is this sort of pre-professionalism often of like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">if you can just reach a certain level of achievement, that will fix everything, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So now you have like a focusing grand goal to go after. It's if you can get into the good law school</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and from the good law school, get into the big firm and in the big firm, get partner and from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">partner, get equity partner, boom, life will be good. That's what, if you could just get there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">life will be good. You get in the medical school and you get the good residency and then you get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the good attending position, then you get the good, it's this idea of like the achievement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Or if I can, in banking, make it up to this level, the MD level where I'm really pulling it in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that's where it's going to happen. Or in academia, if I could just get to like be a full professor,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that's it. That's when the happiness will come, right? So there's this sort of achievement version</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of the grand goal strategy, where you focus on reaching a particular achievement. And finally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and this is the one that comes and goes, I think most dramatically throughout the last 150 years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">or so, is this idea of, okay, if I can just fully commit to a singular ideology that can structure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">my existence and understanding of value in the world, then that's going to do it. Like a cause</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">based ideology that I can just give myself over to, maybe that is going to give me a life that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=347" target="_blank">00:05:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">feels like it's intentional. So that's the grand goal approach. It's what most people do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's do something big. It makes sense, by the way, because A, you get reward right away with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the grand goal approach because there is the rewards of aspiration, the thinking about this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going after this. What's it going to be like when I move to the country or don't have to work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.840</a></span> | <span class="t">anymore? Or I am allotted for my commitment to the cause or get that equity partner status, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">We get enjoyment almost right away just thinking about the big change. Two, focus is simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Focus is nice.

And let's start getting systematic about it. It's a perfect time to start.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1479" target="_blank">00:24:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm excited for you Ahmed.

What were you like in your twenties?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1490" target="_blank">00:24:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Were you locked in or were you Ahmeding it? I was a little of both. I went to grad school,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1498" target="_blank">00:24:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">then I was figuring out where I wanted to live. And then I settled on DC,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1502" target="_blank">00:25:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">started coaching, kind of like, you know, piecing together stuff that I wanted to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1507" target="_blank">00:25:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">for a long term. So that's how I ended up in DC. Grad school stretches out that period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1511" target="_blank">00:25:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Like a lot of people, I was in grad school in my twenties too.

So like if you're doing graduate education, you're kind of just extending your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1520" target="_blank">00:25:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">college experience. Like you're thinking about your studies and it's really not until you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">done with education often that you're like, okay, now what am I trying to do here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I knew I wanted to move somewhere where I could establish my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Man, our twenties. Well, I was in grad school, but like the situation at MIT was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1538" target="_blank">00:25:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you are here.

You're like, this is what you're here for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1548" target="_blank">00:25:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the lofty goal. If you fall short of this goal. Not great. So we were very focused,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1556" target="_blank">00:25:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, on like developing this very narrow set of skills,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1559" target="_blank">00:25:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">which was a lot of people would drop out.

Yeah. Masters. Yeah. There's a lot of that or they'll,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">they'll get it, but then go to, you know, industry, which, which again, people get wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">People think about, oh, the best thing to do would be to go to like Google and get a lot of money,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1580" target="_blank">00:26:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">but not in that environment. Like Google hires hundreds of people every year. You're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1585" target="_blank">00:26:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">have to program if you go there. No, no, no. Tenure track professorship. Like that was,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1589" target="_blank">00:26:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that was the vision. So I had an unusually locked in twenties. All right. What do we got next?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1595" target="_blank">00:26:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Next question is from Joe. I've consumed most of your content, which includes reading some of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">comments on your YouTube videos. I see a bunch of comments of people talking about how to create deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1606" target="_blank">00:26:46.720</a></span> | <span class="t">life while at work. For example, a truck driver commented that it's difficult to do anything,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1611" target="_blank">00:26:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but listen to music while driving as everything else is a distraction. Is this related?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1615" target="_blank">00:26:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an interesting question, Joe. I think this probably is coming down to a definition</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1621" target="_blank">00:27:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">issue. So you're seem to be relating or conflating the deep life with, I guess, like the structured</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1632" target="_blank">00:27:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">consumption of information, the sort of exposure to books and big ideas and not spend as much time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1637" target="_blank">00:27:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">with just narrow distractions, which could be a part of it. But let's, let's expand our terminology</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1642" target="_blank">00:27:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">here so we can deal with this issue better. Right. The deep life is a life that's intentional,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1647" target="_blank">00:27:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">lived on purpose, the type that sort of seems remarkable to you and people around you. There's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1652" target="_blank">00:27:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of aspects of the deep life, including your work and what in the deep life you, you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1658" target="_blank">00:27:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you have all the different things you're doing. You hopefully are moving towards your ideal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1664" target="_blank">00:27:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">lifestyle vision as opposed to moving away or being sort of unrelated to it. Work can play a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1671" target="_blank">00:27:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of different roles in that. Right. So, you know, there's jobs, for example, that yes, are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1676" target="_blank">00:27:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">very attention demanding. So maybe truck driving is like that. If you need to be focused on what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1681" target="_blank">00:28:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">you're doing, clearly, if you're like an emergency room doctor is going to be like that, like I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1685" target="_blank">00:28:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">focused on what I'm doing for the work and that's fine. Right. That could be very much a part of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1689" target="_blank">00:28:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">your ideal lifestyle vision.

There's the broader program here is that I got this sense from my listeners and from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1826" target="_blank">00:30:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">my readers that this is a very important question. The pandemic really put this question to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1831" target="_blank">00:30:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">forefront of a lot of people.

They were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1834" target="_blank">00:30:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">just sort of bouncing around. Like, what am I doing here? I want to be in control of like what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1838" target="_blank">00:30:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">my life is like.

Right. So it became clear during the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1847" target="_blank">00:30:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">pandemic that lots of people were grappling with this issue.

Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1854" target="_blank">00:30:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not a philosopher.

Like, so what is my approach here? Well, my, my, my approach to this topic is we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1865" target="_blank">00:31:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">focus a lot on the what, but what sort of things does a life well live have in it? We don't focus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1873" target="_blank">00:31:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">enough on the how, the mechanics, the nuts and bolts of actually engineering or re-engineering</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1880" target="_blank">00:31:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">what your day-to-day existence is like. We sort of take that for granted and focus on like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1883" target="_blank">00:31:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">here's what you need in it. And it's important that you have, you know, whatever, like community</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1888" target="_blank">00:31:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">or that you have this or that we list these different attributes where we get inspired by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1892" target="_blank">00:31:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">these stories of my God, like, look at David Goggins is grinding after it. But we don't often</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1898" target="_blank">00:31:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">get into the nuts and bolts mechanics of like, okay, but how do I get from here to something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1901" target="_blank">00:31:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that's different?

And so everything I do about this topic is sort of centered on like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1911" target="_blank">00:31:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">let's get into the nuts and bolts. That's why I play with very specific analogies to try to put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1915" target="_blank">00:31:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">structure around the, the, the behaviors and the strategies and the frameworks you need to actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1920" target="_blank">00:32:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">get to make change. So those stacks were something I was experimenting with. There's other things I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1926" target="_blank">00:32:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">experimented with as well. Um, where I am now is I'm sort of working on an annotated outline for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1932" target="_blank">00:32:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">book on this sort of focus on the, how, instead of the, what, when it comes to engineering a more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1937" target="_blank">00:32:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">intentional life, I've sort of simplified it more.

It's like, these are the things that kind of matter for doing this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1970" target="_blank">00:32:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, I start with, and again, this is, I'm working on this, so don't, don't, don't lock this in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=1976" target="_blank">00:32:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">either, but starting with preparation.

Um, implementation is like, so how do you actually do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2029" target="_blank">00:33:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this? How do you make progress towards a lifestyle vision? It's not trivial. You got to deal with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2036" target="_blank">00:33:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">rituals. You got to deal with projects, one-time projects that you pursue. You have to deal with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2040" target="_blank">00:34:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">changes.

How do you do rituals,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2047" target="_blank">00:34:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">projects, and changes? How do you navigate those properly? Well, you know, you can't just take wild</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2052" target="_blank">00:34:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">swings at it. You have to do evidence-based planning. You have to sort of, um, slowly build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2057" target="_blank">00:34:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">up to things there. There's a creativity to this to try to find, well, if I do this, it can affect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2063" target="_blank">00:34:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">three different parts of my vision in a positive way. There's a real art to the actual mechanical,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2068" target="_blank">00:34:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like here's what I'm now doing to make progress towards the vision. It's not so simple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2072" target="_blank">00:34:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So we got to get into that thinking about rituals, projects, and changes and the, the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2077" target="_blank">00:34:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the subtle art of pursuing those.

This is this idea that we talked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2083" target="_blank">00:34:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">about again, during the deep dive that once you're systematically moving towards your lifestyle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2087" target="_blank">00:34:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">vision, opportunities for the remarkable will arise and they will not be things you could have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2093" target="_blank">00:34:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">predicted in advance, and they will be bespoke to your current situation and the current things you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2098" target="_blank">00:34:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">care about. This is where things get interesting. How do you seek out those opportunities? How do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2102" target="_blank">00:35:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you vet them? How do you pull the trigger on them? Right? This is where the really cool stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2107" target="_blank">00:35:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">happens, but it happens kind of late in the progress. And then finally growth. This is this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2113" target="_blank">00:35:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">idea that you're, you need to keep maturing your vision of the ideal, what your ideal lifestyle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2119" target="_blank">00:35:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is. This will mature over time, but you need to fuel this maturing process. Uh, you getting older</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2125" target="_blank">00:35:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">will help, but you also have to systematically try to just mature your understanding of the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2130" target="_blank">00:35:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Like when we talk about building a vision of the ideal lifestyle, I talk a lot about seeing what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2137" target="_blank">00:35:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">resonates with you. Well, you can mature over time, even your mechanisms for resonance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2141" target="_blank">00:35:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">like the sophistication with what, uh, with what you detect things that appeal to you or not,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2146" target="_blank">00:35:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">or what's important or not. And we get philosophy here and we get theology here. Um, we get, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2151" target="_blank">00:35:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">know, hard one wisdom here. So there's this whole sort of process of growth over time. It's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2155" target="_blank">00:35:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of becoming a, um, a more mature person, a more value-driven person. You get better at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2162" target="_blank">00:36:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So you don't have to be there full form when you start this process. So that's,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2166" target="_blank">00:36:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that's how I think about it. Now we can put this, we could call this a stack, but I don't bother</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2169" target="_blank">00:36:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">with that anymore. So again, the summarize, you prepare that you build your vision,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2173" target="_blank">00:36:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">then you implement with care. You look for opportunities to amplify and you grow over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=2177" target="_blank">00:36:17.280</a></span> | <span class="t">time.

So him and his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4749" target="_blank">01:19:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">editor for his nonfiction book wrote the relic, which is like this fantastic thriller about a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4757" target="_blank">01:19:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of monster loose in the American museum of natural history. And they became a writing duo</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4762" target="_blank">01:19:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and started writing all of these thrillers together, just Lincoln child thrillers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4766" target="_blank">01:19:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And then both Lincoln and Douglas write their own books at the same time. And anyways, I think he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4769" target="_blank">01:19:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a cool guy. He lived a cool life. Extinction was kind of a cool book. It was interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4773" target="_blank">01:19:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Then I read when the shooting stops dot, dot, dot the cutting begins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4781" target="_blank">01:19:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So I am a, as you know, a sucker for these books about specific people in the movie industry where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4789" target="_blank">01:19:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">they talk about their career and all the movies they worked on. This is yet another book written</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4794" target="_blank">01:19:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">by an editor. This is the second book I think I've read this year about a film editor. And this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4801" target="_blank">01:20:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Ralph Rosenblum had a real distinguished career, did some really famous stuff with Cindy Lumet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4807" target="_blank">01:20:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and then did a bunch of Woody Allen stuff, including Annie hall. And so this is really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4812" target="_blank">01:20:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting. He's a older generation. I mean, you know, he was really working in like the sixties,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4817" target="_blank">01:20:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">he was working in the seventies. And again, it's cool to learn about the art of editing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4821" target="_blank">01:20:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It's interesting to hear these stories, his story on Annie hall in particular is really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4827" target="_blank">01:20:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting because that movie was filmed to be something completely different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4830" target="_blank">01:20:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">The original name of Annie hall was a hedonia and it was all of these different,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4836" target="_blank">01:20:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">it was supposed to be sort of inside the mind of the Woody Allen character and just showing all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4842" target="_blank">01:20:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">these different aspects of his life and all the different stuff going through his mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4845" target="_blank">01:20:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was supposed to be like this sort of psychological realism. The Annie hall relationship</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4851" target="_blank">01:20:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">was like one of multiple plot lines that was going to, this movie was weaving together to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4857" target="_blank">01:20:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">show the complex psychological life of this, this main character. And in the editing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4864" target="_blank">01:21:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">they rebuilt it to be about Woody Allen's relationship with Diane Keaton. And at one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4868" target="_blank">01:21:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">best picture. So that was probably the coolest story in the book to hear about that. So if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4872" target="_blank">01:21:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">love the sort of, if you're a movie cinephile type, this was a great one. All right. Final</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4876" target="_blank">01:21:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">book I read in May, 2024, the great partnership by Jonathan Sachs. I referenced this in a recent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4883" target="_blank">01:21:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">episode. Um, you know, I really liked Jonathan Sachs writing. This is about the values of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4890" target="_blank">01:21:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">science and the values of religion. And it, it takes a sort of historical theological look at it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4896" target="_blank">01:21:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's this big distinction between what he calls the values of Athens and the values</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4901" target="_blank">01:21:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">of Jerusalem. It's like two completely different ways of like processing the world and thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4906" target="_blank">01:21:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">about things. And he basically makes the argument that they're very complimentary and you need both.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4910" target="_blank">01:21:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. Uh, he thinks this is interesting points in it. Right. Keep in mind, this book was written</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4917" target="_blank">01:21:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in the first decade of the 2000. So this was a, or maybe like 2012, but it was a response to the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4922" target="_blank">01:22:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the new atheist, right? It was a response to Dawkins and Hitchens, et cetera, who, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4927" target="_blank">01:22:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">were, he sets them up as trying to, um, have the mindset of Jerusalem take over the mindset of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4936" target="_blank">01:22:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Athens. Like there was, they're like at odds and the new atheists were saying that the Athens mindset,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4941" target="_blank">01:22:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the sort of left brain scientific mindset, that's what works. And this other thing is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4945" target="_blank">01:22:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">mythological and fiction and doesn't work. And in the book, he's trying to show like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4949" target="_blank">01:22:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">they got that wrong. These are like two separate ways of seeing the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4952" target="_blank">01:22:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But he argues the reason why we mix this up is because starting with Pauline Christianity going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4959" target="_blank">01:22:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">forward, you had these Greek ideals, the sort of Athens left brain way of thinking was increasingly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4965" target="_blank">01:22:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">actually integrated into theological thinking. And for a while, Christianity tried to, to combine</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4970" target="_blank">01:22:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">these two and that didn't work well. And that's what made them seem like they were somehow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4973" target="_blank">01:22:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">intention. Anyways, it's classic sacks where he somehow takes really complicated topics,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4979" target="_blank">01:22:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like the history of Western philosophy, the development of the Abrahamic faiths,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4984" target="_blank">01:23:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and he can just talk clearly and simply about them. Like, Oh, I get it that they're there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4988" target="_blank">01:23:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">These mixed together real skill to do that type of intellectual, uh, intellectual survey</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4994" target="_blank">01:23:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">with narrative momentum in a way that's very accessible to a non-specialist audience. He was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=4999" target="_blank">01:23:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the best at it. So I actually learned a lot. And again, I use this sort of Athens, Jerusalem</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR4zXgkmOaY&t=5005" target="_blank">01:23:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">analogy in a deep dive a few weeks ago.
