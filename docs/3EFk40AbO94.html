interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4612">01:16:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to me is that you have these

where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4633">01:17:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">now you can see that you know M2 has materially started to shrink and I think that that's a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFk40AbO94&t=4638">01:17:18.480</a></span> | <span
