My name is Ola Mabadeje. I'm a product guy from Cisco. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=21" target="_blank">00:00:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">my presentation is going to be a little more producty than techy, but I think you're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to enjoy it. So, I've been at Cisco working on AI for the last three years, and I work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">in this group called OutShift. So, OutShift is Cisco's incubation group. Our charter is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to help Cisco look at emerging technologies and see how these emerging technologies can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.340</a></span> | <span class="t">help us accelerate the roadmaps of our traditional business units. And so, by training, I'm an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">electrical engineer, doubled into network engineering, enjoyed it, and I've been doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.340</a></span> | <span class="t">that for a while. But over the last three years, focused on AI. Our group also focuses on quantum</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.980</a></span> | <span class="t">technology. So, quantum networking is something that we're focused on. And if you want to learn</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.540</a></span> | <span class="t">more about what we do with OutShift at Cisco, you can learn more about that. So, for today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to dive into this real quick. And like I said, I'm a product guy. So, I usually start with my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">customers' problems, trying to understand what are they trying to solve for, and then from that work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">backwards towards creating a solution for that. So, as part of the process for us, we usually go through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this incubation phase where we ask customers a lot of questions, and then we come up with prototypes. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.700</a></span> | <span class="t">do A testing, B testing, and then we kind of deliver an MVP into a production environment. And once we get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">product market fit, that product graduates into the Cisco's businesses. So, this customer had this issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They said, "When we do change management, we have a lot of challenges with failures in production. How can we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">reduce that? Can we use AI to reduce that problem?" So, we double-clicked on that problem statement, and we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">realized it was a major problem across the industry. I won't go into the details here, but it's a big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.380</a></span> | <span class="t">problem. Now, for us to solve the problem, we wanted to understand, does AI really have a place</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">here, or it's just going to be rule-based automation to solve this problem? And when we looked at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.460</a></span> | <span class="t">workflow, we realized that there are specific spots in the workflow where AI agents can actually help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=139" target="_blank">00:02:19.820</a></span> | <span class="t">address a problem. And so, we kind of highlighted three, four, and five, where we believe that AI agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.780</a></span> | <span class="t">can help increase the value for customers and reduce the pain points that they were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">describing. And so, we sat down together with the teams. We said, "Let's figure out a solution for this."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, this solution consists of three big buckets. The first one is the fact that it has to be natural</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">language interface where network operations teams can actually interact with the system. So, that's the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">first thing. And not just engineers, but also systems. So, for example, in our case, we built this system to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">talk to an ITSM tool such as ServiceNow. So, we actually have agents on the ServiceNow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.360</a></span> | <span class="t">side talking to agents on our side. The second piece of this is the multi-agent system that sits within</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this application. So, we have agents that are tasked at doing specific things. So, an agent that is tasked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">us doing impact assessment, doing testing, doing reasoning around potential failures that could happen in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">network. And then, the third piece of this is where we're going to spend some of the time today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">which is a network knowledge graph. So, we have the concept of a digital twin in this case. So, what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">we're trying to do here is to build a twin of the actual production network. And that twin includes a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge graph plus a set of tools to execute testing. And so, we're going to dive into that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.080</a></span> | <span class="t">in a little bit. But before we go into that, we had this challenge of, okay, we want to build a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">representation of the actual network. How are we going to do this? Because if you know networking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty well, networking is a very complex technology. You have a variety of vendors and a customized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.800</a></span> | <span class="t">environment, variety of devices, firewall switches, routers, and so on. And all of these different devices are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.120</a></span> | <span class="t">spitting out data in different formats. So, the challenge for us is how can we create a representation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of this real-world network using knowledge graphs in a data schema that can be understood by agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, the goal was for us to create this ingestion pipeline that can represent the network in such a way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that agents can take the right actions in a meaningful way and predictive way. And so, for us to kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">proceed with that, we had these three big buckets of things to consider. So, we had to think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.400</a></span> | <span class="t">what are the data sources going to be? So, if you, again, in networking, there are controller systems,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">there are the devices themselves, there are agents in the devices, there are configuration management</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.640</a></span> | <span class="t">systems. All of these things are all collecting data from network or they'll have data about the network.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, when they spit out their data, they're spitting it out in different languages. Yang,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.320</a></span> | <span class="t">JSON, and so on. Another set of considerations to have. And then, in terms of how the data is actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">coming out, it could be coming out in terms of streaming telemetry, it could be configuration</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.280</a></span> | <span class="t">files in JSON, it could be some other form of data. How can we look at all of these three different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">considerations and be able to come up with a set of requirements that allows us to actually build a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">system that addresses the customer's pain point again? And so, the team, from the product side,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we had a set of requirements. We wanted a system that, a knowledge graph that can have multimodal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.960</a></span> | <span class="t">flexibility. That means it can talk key value pairs, you understand JSON files, you understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.360</a></span> | <span class="t">relationships across different entities in the network. Second thing is performance. If an engineer is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=337" target="_blank">00:05:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">querying a knowledge graph, we want to have instant access to the node, information about the node,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.800</a></span> | <span class="t">no matter where the location of that node is, that was important for our customers. The second thing was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">operational flexibility. So, the schema has to be such that we can consolidate into one schema framework.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The fourth piece here is where the RAC piece comes into play. So, we've been hearing a little about GraphRAG</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.920</a></span> | <span class="t">for a little bit today. We wanted this to be a system that has ability to have vector indexing in it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.760</a></span> | <span class="t">so that when you want to do semantic searches, at some point, you can do that as well. And then, in terms of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">just ecosystem stability, we want to make sure that when we put this in a customer's environment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">there's not going to be a lot of heavy lifting that's going to be done by the customer to integrate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">with their systems. And again, it has to support multiple vendors. So, these were the requirements</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.160</a></span> | <span class="t">from the product side. And then, our engineering teams kind of, we started to consider some of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the options on the table. Neo4j, obviously, market leader, and the various other open source tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">At the end of the day, the engineering teams decided to kind of do some analysis around this. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm showing the table on the right-hand side. It's not an exhaustive list of things that they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">considered, but these were the things that they looked at that they wanted to see, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.400</a></span> | <span class="t">what is the right solution to address the requirements coming from products? And we kind of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we kind of all centered around the first two here, Neo4j and ArangoDB. But for historical reasons,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the team decided to go with ArangoDB because we had some use cases that were in the security space.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">That was kind of a recommendation system type of use cases that we wanted to kind of continue using.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, but we are still exploring the use of Neo4j for some of the use cases that are coming up as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.720</a></span> | <span class="t">part of this project. So, we settled on ArangoDB for this, and we eventually came up with a solution</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that looks like this. So, we have this knowledge graph solution. This is an overview of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">On the left-hand side, we have all of the production environment. We have the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">controllers, the Splunk, which is a SIM system, traffic telemetry coming in. All of them are coming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">into this ingestion service, which is doing an ETL, transforming all of this information into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.600</a></span> | <span class="t">one schema. Open config. So, open config schema is a schema that is designed around networking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.640</a></span> | <span class="t">primarily. And it helps us to, because there's a lot of documentation about it on the internet. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">LLMs understand this very well. So, this setup is primarily a database of networking information that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.800</a></span> | <span class="t">has open config schema as a primary way for us to communicate with it. So, natural language communication</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.080</a></span> | <span class="t">through an individual engineer or the agents that are actually interacting with that system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, we built this in the form of layers. So, if you're into networking again, there is a set of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">entities in the network that you want to be able to interact with. And so, we have layered this up in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this way such that if there's a tool call or there's a decision to be made about a test. For example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">let's say you want to do a test about configuration drift as an example. You don't need to go to all of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the layers of the graph. You just go straight down to the raw configuration file and be able to do your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.440</a></span> | <span class="t">comparisons there. If you're trying to do like a test around reachability, for example, then you need a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">couple of layers. Maybe you need raw configuration layers, data plane layers, and control plane layers. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it's structured in a way that when the agents are making their calls to this system, they understand</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">what the request is from the system and they're able to actually go to the right layer to pick up the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">information that they need to execute on it. So, this is kind of a high level view of what the graph</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">system looks like in layers. Now, I'm going to kind of switch gears and go back to the system. Remember I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=557" target="_blank">00:09:17.560</a></span> | <span class="t">describe a system that had agents, a knowledge graph, a digital twin, as well as natural language</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">interface. So, let's talk about the agentic layer. And before I kind of talk about the specific agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in this system, on this application, we are looking at how we are going to build a system that is based on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=575" target="_blank">00:09:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">open standards for all of the internet. And this is one of the challenges we have within Cisco. We are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">looking at a system, a set of a collective, open source collective that includes all of the partners</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">we see down here. So, we have OutShift by Cisco. We have Langchain, Galileo. We have all of these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.120</a></span> | <span class="t">members who are supporters of this collective. And what we are trying to do is to set up a system that allows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">agents from across the world. So, it's a big vision that they can talk to each other without having to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">heavy lifting of reconstructing your agents every time you want to integrate them with another agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it consists of identity, schema framework for defining an agent skills and capabilities,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the directory where you actually store this agent, and then how you actually compose the agent,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">both of the semantic layer and the synthetic layer, and then how do you observe the agents in process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">All of these are part of this collective vision as a group. And if you want to learn more about this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it's on agency.org. And I also have a slide here that kind of talks about there's real code actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.440</a></span> | <span class="t">that you can leverage today. Or if you want to contribute to the code, you can actually go there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a GitHub repo here that you can go to and you can start to contribute or use the data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">There's documentation available as well and there's Apple applications that allows you to actually see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.840</a></span> | <span class="t">how this works in real life. And we know that there's MCP, there's A2A, all of these protocols are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">becoming very popular. We also integrate all of these protocols because the goal again is not to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.200</a></span> | <span class="t">create something that is bespoke. We want to make it open to everyone to be able to create agents and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">be able to make these agents work in production environments. So, back to the specific application</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">we're talking about. Based on this framework, we delivered this set of agents. We built this set of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.160</a></span> | <span class="t">agents as a group. So, we have five agents right now as part of this application. There's an assistant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">agent that's kind of the planner that kind of orchestrates things across the globe, across all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of these agents. And then we have other agents that are all based on React reasoning loops.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">There's one particular agent I want to call out here, the query agent. This query agent is the one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that actually interacts directly with the knowledge graph on a regular basis. We have to fine tune these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">agents because we initially started by doing a -- attempting to use RAG to do some querying of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.680</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge graph. But that was not working out well. So, we decided that for immediate results, we are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">going to fine tune it. And so, we did some fine tuning of this agent with some schema information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">as well as example queries. And so, that helped us to actually reduce two things: the number of tokens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we were born in. Because every time we were -- before that, the AQL queries were going through all of the layers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of the knowledge graph. And in a reasoning loop, it was consuming lots of tokens and taking a lot of time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">for it to result -- to return results. After fine tuning, we saw a drastic reduction in number of tokens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.400</a></span> | <span class="t">consumed, as well as the amount of time it took to actually come back with the results. So, that kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">helped us there. So, I'm going to kind of pause here. I'm talking a lot about -- there's a lot of slide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">where here. I want to show a quick demo of what this actually looks like. So, tying together everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.360</a></span> | <span class="t">from the natural language interface interaction with an ITSM system to how the agents interact to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.520</a></span> | <span class="t">how that collects information from knowledge graph and delivers results to the customer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the scenario we have here is a network engineer wants to make a change to a firewall rule. They have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">do that to accommodate a new server into the network. And so, what they need to do is to, first of all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">start from ITSM. So, the submitter ticket in the service now. Now, our system here, the UI I'm showing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=789" target="_blank">00:13:09.880</a></span> | <span class="t">here right here is the UI of the actual system we've built, the application we've built. We have ingested</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">information about the tickets here in natural language. And so, the agents here are able to actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">start to work on this. So, I'm going to play video here just to make it more relatable. So, the first thing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that is happening here is that these agents -- the first agent is asking that the -- for the information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to be synthesized in a summarized way so that they can understand what to quickly do. The next action</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that has been asked here is for you to create an impact assessment. So, impact assessment here just means</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that I have to understand, will this change have any implications for me beyond the immediate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">target area. And that's going to be summarized. And we are now going to ask the agent that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.040</a></span> | <span class="t">responsible for this particular task to go and attach this information into the ITSM ticket. So, I'm going to say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">attach this information about the impact assessment into the ITSM ticket. So, that's been done. Now, the next step</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is to actually create a test plan. So, test plan is one of the biggest problems that our customers are facing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=857" target="_blank">00:14:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And they run a lot of tests, but they miss out on the right test to run. So, this agent is actually able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to reason through a lot of information about test plans across the internet. And based on the intent that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.440</a></span> | <span class="t">was collected from the ServiceNow ticket, it's going to come up with a list of tests that you have to run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to be able to make sure that this firewall rule change doesn't make a big impact or create problems in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">production environments. So, as you can see here, this agent has gone ahead and actually listed all of the test</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">cases that need to be run and the expected results for each of the tests. So, we're going to ask this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.520</a></span> | <span class="t">agent to attach this information again back to the ITSM ticket because that's where the approval board</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">needs to see this information before they approve the implementation of this change in production</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">environments. So, we can see here that that information has now been attached back by this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.560</a></span> | <span class="t">agent to the ITSM ticket. So, two separate systems, but agents talking to each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=908" target="_blank">00:15:08.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the next step is actually run a test on all of these test cases. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.520</a></span> | <span class="t">in this case, the configuration file that is going to be used to make the change in the firewall is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.400</a></span> | <span class="t">sitting in the GitHub repo. And so, we're going to do a pull request of that config file. I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">take that information. So, this is the GitHub repo where we're going to do a pull request. We're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">take the link for that pull request and paste it in the ticket, an ITSM ticket. And so that when the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">execution agent starts doing his job is actually going to pull from that and use it to run his test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So, at this moment, we are going to start running the test. We're going to ask this agent to go ahead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and actually run the test and execute on this test. And so, I have attached the change. Sorry, I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">have my glasses. I've attached my change candidates to the ticket. Can you go ahead and run the test?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what is going to happen here is if you look on the right-hand side of the screen here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a series of things are happening. The first thing is that this agent called the executor agent goes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.720</a></span> | <span class="t">looks at the test cases, and then it goes into the knowledge graph. And it's going to go ahead and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">actually do a snapshot of the most recent visual or most recent information about the network.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.440</a></span> | <span class="t">It's now going to take the pull request that it pulled from GitHub, the snapshot it just took from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the knowledge graph. It's going to compute it together and then run all of the individual tests</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.480</a></span> | <span class="t">one at a time. So, we can see that it's running the test, one test, test one, test two, test three,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">test four. So, all of this is happening in what we call a digital twin. So, a digital twin, again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is a combination of the knowledge graph instead of tools that you can use to run a test. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">an example of a tool here could be Batfish or could be RouteNet or some other tools that you use for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">engineering purposes. So, once all of these tests are completed, this tool actually is going to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this agent is going to now generate a report about the test results. So, we give you some time to run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">through this. It's still running the tests. But once it concludes all of the tests, it's going to report</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=1024" target="_blank">00:17:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">actually the test results are. So, which results, which tests actually passed, which ones failed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=1030" target="_blank">00:17:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">For the ones that have failed, it's going to make some recommendations of what you can do to go and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">fix the problem. I'm going to skip to the front here to just quickly get this done quickly because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=1040" target="_blank">00:17:20.440</a></span> | <span class="t">of time. So, it's attached the results to the ticket and this is the report that it's spitting out in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">terms of this is the report for the test that were run. So, this execution agent actually created a report</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">about all of the different test cases that were run by the system. So, very quick short demo here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.200</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of detail behind the scenes, but I can ask some questions offline. The couple of things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=1065" target="_blank">00:17:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to leave us with is that, before I go to the end of this, is that evaluation is very critical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">here for us to be able to understand how this delivers value to customers. We're looking at a variety of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">things here. So, the agents themselves, the knowledge graph, slash digital twin, and we're looking at the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">what can we actually measure quantifiably. Now, for the knowledge graph, we're looking at extrinsic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.800</a></span> | <span class="t">intrinsic metrics, particularly not intrinsic ones, because we want to map this back to the customer's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.240</a></span> | <span class="t">use case. So, this is the summary of the, of what we see in terms of evaluation metrics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=1097" target="_blank">00:18:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We are still learning. This is a, this is for now, it's an MVP, but what we are learning so far is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=1105" target="_blank">00:18:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">those two key building blocks, the knowledge graph, and the open framework for building agents is very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.520</a></span> | <span class="t">critical for us to actually build a scalable system for our customers. And so, I'm going to stop. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0dxZ-NDKHo&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.200</a></span> | <span class="t">eight seconds to go. Thank you for listening to me. And then, if you have questions, I'll be out there.</span></div></div></body></html>
