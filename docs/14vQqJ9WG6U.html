What Uber did initially,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.340</a></span> | <span class="t">they were like doing all the typical kind of like distributed message queue systems where you kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of have all these messages going across like message buses, like we use PubSub. Then they realized that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.060</a></span> | <span class="t">basically this whole way of doing things is very annoying because you have to keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">duct taping stuff around like Celery and Redis and whatever. So like, you know what,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">we just make an engine that helps us manage all these kind of steps and state and retries and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.900</a></span> | <span class="t">make it so that, make it so that it's durable. So you can just write the code and basically it will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=76" target="_blank">00:01:16.900</a></span> | <span class="t">execute based on exactly what you tell it to do.

So they just tried to build this system. So basically like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">what is a durable workflow engine?

And it's basically just, you have something that is, um, a code execution that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">persistent to basically the, what the inputs and the outputs that you have are persisted. They can be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">retried. They can be, um, restarted from scratch and you will have the same output like in, in, uh, in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in, in, in, in, in this way, it can, um, handle, um, these kind of status stateful tasks across a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=129" target="_blank">00:02:09.100</a></span> | <span class="t">distributed system where you have multiple nodes operating multiple, uh, replicas of your application,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, live. It doesn't matter if one of these things, one of these replicas goes down, your execution still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">continues with all this context that had baked in.

And it also pro it's also a means to provide distributed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">primitives, um, to your application, right? That you can be easily excited. Oh, wait, can you see my,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">where am I sharing? Is it like, uh, the temporal website?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Like this side? Yeah. Yes. Okay. Let me see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I'll probably have to go again in a second, but yeah. So what is, uh, the durable workflow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">right? We're, we're at this part. And the workflow is, it's just a series of steps that you need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">execute to, um, uh, to basically actually give a goal, whatever goal that is, it's up to you, up to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.120</a></span> | <span class="t">person that coding up the workflow, but it's basically a series of steps. They have to be executed in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">particular sequence. Um, those, that sequence can have conditionals where, you know, if you have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.880</a></span> | <span class="t">condition in the, in the middle that you execute a different type of steps. And then the engine is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.720</a></span> | <span class="t">basically the engine part is just the fact that all these, uh, orchestration scheduling, which tasks go to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which worker, how do you discover these workers? How do you retry? This is all matched by the engine itself,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">instead of the programmer programming the workflow. So as a TLDR is busy, like the temple kind of shifts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">this burden of redundancy and recoverability to the platform itself, to temporal itself,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">instead of you having to code in and as business logic. And as I said before, there's less duct taping</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">between all these solutions, like fast API, salary, Redis, uh, and allows for easier negative space</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">programming. I'll go into this a bit later, but it's basically allows you to start thinking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the, your errors first exit and exit your program or retry your program. Um, as early as possible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">instead of like letting the error BS be a afterthought. Right. So yeah. Cool. So let's get into the one-on-one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm, I'm, I'm sure some people here, I know Simonas has, has seen like a way of, of, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">writing workflows either via salary or hatchet or whatever. It's basically, there's a couple of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">building blocks and the main two building blocks of like temporal are activities and workflows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Activities are just simple, uh, units of, of work that have an input and provide an output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, I won't go too much into the detail of the fact that these activities have to be immute. Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what's the word for it? Not immutable, but basically like when you, for the, for a, a specific input,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">your activity for eternity exact output every single time. So if you have the stuff that has side effects,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like, um, a time-based activity or something like that, you need to use other temporal, um, features to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.560</a></span> | <span class="t">handle that, but we won't get into that today because it's a bit too advanced and there's no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.240</a></span> | <span class="t">point in getting into it right now. But basically activities are just functions. They're units of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.080</a></span> | <span class="t">computation, uh, that live on a worker. And then these activities can be then compiled into a workflow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so for example, here you can, you can have this workflow that just does like, uh, reduce some,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">where you give it a value, a list of integers and provide you an integer response,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.120</a></span> | <span class="t">where for each of these values, it goes ahead and executes the sum activity, um, and then stores</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the result in total. The nice thing about this, as we mentioned before, is that these activities,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">they cannot be executed anywhere, right? So even if you're not, I mean, this is not very parallelizable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">because you have to do, I mean, you can't parallelize it if you want this reduced sum,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">but if you would have parallelizable workflows, for example, if you want to, I don't know, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=372" target="_blank">00:06:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">just run a, uh, uh, double function, right? On every single one of these integers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you can run that in parallel and then temporal instead of it's going to handle how it's maps</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.120</a></span> | <span class="t">those units of work to each of the workers, instead of you having to use a thread pool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you have these kind of redis in the background that has to like kind of coalesce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.720</a></span> | <span class="t">between the different, uh, different workers that you're running, if you were running it traditionally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">without them. Yeah. Uh, as you can see here that every single activity can have a retry policy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.400</a></span> | <span class="t">basically like try this activity three times. And if it, um, if it fails after the third time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you fail the activity. And then in the workflow, you can also handle that failure gracefully or crash</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the whole process. And there's also other stuff that you can do. Like this activity should,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it should, it should, uh, finish within 10 seconds of starting. Uh, that's a way for you to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, implement timeouts, uh, make sure that stuff's not hanging and so on and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.360</a></span> | <span class="t">These activities and workflows are all assigned to a worker. So basically, um, as you can see here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=443" target="_blank">00:07:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we have this kind of worker called whatever. Um, the worker has a couple of workflows and a couple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">of activities assigned to it that allows you to kind of break down your dependencies, break down your,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.520</a></span> | <span class="t">your Docker images that are these workers into more granular pieces. So you don't have to build a huge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">image that has all the activity defined defined on it. Uh, I think in the Saturn project, we have some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.560</a></span> | <span class="t">workers that is very similar, right? We have some workers that can run, um, OCR. We have some workers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=470" target="_blank">00:07:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">that they run like other, other parts, but basically, um, a worker registers workflows and activities to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then temporal knows when it receives on this task queue, um, a, some workflow, it can route this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.240</a></span> | <span class="t">this task to one of these workers here. I could define the worker that would have a divide function and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Sorry. Just a quick question. Um, so the workers, you would set up yourself, you deploy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">those and then you're linking to them here. Yeah. So actually this, this is a worker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So think about this main function here, right? This is actually a worker in this case. It's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=514" target="_blank">00:08:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">executing it that is executing a function directly, right? It just, it doesn't, because I'm just trying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=520" target="_blank">00:08:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to like showcase, um, how this works, but then you could also just like do work. Like you can be had like a worker</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and then worker does start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=531" target="_blank">00:08:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then that worker will just hang on there and then just wait and respond to, you know, tasks that it comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and then it gets from temporal. Yeah. So these are in, so I'm trying to understand. So like if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=545" target="_blank">00:09:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in the example that we have like an API and then we have some workers, but then the API container should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.960</a></span> | <span class="t">trigger those workers, is the worker, we're going to link to the worker from the API code?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Nope. That's been, yeah, that's a nice part of it. Basically temporal sits in the, in the middle and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">handles this. So basically what the API will do, and I'll show you this, there's going to be example</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=572" target="_blank">00:09:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">down in a bit after we look at some other stuff. Uh, what the API does when it, let's say receives like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.440</a></span> | <span class="t">a chat streaming request, right? Like a spark. The API only does like, okay. Uh, it will have obviously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously like the same way it's connected to Redis. You'll have like a temporal client and then we'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=589" target="_blank">00:09:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">just be like, okay, Hey, temporal, I want to start this workflow. I want to run this workflow, go run</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">this workflow for me and then provide me the response. And then basically, um, the API can just await that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">awaitable that it gets back from the, the temporal is decayed, the temporal client. Right. Um, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">temporal manages everything. So it's kind of like a, it's a, it's a thing in the middle that we will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.880</a></span> | <span class="t">implement with queues and other kind of stuff that we're implementing right now. The, the client doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.240</a></span> | <span class="t">need to know about which workers, how they're implemented, which worker and has which workflow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which worker has, which some, which worker has using, which task queue, it just goes and they, okay, just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">give me this result. And then temporal implements that. So on the other side, on the worker side,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the worker doesn't need to know how it's being called. Doesn't need to know who's being called.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It just says, I am this workflow. I said, I'm this worker. I ha I can do these workflows. Hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">temporal route, these kinds of tasks to me. Yeah. Yes. Uh, in terms of task use, are you going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">explain a bit more what is behind the scenes, what it uses for the queues? Can we use metrics for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.520</a></span> | <span class="t">scheming workers? Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, I was going to go into that now and make it to me in a sec.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So, okay. Another question in terms of you have function execute workflow, then you give the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">function and then basically the next is the values and those values, which supposed to get to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">signature of the function, right? Yep. Okay. So you see here like the signature of the function is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">values list ends. This is like a, it's like a, a partial function execution, right? We're passing the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">function as a first class variable, the function itself, and then you pass it the values and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.720</a></span> | <span class="t">um, yeah, temporal goes and applies the values to this function to the values in its context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And, and one more question in terms of those functions or how they called not steps, but, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">activities, activities. Are they, uh, distributed across workers or up like instances, or they are in the same,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like machine when they execute it. So, uh, uh, so basically what activity is on a single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">machine executing a single time? It's a unit of computation that the core, right? So you can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.440</a></span> | <span class="t">distribute an activity where you can distribute a workflow. So let's say like, if I want to execute,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like, I want to double each of these numbers, right? I don't want to do it serially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I could just do like, uh, uh, for value and values, uh, await client execute workflow, uh, my workflow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">double, let's say if I have this and then have the value. And then this runs, this will execute,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">this will create three workflows, no, sorry, five workflows, which will run in parallel. And then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=777" target="_blank">00:12:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Temporal is going to assign those to which worker is, is free to pick it up. All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So as tomorrow said, like, let's just get into a bit of how Temporal works in the background,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">because we talked a lot about these kinds of things. So everything in the blue is basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the infrastructure that we abstract away, the queuing, the database, all these kind of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But the most important parts in this is the database, the worker service, and these,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=810" target="_blank">00:13:30.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the other ones we can kind of ignore for now, the history service and the whatever. Basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the worker service is the part where the workers register with a Temporal cluster. So this is like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">this gray thing here is a cluster. It's called a cluster, but it's actually not like a Kubernetes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">cluster, it's just like a collection of Temporal instances that run somewhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.760</a></span> | <span class="t">These are the things that Temporal handles, right? So we only, when you deploy Temporal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it's all handled by Temporal. And then the workers are the ones that we handle. But yeah, so basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">when we create a worker, it registers with this worker service, it provides heartbeats to that service</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to make sure to tell Temporal it's alive. It gives Temporal like load metrics, so it knows how much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you could, how much need more tasks it can take, if it's overloaded, and so on and so forth. This,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=860" target="_blank">00:14:20.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you don't need to think about at all. It's all mapped by Temporal. All you have to do is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I have this workflow, I'm connected to this Temporal cluster, and these are the things that can run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, but the cluster basically handles all the durable state. And we'll get into that in a bit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.040</a></span> | <span class="t">but basically, every single time it provides an input, and every single time a workflow gets an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">output, that's being logged in Temporal. So that if the workflow needs to be retried, it knows how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to retry that. It also handles dispatching of activities to work and workflows to workers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">as we said before. Basically, it looks at the worker service, like which workers are available,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=896" target="_blank">00:14:56.120</a></span> | <span class="t">which workers can take this task that I'm having on the queue, go and execute it. It handles all the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.960</a></span> | <span class="t">retried policies. Basically, you set up a retried policy, I want to retry this activity three times,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">with a timeout of 30 seconds, and Temporal is going to make sure that that actually executes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">in that way. It handles signals, interrupts, and timers, and queries.

The part that we handle is the workers. It's a much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.960</a></span> | <span class="t">easier part to handle, because almost exclusively where you're going to put in the workers, the activities,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and your workflows are going to be business logic, with very little decoration to tell Temporal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.840</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, this is a Temporal function, so execute it as such.

You handle deploying the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">worker that connects to Temporal.

I think you can also do it in Java. And you can also have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.840</a></span> | <span class="t">polyglot system, where you have a Go worker with a Python worker that collaborate together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=967" target="_blank">00:16:07.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in a single workflow, which is great, because different languages are better used for different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=973" target="_blank">00:16:13.960</a></span> | <span class="t">kinds of tasks.

And because of...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, never mind.

And then, let me try to explain this. Basically, what you would be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1275" target="_blank">00:21:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">do is a bit more advanced in the end, but what you'd be able to do is use the workflow itself as the state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1282" target="_blank">00:21:22.440</a></span> | <span class="t">You wouldn't need to have these kind of back and forth from a database to save state. Like the workflow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1288" target="_blank">00:21:28.600</a></span> | <span class="t">would be the state. And then you could just query the workflow directly. So when you were looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1293" target="_blank">00:21:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">in conversation history, you could just say, hey, what's the conversation history on this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1298" target="_blank">00:21:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">object?

So if someone is engaged in a conversation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1327" target="_blank">00:22:07.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that conversation, the execution and the conversation history in that execution is the conversation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1332" target="_blank">00:22:12.680</a></span> | <span class="t">history. There's no need to, you know, coalesce the current conversation that's been executed with what's in the database.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1342" target="_blank">00:22:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.

Let me just, let me refair my screen and stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1468" target="_blank">00:24:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. So this is a workflow that Tempol done. Give me a second to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1475" target="_blank">00:24:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">share it.

So basically on the left-hand side, what you see is a typical chatbot,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1487" target="_blank">00:24:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">um, a typical chatbot that is running in as temporal workflow. As you can see here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1495" target="_blank">00:24:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we're in this new workflow that's being initiated. I'll go to the, to the actual, you know, in innings of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1500" target="_blank">00:25:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the code in a second, but basically we started this new agent with all the tools, all we provided in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1507" target="_blank">00:25:07.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the beginning. And I think this, let me try and make the result from the bigger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1513" target="_blank">00:25:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So, um, yeah. So for example, for us, well, what that would happen is basically someone starts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1526" target="_blank">00:25:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a new conversation with an agent. We know which agent it has, we know what tools it has. All we have to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1531" target="_blank">00:25:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">is basically say, okay, temporal, um, you write, you basically, you only have to write the logic very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1539" target="_blank">00:25:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">generically of like, Hey, I want this spark to take an input from a user, go, go and look at what tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1549" target="_blank">00:25:49.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you can use and use those tools and provide an answer. Right. And then all the configuration of that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1554" target="_blank">00:25:54.360</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of similar to how it is now, uh, would be provided as a, I guess, a configuration object,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1559" target="_blank">00:25:59.560</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Like here, we have some, some goals that we can do. We have some tools that we can use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah, but these are all provided in initially to the, to the workflow context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and then, yeah, we can do whatever, for example, uh, and, oh, okay. Sorry. You can see that now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1578" target="_blank">00:26:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the workflow is paused, right? It's waiting for us to like, say, to confirm this running of this tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1583" target="_blank">00:26:23.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This, this workflow is waiting for this user prompt forever. It will wait forever and it doesn't use up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1590" target="_blank">00:26:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">any computation. It doesn't use up, uh, anything basically. So these workflows can be paused, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1596" target="_blank">00:26:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">forever or as far as like, as long as you want. So if we, if we hit confirm here, you will see that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">basically now this purple signal has been sent here that the, that the agent has, that the user has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1608" target="_blank">00:26:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">confirmed something so that execution can proceed. Uh, because we've told it to list what agents we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1613" target="_blank">00:26:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">currently having available, it goes ahead and runs that. And then for each of these, um, kind of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1620" target="_blank">00:27:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of activities here, we see exactly what's being run, what input is being given, what result is being</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1627" target="_blank">00:27:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">given. So here's like, you are an AI agent, it helps you blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever. You can also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1632" target="_blank">00:27:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">see the result. You can also see how this is configured, where you have a 30 minute timeout for this thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1637" target="_blank">00:27:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, what task queue it runs on, what activities runs on and so on and so forth. The most important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1643" target="_blank">00:27:23.720</a></span> | <span class="t">part is that you can see the result of each of the, each of these ones. So let me go, just go ahead and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1649" target="_blank">00:27:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">like, um, I don't know, let's see, I want, I want to go on a trip, right? Let's see, I want to do this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1652" target="_blank">00:27:32.840</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of like Australia, New Zealand event flight booking. So I just want to say, uh, three, right? I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1659" target="_blank">00:27:39.400</a></span> | <span class="t">use the agent number three. Again, I gave it a user prompt. It waited for me to give it that prompt,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1666" target="_blank">00:27:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">right? It didn't, that, that thing was just sitting there in state. It didn't consume any resources</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1671" target="_blank">00:27:51.800</a></span> | <span class="t">until I gave it the signal that I want to do something. And now it's, it's waiting for me to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1676" target="_blank">00:27:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">confirm again that I want to do something. We don't, you don't have to use this kind of confirmation tool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1680" target="_blank">00:28:00.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but you can use it and you can't pause and, uh, something forever until someone confirms the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1685" target="_blank">00:28:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, the action you want to take. That's the nice thing I think about the using temporal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1691" target="_blank">00:28:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">for agent, agentic workflows is that you can give the user the ability to, you know, confirm or action</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1696" target="_blank">00:28:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">some things at no compute cost for you.

It's just dormant in state until the user provides a new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1709" target="_blank">00:28:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">signal and then the book that the workflow can continue from where it was stopped previously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1713" target="_blank">00:28:33.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So let's proceed with a change call to blah, blah, blah. Okay. I'll confirm to change the goal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1717" target="_blank">00:28:37.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that we want to, our agent goal to be booking a flight. So let me, what event do you want to go to?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1724" target="_blank">00:28:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll say, I want to go to Melbourne. I want to go to an event in Melbourne. Again, provide a user prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Which month? Okay. Let's say July. At each of these steps, you'll see that it waits for the user</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1741" target="_blank">00:29:01.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to give an answer. It runs with the tool that it needs to run and then waits for the user to confirm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1746" target="_blank">00:29:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it.

So we can do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1751" target="_blank">00:29:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the same thing. We can have these kind of, you know, steps of confirmation. So yeah, I want to run the,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1756" target="_blank">00:29:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to run this find events tool. So now it's running a tool for me. Um, okay. I found some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1762" target="_blank">00:29:22.120</a></span> | <span class="t">events, um, Melbourne International Film Festival, blah, blah, blah.

And then in temporal, you can define in the code what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1789" target="_blank">00:29:49.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to happen when the validation fails.

It's much nicer to handle these kind of failures. So yeah, let's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1812" target="_blank">00:30:12.520</a></span> | <span class="t">like, uh, you know, get at least fights around these times.

And it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1886" target="_blank">00:31:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">will create an invoice for me. And then, you know, give me the Skype link and I can go and I pay it by</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1893" target="_blank">00:31:33.960</a></span> | <span class="t">saying Skype, if I, if I want to do it. The nice thing is like, also I can have the signal to tell me that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1901" target="_blank">00:31:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, like wait for this user to finish their Stripe payments and Stripe has those, you know, web hooks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1907" target="_blank">00:31:47.480</a></span> | <span class="t">They can go back into temporal.

So basically that's it. Do I want to proceed with anything else? No. And then at that point,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1923" target="_blank">00:32:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the agent realized that I'm trying to like do a, and it should be close chat please.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1932" target="_blank">00:32:12.600</a></span> | <span class="t">It should realize that I'm trying to, it has a tool that basically says close chat and yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1942" target="_blank">00:32:22.840</a></span> | <span class="t">okay.

I'm not sure exactly how to do that. Um, almost flawless. Yeah. Um, it did happen before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1972" target="_blank">00:32:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">while I was testing it out, but, uh, yeah, but basically, yeah, you can see here that basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1980" target="_blank">00:33:00.120</a></span> | <span class="t">there's one worker on my machine right now that can execute these kind of this workflow and these tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1984" target="_blank">00:33:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and then everything else is like, you can see the history of the execution here with every single step,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=1991" target="_blank">00:33:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like what, what was being sent, uh, what input and outputs are being given. And yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2000" target="_blank">00:33:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Um, these are, oh, I'm sorry. Sorry. How difficult is the self-host temporal?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2009" target="_blank">00:33:29.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's really easy. I've been self-hosting it for a while. It's, yeah, it's easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2016" target="_blank">00:33:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And the database is Postgres. Yeah. Um, I mean, they suggest that you use a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2026" target="_blank">00:33:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">basically. Oh yeah. And it's containerized, so you can run in Kubernetes cluster. Yes. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2034" target="_blank">00:33:54.280</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, do they use the rabbit MQ or other queue? No, it doesn't. No, it's not. It's basically all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2044" target="_blank">00:34:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the idea. You don't need to use a queue. It's all that's temporal. Temporal. No, no, no, no. But temporal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2051" target="_blank">00:34:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for example, from hatchet, I know that hatchet uses Postgres and rabbit MQ in the engine. Temporal doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2058" target="_blank">00:34:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">use a queue. It's using, it's the queues, the queues written in go. And then, and, and basically they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2066" target="_blank">00:34:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">using, they're using temporal itself to be the queue and the, the manager for all these messages. So they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2073" target="_blank">00:34:33.720</a></span> | <span class="t">don't need a separate queue to run it. They suggest for like larger applications for that, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2078" target="_blank">00:34:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">like for example, at Uber, right, they were doing global like trips, uh, they were using Cassandra</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2084" target="_blank">00:34:44.760</a></span> | <span class="t">because that's like a distributed database. They can handle these kinds of regionality of like global</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2089" target="_blank">00:34:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">workloads. But for most use cases, Postgres is just fine. I've been running with Postgres and I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2095" target="_blank">00:34:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">haven't had, uh, any issues with, with it so far. Um, and the question before going a bit into how the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2106" target="_blank">00:35:06.440</a></span> | <span class="t">demo works. Uh, I wonder how will be the sequence diagram of the code that uses temporal in terms of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2119" target="_blank">00:35:19.800</a></span> | <span class="t">what are the steps and I mean, how, uh, the code is running when we're wrapping them properly. I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2128" target="_blank">00:35:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">know if there's. Yeah. Yeah. Let's actually just move if we want to answer that. Is there any other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2133" target="_blank">00:35:33.640</a></span> | <span class="t">questions I can just move into showing that actually in just now. So yes, basically if you want to look</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2139" target="_blank">00:35:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">at what was happening in the, in the past, um, we can look at just this way of like writing an agent. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2145" target="_blank">00:35:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">basically we're almost all of our agentic workflows that a user has access to as a chat, they're all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2153" target="_blank">00:35:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">based on events where users send something, something happens from an API, the user confirms something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2159" target="_blank">00:35:59.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the chat ends, they're all events. So we have to write our application in a way that basically is written</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2165" target="_blank">00:36:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in this more asynchronous event based way where we have like kind of a main running loop. And then we,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2170" target="_blank">00:36:10.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we have signals and messages that arrive here and there. So for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2175" target="_blank">00:36:15.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in this agent, I've just, I've just abstracted a lot of things away from this, the demo that for only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2179" target="_blank">00:36:19.720</a></span> | <span class="t">for the things that are actually relevant for us. So for us, we'd have a conversation history,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2184" target="_blank">00:36:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we'd have a queue of prompts. The reason we have a queue of prompts is users can type in more prompts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2188" target="_blank">00:36:28.840</a></span> | <span class="t">while another prompt is being dealt with. Um, we have some Boolean values, like is this confirmed? Is the chat</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2198" target="_blank">00:36:38.520</a></span> | <span class="t">ended? Um, and then we have the main running loop, right? Which is basically an infinitely running loop,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2204" target="_blank">00:36:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">which says, okay, while this, uh, wait for basically these, any of these conditions to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2211" target="_blank">00:36:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">through, either there's a message, the prompt queue, or the chat has ended, or something has been like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2217" target="_blank">00:36:57.240</a></span> | <span class="t">a tool has been confirmed. Uh, then, you know, pop something from the prompt, um, from a prompt queue,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2224" target="_blank">00:37:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">if I mean, okay, I wrote this a bit wrong, but imagine that it would handle if there was a prompt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2230" target="_blank">00:37:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">message versus like a confirmed message, like a match here. Um, then you, you basically, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2236" target="_blank">00:37:16.520</a></span> | <span class="t">let's apply to the conversation history. And then you start running these activities, right? So for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2241" target="_blank">00:37:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in here we can say, okay, based on this user's prompt through the tool for it to be executed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2247" target="_blank">00:37:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like we have in the graph agent with any given the prompt input, you have some, you know, configuration</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2252" target="_blank">00:37:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">here. Like I want to try this, you know, how many times with how much interval, and I expect this to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2258" target="_blank">00:37:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">done within 60 seconds from scheduling and 30 seconds from starting. And then after you get the result,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2265" target="_blank">00:37:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you can get whatever, if for whatever tools being given by this, by this function here, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2270" target="_blank">00:37:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what, whatever tool comes back as that the agent wants to use, you can say, what's the next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2275" target="_blank">00:37:55.880</a></span> | <span class="t">step? And what's the current tool? If there's a tool, this could be none here, right? And then you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2280" target="_blank">00:38:00.760</a></span> | <span class="t">can just match the next step. Like if it's a tool use, then you can go and create, like, just execute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2285" target="_blank">00:38:05.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that, that tool. Like you can probably have, I don't know, a way to do the reflection here to maybe do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2289" target="_blank">00:38:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">another match, match tool, match next, I don't know, whatever, match tool, let's say, I know it's not a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2299" target="_blank">00:38:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">variable, whatever, case calculator, we do like, workflow execute activity method, calculator with blah, blah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2315" target="_blank">00:38:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, if there's the, if the next step is to confirm it, you go ahead and run the confirmation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2320" target="_blank">00:38:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">part of like, you know, if you're running the tool, the case is, if the next step is to end it, you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2325" target="_blank">00:38:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, end the call. The interesting part is that these signals, like how do, how do we get these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2330" target="_blank">00:38:50.360</a></span> | <span class="t">signals from the API from the front and into the workflow? We have these workflow signals here that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2335" target="_blank">00:38:55.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Temporal gives us is like another primitive, where you can say, hey, this is a signal. Whenever you receive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2341" target="_blank">00:39:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the signal, you can do these things, for example, wherever there's a new user prompt, you put in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2346" target="_blank">00:39:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">prompt queue. Whenever there's a confirm signal, just set confirm to true. Yeah, and then they give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2353" target="_blank">00:39:13.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it easy that could be defined here, right? Where, you know, you can just use them from, from this path.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2357" target="_blank">00:39:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Then in the API, all we can do is I say, okay, let's say there's a new, this is a fast API app, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2364" target="_blank">00:39:24.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I have a new send prompt. So yes, more or less. Signal and activity. So activity is a function and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2375" target="_blank">00:39:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">signal is what? Is an event. That's an event. It's something that happens, right? A trigger, an event,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2381" target="_blank">00:39:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, something, a new prompt arrives, a new message arrives from an API. It's just a way to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2389" target="_blank">00:39:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a way to basically interrupt the execution or like to provide ways to enter the context of the workflow,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2395" target="_blank">00:39:55.560</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Because the workflow like runs wherever is a run loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2399" target="_blank">00:39:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And the logic to handle signals is an execution activity method, execute activity method,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2405" target="_blank">00:40:05.960</a></span> | <span class="t">right? What do you do with those? That's a nice, that's a nice part about it. Because that's a nice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2412" target="_blank">00:40:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">part about it is you can kind of decouple these signals from your, you can just write Python,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2417" target="_blank">00:40:17.320</a></span> | <span class="t">right? This prompt queue here is just like an actual asyncio queue, right? So you don't need to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2424" target="_blank">00:40:24.520</a></span> | <span class="t">so when you're running your workflow, the nice thing about it is you don't have to think about what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2427" target="_blank">00:40:27.800</a></span> | <span class="t">signals are coming. You can just like write it so that, you know, I am, what I, what I know, I want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2434" target="_blank">00:40:34.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to run a workflow. I want to wait until the user has something to say, or so the user has confirmed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2440" target="_blank">00:40:40.680</a></span> | <span class="t">something from a tool use. I don't care when it, when the user does that or how they do that. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2445" target="_blank">00:40:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">just, I'm just going to wait forever until they give me something. And then even the other part is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2449" target="_blank">00:40:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like, how do you get that something, right? Which is the signal. It's a signal. So for example, here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2456" target="_blank">00:40:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I said define the user prompt can provide, it can, is a signal that can basically, when it, when it receives</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2461" target="_blank">00:41:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that signal, right? It will put something on the queue. So then, because it's, it's running on, on the event loop,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2469" target="_blank">00:41:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">when the event loop goes back to the, you know, main running loop, it'll be like, hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2472" target="_blank">00:41:12.760</a></span> | <span class="t">there's something in the queue. I'll pop it from the queue and then continue the execution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2476" target="_blank">00:41:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Same with the confirm signal, right? Then the pretty nice thing about it, you just have to write Python</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2482" target="_blank">00:41:22.520</a></span> | <span class="t">or go or whatever you want. And it's minimal how much you have to think about these kind of like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2487" target="_blank">00:41:27.560</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff outside of your core logic, right? So it's nice to build very decoupled applications with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2495" target="_blank">00:41:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But those signals are within the scope of the workflow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2500" target="_blank">00:41:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, what do you mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2505" target="_blank">00:41:45.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Like here, you have self-confirm and self-prom, that self is the instance of workflow plus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2511" target="_blank">00:41:51.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Correct, correct, correct. But this, this is the thing is like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2515" target="_blank">00:41:55.160</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, as long as these are serializable, right? Which most objects that we use are serializable in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2523" target="_blank">00:42:03.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the context of AI, right? Even the, even, I think I'm not gonna, I know it's probably gonna be confusing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2530" target="_blank">00:42:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Even, uh, you can provide custom serialize, they've serialized for objects that you cannot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2536" target="_blank">00:42:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">serialize by default, right? But anyways, besides the point, yes, these are living inside the Python</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2541" target="_blank">00:42:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">context and they're all within these, um, where is it? I can't see this. They're all within the workflow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2549" target="_blank">00:42:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">context, serialized. Yeah. So you can just, you can just continue to treat them as Python objects</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2556" target="_blank">00:42:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">as long as you want, right? Like I can say here after this tool use,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2560" target="_blank">00:42:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I can just basically like, okay, uh, no, sorry, here case confirm. I can just stealth confirmed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2565" target="_blank">00:42:45.480</a></span> | <span class="t">equals false, right? After I've done my logic to execute. So then I can just put it to false.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2569" target="_blank">00:42:49.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And then when a new single comes, this is gonna set it back to true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2573" target="_blank">00:42:53.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2575" target="_blank">00:42:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, these activities are just like, as I kind of like skeleton just kind of provide how these,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2581" target="_blank">00:43:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, for example, here I'm using the agent activities tools, but I think we implemented</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2587" target="_blank">00:43:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">something very similar, right? When we have these kind of like different calculator</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2589" target="_blank">00:43:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">tools and, uh, so they actually use Python code that runs for the tool, but how do we get it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2596" target="_blank">00:43:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">from the API side into those? How do we get the signals into that? Um, we basically just, uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2604" target="_blank">00:43:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we have workflow ID, which in our case would be something like conversation ID in, uh, spark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2610" target="_blank">00:43:30.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And in this case is called single will start. I'm not going into it, but you can reference it. Uh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2616" target="_blank">00:43:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">we just say, okay, temporal start this workflow agent run this input and this workflow ID.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2621" target="_blank">00:43:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">What single would start means is like, if this workflow is not running, start it. And if the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2628" target="_blank">00:43:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">workflow is running already, just send the signal. So basically in the beginning, it will basically,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2634" target="_blank">00:43:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">if the workflow is not, does not exist, right? It's not started. It was, it will just start a new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2639" target="_blank">00:43:59.160</a></span> | <span class="t">workflow. And the first start signal it sends is a user prompt. And the prompt will be this. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2645" target="_blank">00:44:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">basically whenever the user, whenever the workflow starts, it already has the signal in, the signal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2651" target="_blank">00:44:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">already runs and it depends on the queue. So then when this part runs here, it will have something to pop</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2657" target="_blank">00:44:17.160</a></span> | <span class="t">from the queue and continue with the execution. But then when we send another, another message to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2661" target="_blank">00:44:21.800</a></span> | <span class="t">same conversation, it won't start the same workflow. It will just basically go ahead and, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2667" target="_blank">00:44:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it will just go ahead and give a signal to it, right? It will just, the board will still be the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2673" target="_blank">00:44:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">workflow. We'll just get a signal. I think it's easier to kind of see in the confirmment and chat,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2681" target="_blank">00:44:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">things, right? In the, uh, stuff where we send the confirmation. We, we fetch that, that workflow by the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2689" target="_blank">00:44:49.240</a></span> | <span class="t">workflow ID, in our case would be the conversation ID. And then we'll just say, okay, that handle dot signal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2695" target="_blank">00:44:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and then send a confirm signal, uh, I think for, for the end, right? So that's a way to get stuff into the workflow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2703" target="_blank">00:45:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and you don't have to worry about, you know, when this comes back as a response, whatever, it's all managed by,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2709" target="_blank">00:45:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">back and forth. Okay, James, go. Um, so I was just assuming that, so the, basically on the API side,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2719" target="_blank">00:45:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you're going to send the first endpoint name. I can't remember what it was called, but you're going to hit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2723" target="_blank">00:45:23.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that first endpoint. Then that is going to, yes, send prompt. Then that's going to go through, start the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2730" target="_blank">00:45:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">workflow. Then it's going to wait for you to hit the confirm endpoint, right? So that, that send prompt</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2737" target="_blank">00:45:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">endpoint is the front end is still waiting for that. Uh, but then you send the confirm confirmation and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2744" target="_blank">00:45:44.680</a></span> | <span class="t">then that triggers that, that sends a signal to the other workflow and the other workflow completes and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2750" target="_blank">00:45:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">then sends the response to the original. Um, so yeah, I think if we take the demo example I gave that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2759" target="_blank">00:45:59.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it's just one workflow in the entire conversations with one workflow. So initially when I started that, it was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2765" target="_blank">00:46:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">basically because the workflow didn't exist, the pro was like, I can't signal this work workflow, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2770" target="_blank">00:46:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">it's, I, I, I, you know, I have to start up. So I have to start it. Yes. And then when I keep talking to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2776" target="_blank">00:46:16.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it, it's like, well, this, the work, this workflow with this workflow ID exists, but then I, I just,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2781" target="_blank">00:46:21.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I will just add to it. So for example, even if the, if, for example, if we, if a user has a conversation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2786" target="_blank">00:46:26.520</a></span> | <span class="t">ID from like two years ago, right. That, that workflow still exists, the workflow still exists. Um, you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2794" target="_blank">00:46:34.440</a></span> | <span class="t">let it running forever if you want to, if the user hasn't decided to end the chat and even like two years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2799" target="_blank">00:46:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">from now, when the new, when the convers that the user decides to continue our conversation two years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2804" target="_blank">00:46:44.360</a></span> | <span class="t">ago, Hey, this workflow actually exists. I just need to like send us a new signal for a new prompt and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2809" target="_blank">00:46:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">then continue the execution from there. Um, yeah. And then I think what you were mentioning about it, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2817" target="_blank">00:46:57.480</a></span> | <span class="t">don't have to confirm it every single time. It's just how the current example is being written. You can,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2821" target="_blank">00:47:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">you can, for example, say, well, I have a prompt now from this prompt. I want to do query expansion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2828" target="_blank">00:47:08.600</a></span> | <span class="t">for all these expansion. I want to do some queries, some search, blah, blah, and then provide the answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2832" target="_blank">00:47:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">back or, or, you know, we can even have multiple agents. You can have multiple workflows. You can start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2837" target="_blank">00:47:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">workflows as child workflows. So you can have multiple edges working together for once a single prompt where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2844" target="_blank">00:47:24.200</a></span> | <span class="t">they pass in signals between each other and query each other to see the result to actually give a response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2850" target="_blank">00:47:30.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's kind of like the sky's the limit. You can go as complex as you want with these kind of work</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2854" target="_blank">00:47:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">workflows and how you can query and send single between the work workflows. And that's where I think, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2859" target="_blank">00:47:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I generally think we should go to, uh, Temporal be like, Hey, do you guys want to do dev role?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2866" target="_blank">00:47:46.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I think Temporal is goaded for AI agentic workflows. Yeah. Um, yeah. Um, yeah.

It's just Temporal and here lies objects. I look at to see if there's a limit. I haven't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2930" target="_blank">00:48:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">seen one, but I haven't really tried to read the element.

Let's say we add</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=2953" target="_blank">00:49:13.160</a></span> | <span class="t">another function to, uh, our agent, which is a annotated with a query.

So we don't even need to send the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3004" target="_blank">00:50:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">conversation history to the database.

I would imagine it's complicated,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3024" target="_blank">00:50:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">especially if you think with like, how would you do a migration of what is stored within the history here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3032" target="_blank">00:50:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, I think that this, that's handled by the, that's handled by the Temporal, but I, I, this is more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3039" target="_blank">00:50:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">an advanced workflow.

Um, you don't have to use it. Right. But you can use this kind of like, you can't, you can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3049" target="_blank">00:50:49.800</a></span> | <span class="t">write workflows just thinking about the workflow itself without having to think about where I'm saving</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3056" target="_blank">00:50:56.280</a></span> | <span class="t">stuff. So when I want to see, for example, for, for an order for a, for a, you know, a shipment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3061" target="_blank">00:51:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">if that's pending, that's the status of that, um, order is pending in Temporal and it's waiting for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3068" target="_blank">00:51:08.440</a></span> | <span class="t">other updates, I can just query the workflow directly instead of like having to keep updating the database.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3074" target="_blank">00:51:14.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And if, if there's a race condition in the database, there's, uh, you know, what, what happens</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3079" target="_blank">00:51:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">if the work work, uh, the update of the database state failed, you know, you don't have to like worry</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3086" target="_blank">00:51:26.760</a></span> | <span class="t">about those. You only have to worry about the workflow itself. Yeah. Um, just like very quick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3093" target="_blank">00:51:33.880</a></span> | <span class="t">question. Yeah. Like with the conversation example, um, would you be able to say, is that like an expiry,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3102" target="_blank">00:51:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like an inactive, um, expiry on a workflow? So if it's been inactive for like a week, would you be able</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3108" target="_blank">00:51:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to, um, trigger, um, trigger like an event, which would then save that to a database if you wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3119" target="_blank">00:51:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">to. So then basically wait till it would be inactive before you go and do that. Uh, yeah. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3126" target="_blank">00:52:06.040</a></span> | <span class="t">this would be the application database, right? Not the temporal database. So basically with temporal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3135" target="_blank">00:52:15.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the database is the state of the workflow, right? Because these workflows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3138" target="_blank">00:52:18.520</a></span> | <span class="t">can be paused for infinite time. They're not holding up any compute compute. So that's going to be said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3144" target="_blank">00:52:24.120</a></span> | <span class="t">automatically through the database conversation industry, right? If you do want to stop a workflow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3148" target="_blank">00:52:28.520</a></span> | <span class="t">after a certain amount of time, you can, there is a way, um, it's not documented here and I haven't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3152" target="_blank">00:52:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">screwed it here, but, um, in the, uh, when you start a workflow, you can say, you can set a policy of how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3160" target="_blank">00:52:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">long you want to wait, uh, for this workflow to finish. And then if it doesn't finish in the, during that time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3167" target="_blank">00:52:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">temporal is going to like, uh, kill it, terminate it automatically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3171" target="_blank">00:52:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But is, is there a way of like, not just killing it, but, uh, running like some finishing logic and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3179" target="_blank">00:52:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">then killing it. I, I imagine there is, I haven't looked into it, but I'm, I imagine there is a way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3184" target="_blank">00:53:04.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to do it, um, by hooking it to these, you know, events like termination events. But you have to think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3192" target="_blank">00:53:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">if you're using the temporal to store the state by the workflow state, you just have to think about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3196" target="_blank">00:53:16.840</a></span> | <span class="t">it. Like the data, the state is unified, right? So there's no such thing as like saving to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3202" target="_blank">00:53:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">history. When you're querying the Python object, that's actually the state in the database.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3206" target="_blank">00:53:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So can the worker be like serverless of one time, like I know in prefect, there is like task runner,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3223" target="_blank">00:53:43.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which basically, once you have a task or a step or activity in this terminology, it will spin up a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3231" target="_blank">00:53:51.560</a></span> | <span class="t">camaraderie this job. It will do the job. It will kill the folder.

Right. Um, I mean, you can, you can, there is metrics. So basically the ball exposes a metrics</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3251" target="_blank">00:54:11.560</a></span> | <span class="t">server, uh, like this, it's a Prometheus metrics. And you can like scale based on those metrics,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3256" target="_blank">00:54:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like queue size and all these kinds of things. But then I, I, I'm not sure about like the, I haven't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3261" target="_blank">00:54:21.080</a></span> | <span class="t">looked at the serverless stuff, but, um, yeah, you can just scale to zero and then using those metrics</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3267" target="_blank">00:54:27.640</a></span> | <span class="t">can bring up, if you're using KEDA, right? If you, for example, it means these kind of metrics about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3272" target="_blank">00:54:32.760</a></span> | <span class="t">queue, each queue size and the queue goes to zero, you can scale your, your worker to zero. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3281" target="_blank">00:54:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not sure. I don't think Temporal has a good to use serverless stuff like Cloud Run because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3288" target="_blank">00:54:48.360</a></span> | <span class="t">No, not, not Cloud Run, in Kubernetes job. I'm not seeing just a certain example, just, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3295" target="_blank">00:54:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I sent to process the document in spin-ups Kubernetes job with restriction of the resources. It will finish</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3301" target="_blank">00:55:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and release the resources basically to the cluster. I mean, yeah, you can, you can do that, but you do it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3309" target="_blank">00:55:09.960</a></span> | <span class="t">via KEDA, right?

I think for heavier, all like loads,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3318" target="_blank">00:55:18.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, yeah, if you do it via KEDA or if you do it via job, it's kind of same, same. I just think like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3324" target="_blank">00:55:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">a worker can run multiple, multiple requests at a time or multiple tasks at a time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3333" target="_blank">00:55:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so it doesn't have to be every single job is a task.

Um, I could do a part two,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3413" target="_blank">00:56:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">if you are interested in, we'd go into like some more advanced stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3415" target="_blank">00:56:55.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. That's really good demo. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. It's not my demo. It's the demo</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3422" target="_blank">00:57:02.680</a></span> | <span class="t">from temporal. I took it because it's no, no, but whole workflow and understand the way it fits this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3428" target="_blank">00:57:08.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like technology. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think it's great. I think it's, uh, this, this came up before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3434" target="_blank">00:57:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">um, a, authentic AI. And when like authentic AI was booming, I was like temporal, I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3439" target="_blank">00:57:19.480</a></span> | <span class="t">all in on temporal. It's like, yeah. Luca. I actually didn't want to raise my hand. I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3448" target="_blank">00:57:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">know how I did it. Okay. Okay. I can't put it down. Okay. Now I did it. Okay. Sorry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3455" target="_blank">00:57:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">You think to, um, like one of the thoughts I had, I think before when you took like explain temporal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3465" target="_blank">00:57:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but also now is if we took some, if we took like graph AI, it's like some, so the foundation of a AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3476" target="_blank">00:57:56.680</a></span> | <span class="t">framework and just like kits that out with temporal would that, yeah, I was actually trying to make a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3484" target="_blank">00:58:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, I was doing this on a, on a, on a random weekend when I was like thinking, like, can I make</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3489" target="_blank">00:58:09.480</a></span> | <span class="t">an extension to temporal to allow these kind of like graphs deformed? I haven't found a good way yet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3496" target="_blank">00:58:16.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but I've, I've been looking at it. Yeah. Yeah. Cause that, that could be like a sort of prediction</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3504" target="_blank">00:58:24.440</a></span> | <span class="t">ready, more robust graph AI would be pretty. Yeah. Yeah. And that'd be great. I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3512" target="_blank">00:58:32.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I think Tempo always really liked that too, because they're, they're really, really pushing just AI stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3516" target="_blank">00:58:36.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. But yeah, I think it's a great technology. It's really nice to work with. I think it's basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3525" target="_blank">00:58:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">shifts the burden more on people like me and someone else who are like running it, but, um, or, and also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3532" target="_blank">00:58:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like, it's not very cheap to run, to use the cloud version. Um, but it's not actually that hard to run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3538" target="_blank">00:58:58.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I was, I thought it'd be hard. It's not actually that hard to run.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3540" target="_blank">00:59:00.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This, yeah. The self-hosted version is completely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3552" target="_blank">00:59:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">deeper parity. Yeah. They're basically betting on the fact that people don't really know how to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3558" target="_blank">00:59:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">host the database side of things. I think that's, I think the smallest part here is like the most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3564" target="_blank">00:59:24.360</a></span> | <span class="t">consequential is that if you have like globally distributed workflows, there are millions of users</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3570" target="_blank">00:59:30.120</a></span> | <span class="t">and billions of actions a day, then like the databases have been the biggest bottleneck as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3574" target="_blank">00:59:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">we're talking about, like how that there's like that object parity with a database for the state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3578" target="_blank">00:59:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, yeah. So that's why they recommend using Sandra and all these more esoteric databases that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3584" target="_blank">00:59:44.840</a></span> | <span class="t">not many people, you know how to use, but then they're like, well, we're just going to offer you a cloud</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3588" target="_blank">00:59:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">version to use. Okay. Okay. Makes sense. Nice. Yeah. Uh, I'll, I'll need to go by the way. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3599" target="_blank">00:59:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, if it's finished, uh, yeah, yeah, it's finished. I already overrun by like 10 minutes and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3605" target="_blank">01:00:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">okay.

It's basically the engineers left Uber and they just like, would you just start this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3618" target="_blank">01:00:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">They basically took their learnings from like what they were doing at Uber. And they're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3623" target="_blank">01:00:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not sure how Uber didn't come after them for that. Maybe they had a good relations and they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14vQqJ9WG6U&t=3627" target="_blank">01:00:27.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like, okay, we, we, we're chill.
