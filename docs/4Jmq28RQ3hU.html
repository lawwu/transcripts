So I'm going to show you that and I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">explain what we're actually going to go through and I think we're going to cover a lot of different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">things. So I think that is one of the reasons why I think this is such a cool project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So at the moment this is like the basic architecture of what we would need to build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a Q&A model and the end goal is to have a front end which looks kind of like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we'll have like a search bar here and we'll have some visual up here. It's going to be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=87" target="_blank">00:01:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit better than the sigma and I'm going to show you what I already have and maybe we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">can use that or maybe we'll do something different I don't know. And what we're going to be able to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">do is ask a question here and we're going to be able to answer the question based on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">stoic philosophy books. So I haven't really read any of these, I've read like little bits</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">but they're pretty interesting and I think quite unique. So as far as I know there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">definitely not anything like this out there at the moment where you ask a question and you get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the answer back from some ancient stoic philosophy book. And there's only really two books that I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">thought of so far which is Meditations by Marcus Aurelius and Letters from a Stoic by Seneca.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And the good thing with both of these is that we can find both of them online for free so we can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">use Python requests to get these. So I'll just kind of put a little list here of what I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">we're going to need. So the first one is actually extracting and downloading this data so we'll be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">using requests for that. And then once we have actually got that data we need to pre-process it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and when we're pre-processing it I think that will just be a case of using Regex</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">more than anything else but I'm not sure yet so let's see. So after we pre-process it and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">that's when we get into this stuff over here. So this whole sort of stack that you can see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">without the API. So this is a typical, it's called a reader or retriever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">reader and what we do is we use this up here, this is our database, it's a document store,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Elasticsearch document store and what we're going to do is feed all of these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Sorry it's getting a little bit messy with the color so let me change it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we're going to do is take these and we're going to feed them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.840</a></span> | <span class="t">into our document store and once we have that what we want to do is build this retriever reader</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">stack and it will allow us to query the retriever down here and what the retriever will do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is send that query to Elasticsearch here which is what you can see happening there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And returning from that we'll get so many different contexts. So all of the text from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">meditations and letters from Stoic, we'll split them up by maybe paragraph and saw them in here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=283" target="_blank">00:04:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and what these contexts will be are the most relevant paragraphs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And once we've done that, this retriever will pass on the context to our reader model down here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and what the reader model will do is say it's given a long sentence like this or paragraph,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it will say okay the actual answer that you want is actually only these three words here and it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">will return those three words and what we want to do is return those three words in our answer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">back to our API. But alongside the answer we're also going to include the full context here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">as well. So we get a few things back and I think that that's like going to be the more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">machine learning side of it but obviously we need to support all the machine learning side</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and I mean the very first part of that that you can obviously see here is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">API. So let me so let me write down so we have the the ML part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">and for that we're going to be using something called haystack.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And once we get out of that part we move on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm just going to use a different color here, move on to our API.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=375" target="_blank">00:06:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The API we'll just we'll use probably fast API to set that up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then once we set that up we go on to our front end part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and the front end I don't I'm not a front end developer I just mainly use Python but I do know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Angular a little bit. So what we're going to do is build all of this part using Angular.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So this will be our Angular front end and that's essentially everything we'll be covering but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=418" target="_blank">00:06:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">there's you know there's quite a lot in here. In particular as well what I've missed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is alongside you know we have our reader model down here but what I want to try and do is rather</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=432" target="_blank">00:07:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">than just taking the reader model from Hugging Face Transformers as we normally would, I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">actually try training it and for that we need to use something called MLM which is mass language</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">modeling.

So that is what we're going to be covering in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of the next few videos and the one other final little thing. Okay so over here we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jmq28RQ3hU&t=501" target="_blank">00:08:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">the Marcus Aurelius Sit-Man and I thought maybe something like this would be cool.
