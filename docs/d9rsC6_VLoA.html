So, today we'll be talking basically about CISO-approved Agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=20" target="_blank">00:00:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Fleet Architecture. So, my name is Lou. I'll actually jump into that. So, my name is Lou.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=25" target="_blank">00:00:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I am a field TTO at a company called Gitpod. In a past life, you know, for many years, basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=31" target="_blank">00:00:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">software engineering and platform engineering is my background, but for the last four years,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">actually nearly four years, I've been working at Gitpod effectively building a platform for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">automated development environments. What I'm going to talk about today is actually the journey over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the last, even extends beyond my tenure at the company for the last sort of six years, building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">our sort of product infrastructure and architecture for secure environments, particularly around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=55" target="_blank">00:00:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">regulated industries and that kind of thing. I assume they'll probably, in fact, actually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I'm already on the next slide. So, yeah. So, in terms of like who this talk is for,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">so different aspects. So, first aspect is really about how do we start to think about how technical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">architectures of product affect our business. If you're a vendor, this is obviously something for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you. There are probably a bunch of people here as well that are either building or consuming or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking about AI tools, maybe also in these secure environments. But then also, if you're a buyer of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this as well, I think this talk will also be interesting if you're buying, using or consuming</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">AI tools, thinking about like what architectures might be right for you and what considerations you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">might want to take throughout that process. So, let's go ahead and actually just jump into it. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for a little bit of context, it's very hard to talk about this talk without actually giving a bit of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">background to the company and what we do. So, Gitpod is basically a platform for secure dev environments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of people sometimes mix this up with things like staging or integration environments,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">things like that. But to give you an idea like developers actually work inside of Gitpod for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">around 37 hours a week, 36, 37 hours. So, like you're, it's almost like a replacement, I suppose,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like for your machine or your laptop, something like that. So, as a consequence of that as well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it's highly mission critical software. So, if Gitpod goes down, that has a huge impact for our customers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's really important that this is incredibly reliable. In addition to that, what we effectively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">do is because the automated aspects of our dev environments, we run also mostly with highly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">secure regulated organizations. So, banks, pharmaceutical, healthcare. A lot of the companies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that we work with as well, like are quite particular about like their logo rights and publishing some of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">their names. But for sure, it's a lot of companies that you will know, a lot of household names and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=155" target="_blank">00:02:35.760</a></span> | <span class="t">things like that as well. So, as you can imagine, building this type of product and actually bringing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it to market is not an insignificant task, especially if you're a smaller company with sort of limited</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">resources trying to do that. And in addition to that as well, I'll talk about this a little bit later,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">but we actually launched and talked more publicly about our agent offering two days ago, but we've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">been building this for months with some of our design customers as well. And I'll get onto that and how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">how that interfaces with the architecture as well. So, just as an overview, and I'll actually deep dive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">into these a little bit as we go through, is we've gone through various iterations of different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">architectural models and they have different implications for us as a company, but also for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">our customers, the implications on, for instance, how much ownership they have over those products,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">like the cost of running those products, and the security as well of actually when they run them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So, very quickly, because I will actually deep dive on these. So, we started off 2019 with a managed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=213" target="_blank">00:03:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">SaaS product. It's where a lot of products start, hosted on the internet, multi-tenant. You can go,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you click on the website, you swipe a credit card, you can use the product. Wonderful. But this doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">work for secure companies, right? So, we went through several iterations, first with a very self-hosted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">architectural approach. We then adjusted that, and I'll talk about exactly how, and then we have what we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">effectively have today, which is also the platform that we run our agent fleet architecture on, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=238" target="_blank">00:03:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll talk about how that works as well. So, if we start at the beginning with our sort of fully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">managed SaaS, and I don't know if any of you know Sean, but it's funny, because I remembered this tweet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the other day that he put out several years ago. It's like, Gitpod really inspired him to do a video,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">because it has a nice time to wow, which is, you know, Gitpod was very well known. You click on a link,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and you end up in a dev environment literally from one-click interaction. This was, at the time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">hosted on top of GCP, Kubernetes architecture. We chose GCP, obviously, for the connection with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Kubernetes. And the way the dev environments were then orchestrated was pods running inside of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=274" target="_blank">00:04:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Kubernetes. So, multi-tenant infrastructure, but if you know anything about Kubernetes, it's not really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">designed for that type of workload, and we will talk a bit about that as we go on. But obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">there are several challenges with this type of approach. One, it's great to get started really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">easy to use your product, but we had a ton of crypto mining and abuse on this. It's one of these things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">like, we can't have nice things on the internet, like, where we give away free compute, because somebody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">always wants to do something. Always wants to abuse it, effectively. But it's not also just insufficient</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">for enterprise. And one of the goals of Gitpod was really to bring our product to professional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">developers doing real-world work in real companies. So, what do we do? What's the next step? The obvious,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">almost like the logical thing there is just, okay, can we take our existing architecture, take that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">package that up as a self-hosted installation, and just give that to our customers? So, we tried it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">We did do exactly that. We didn't think too much necessarily about, let's say, the specifics of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">cloud provider support. So, we kind of opened this up for Google. I think we had AWS at the time and some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of the others. And, you know, we had all manner of them requests from different companies with all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">their different flavors of Kubernetes and different configurations to try and figure out how do we then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">self-host on those platforms. In the fullness of time, though, what this came up with, both for us as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">a vendor, but also for our customers, is significant day two effects. So, self-hosting is great as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">general model, but it comes also with this huge overhead. Typically, you have to set it up. You have to run it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, as a business also, that ultimately is, like, your cost of ownership. So, as a company,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">like, we're ultimately selling a product to our customers. Having a very difficult product to set</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">up and run is effectively eroding your ROI. If you need to allocate two, three, maybe even a whole team</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to actually set up and run this infrastructure, then the benefit that you're getting from that product is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">also being eroded. The difficulty with that as well is then we don't have a strong relationship with the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">people that are actually using or running that product. That's also really important, especially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">in an enterprise sort of situation. How you adopt and roll out the product can be critical to its</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=396" target="_blank">00:06:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">success. And oftentimes, we found that, you know, especially in a self-hosted model without support</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">from our side, some of those people that are trying to adopt the product also are unsuccessful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So, considering that with the self-hosted model, what did we do next? So, we looked at this ownership</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and this sort of overhead challenge and said, okay, we can solve this by effectively providing what we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">call the substrate so that we could allow customers to self-host, but then we could also manage the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">service. So, we could take away some of that overhead. But in order to do that, we also needed to reduce</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">variance. So, one of the things that we did is we effectively doubled down on AWS as the individual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">provider, where we run the infrastructure, but then we would then manage it. So, that meant small</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">pieces of telemetry data, other things that we needed to operate that infrastructure were still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">being emitted to us as a provider. But what it still meant is the workload, or in our case, source code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">data, integrations, all still live on the customer's infrastructure, which is then still ticking the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">box when it comes to these regulated companies. But despite this being a success, certainly from an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=462" target="_blank">00:07:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">operational standpoint, it still continued to have effectively fundamental issues because it's still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=466" target="_blank">00:07:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">built on this sort of Kubernetes-based infrastructure, still highly complicated, let's say even when you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">want to install. In this case, we're running multiple clusters with a high fixed cost, let's say, and also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">still a lot of complexity. This ultimately culminated in its moving away for Kubernetes for our specific use case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I put this blog post up because it goes into a lot of a lot of detail specifically about why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Kubernetes was particularly challenging for us and our use case and our workloads.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But we decided to move away from that and start to think from first principles about what an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">architecture looks like that solves this challenge of running inside of regulated companies, running</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">highly securely, but doing so in a way that doesn't create a huge operational burden for our customers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">which is bad for them and bad for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So ultimately, this is actually the architecture that we came up with and that we have today that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">also running our AI agent fleet. So I'll just run you through this real quick. So we have what we call</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">effectively like a runner. And if you're an engineer, maybe you're probably familiar with this, like tools like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">GitHub CI as well has like this runner. The runner takes everything that's secure. So in our case, source code and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">access to data and runs that on the customer's infrastructure. A runner is actually very,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=539" target="_blank">00:08:59.520</a></span> | <span class="t">very simple in our case. The runner is actually a single ECS task. So it's a single container running.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And it obviously then costs like, we're talking dollars, single figures of dollars to run every month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=549" target="_blank">00:09:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The core workload that we spin up is then dev environments. Each runner runs on a different,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in our case, this is AWS. But if we, you know, for our Linux runner, they inherit the qualities of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">platform they're running on. So for AWS, we run workloads on top of EC2, and those are also then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">backed up to EBS. So we can use the native functionality and features of the cloud provider to build that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">solution rather than something like Kubernetes, which is theoretically portable, but it also comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">with all of that overhead and complexity of having the portability across different platforms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Then what we did is then also start to think about, okay, so what are the things that we can keep on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">our side as a vendor so that our customers aren't taking on a significant amount of operational</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">overhead? So a lot of that is like metadata, IDs, information about users, et cetera. Not personally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">identify information, but like user IDs, like stuff that if you were to get your hands on it, it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=604" target="_blank">00:10:04.160</a></span> | <span class="t">particularly significant for our customers. They're not bothered about losing that. They're bothered about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">losing the IP, the source code things that's running actually inside their infrastructure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=611" target="_blank">00:10:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So I did actually throw in a quick video here because I'm going to turn off the audio on this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">just as you actually see what this looks like from a user experience point of view. So this is actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the user choosing their workload. When they choose those, those actually do run inside of their network,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">inside of their cloud account. To then set up and install on their side, what we're able to now do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.600</a></span> | <span class="t">is provide them with this runner interface, creates a very simple cloud formation, ask the customer to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">through and actually put in all of their different network details. That bit is all on their side, create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">this. The process of running this, it takes as little as three minutes. The overhead or the challenge is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">usually getting all of that network configuration, VPC information, subnets, finding out who in your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">organization owns those who can actually allocate them to you. But fundamentally, this makes it then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">exceptionally simple to then deploy that for customers. And the overhead of this is then is also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">significantly reduced. Just one second. I think I have to back out of this to change it. There we go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool. So I mean, we're at an agent conference. So I also presume I should certainly be talking about AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and agents. So two days ago, I mentioned we basically launched our agent offering, which we've been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">working on for months now since the start of the year, actually, with customers and our design partners.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, because we have that existing infrastructure already within those customers, we can actually run the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">exact same workloads. So because we create dev environments, dev environments are effectively for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">humans to be productive. But everything that an autonomous agent needs to operate is exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=711" target="_blank">00:11:51.520</a></span> | <span class="t">the same thing that a dev does. They need the source code. They need access to internal systems,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">whether that be an internal database, a cluster, etc. So when you give an agent the ability to access</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">source code and iterate, it can do it inside of that same dev environment with the same access and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">privileges that an individual human would as well. Because of like our target market and the customers we go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=733" target="_blank">00:12:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">forward that our agent offering as well is also privacy first, because what we've effectively built here allows us to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">not only run inside the customers infrastructure, but there's lots of other additional benefits that come from that as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's say things like audit logs. Once we did that, and I'll just jump back a few slides. Once we re-architected to this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">architecture, one of the other first principles that we came back to is building this in an API first way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So every action interaction when you spin up a dev environment, everything that you do is then audit logs and allows us to give</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">our customers also an entire sort of audit history on the platform, which also then extends to once you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9rsC6_VLoA&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.440</a></span> | <span class="t">start running these workloads with agents, you also benefit from that as well.
