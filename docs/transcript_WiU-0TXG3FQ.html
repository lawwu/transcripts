And I don't just mean smart on the court, though obviously that, but smart more broadly, and that this is underrated. I think Michelle Dawson was the one who talked me into this, but absolutely, I'm with you all the way.</p><p>Do you think it's just mutational load or like the actual act of-- I think you actually have to be really smart to figure out how to lead a team, how to improve yourself, how to practice, how to outsmart the opposition, all these other things. Maybe not the only way to get there, but very G-loaded.</p><p>Interesting. And you certainly see some super talented athletes who just go bust, or they may destroy themselves with drugs, or there's plenty of tales like that. You don't have to look hard.</p></div></div></body></html>
