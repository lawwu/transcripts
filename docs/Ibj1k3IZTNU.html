style="max-width: 800px;"><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=0" target="_blank">00:00:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5" target="_blank">00:00:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=15" target="_blank">00:00:15.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Today, we are discussing cortisol, in particular, how to control your cortisol in order to avoid burnout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=21" target="_blank">00:00:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Or, should you already be feeling burnt out, how to overcome burnout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=26" target="_blank">00:00:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, it's hard for me to overemphasize just how important cortisol is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=30" target="_blank">00:00:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, in the late stages of preparing for this episode, it dawned on me that if ever there were an episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast that people could benefit from in terms of their health and well-being, this would be that episode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And I say that because, as you'll soon learn, cortisol, the biology of it, how it impacts your mood, your sleep, your immune system, your overall feelings of well-being, not just in the moment, but over the long term, and your ability to control cortisol at different portions of the day and night, makes it one of the most, if not the most powerful levers for your health and well-being.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I'm very excited to get into the material for today's discussion about cortisol, how to control it, and how to avoid and overcome burnout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.740</a></span> | <span class="t">In keeping with that theme, today's episode does include sponsors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, let's discuss cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I believe that most people have heard of cortisol, and most everyone that hears the word cortisol hears it somewhere nearby the word stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And it makes sense why you would hear about cortisol in that context, because, indeed, cortisol is a hormone that's made and released in response to stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the problem with thinking about cortisol simply as a stress hormone is that it's doing a lot of other things unrelated to stress that are super important and positive for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">However, it all depends on how high your cortisol levels are and when.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So, during today's discussion, there's going to be a very prominent theme, which is your cortisol rhythm, or more particularly, your 24-hour, so-called circadian rhythm in cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's the important first thing to remember.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.220</a></span> | <span class="t">You want your cortisol high early in the day, shortly after waking, and you want your cortisol low in the hours right before sleep and in the first hours of sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.380</a></span> | <span class="t">If you remember nothing else from this episode, please remember that, because if you get those two things correct, everything else in terms of health and wellness and performance, all of that will be reinforced by getting your cortisol rhythm correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So, today, I will explain how to get your cortisol rhythm correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=160" target="_blank">00:02:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I will also explain what stress does to cortisol in the short term, which turns out to be good for you, and in the long term, if you're dealing with long bouts of stress associated with what eventually becomes burnout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's also important for me to point out that if you're already feeling wired and tired and burnt out, if you don't have energy in the morning, or if you somehow have low energy all day, but then at night you can't sleep, this is very typical of burnout, or if you have morning anxiety, literally all of that can be resolved, perhaps not entirely, but mostly, and in some cases entirely, by fixing your cortisol rhythm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So, okay, so to understand and control your cortisol, the first thing you really need to know is that cortisol, again, is not a stress hormone per se, rather, cortisol is involved in deploying and directing energy to tissues that need it most.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, I'll say that again, cortisol is not a stress hormone per se, cortisol should be thought of as a hormone that causes the deployment of energy into the body, and helps direct that energy to particular tissues, especially your brain, in order to deal with, yes, stressors, but all sorts of other things that demand your energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the way to think about cortisol is that it causes the release of glucose, blood sugar into the bloodstream, and it does that by controlling energy release from the liver, and from the muscles, but cortisol is not made in the brain, cortisol is made in your adrenal glands, and of course the adrenals are associated with adrenaline, also called epinephrine, those are the same thing, by the way, epinephrine and adrenaline, and your adrenals will release epinephrine, aka adrenaline, in response to a stressor very quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Your adrenals can also release cortisol in response to a stressor, but it needs to make that cortisol first, and then release it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, cortisol acts on a slightly slower timescale to deal with stress, and as I mentioned before, cortisol isn't just about stress, cortisol is also about generating energy to deal with pretty much anything that requires energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when you need energy to deal with stress, to deal with getting out of bed in the morning, to deal with a hard school task, work task,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.360</a></span> | <span class="t">relationship task, drive your kids to school, whatever, cortisol needs to be released, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.400</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a very different mental framework around cortisol than we're used to hearing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">We normally hear, elevated cortisol, I'm releasing cortisol, my cortisol is too high.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You need cortisol released in order to get glucose, blood sugar into the bloodstream.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, cortisol is unique compared to, say, adrenaline or norepinephrine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.900</a></span> | <span class="t">because cortisol is what's called lipophilic, meaning because cell membranes are lipid, fat, and cortisol is lipophilic, it can move through cell membranes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And what that means in the functional context, what it means for you, is that cortisol is released from the adrenals, circulates in the blood, just like adrenaline would.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But unlike adrenaline, it can cross the blood-brain barrier, and it really likes to do that, because there are a lot of receptors for cortisol in the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">In particular, in a region of the brain called the hippocampus, which is involved in memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, we'll come back to the hippocampus later, because the hippocampus is vital for understanding what happens during situations of chronic stress,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and why cortisol can be dysregulated under conditions of chronic stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But for the time being, let's go back to thinking about cortisol simply as a mode of releasing glucose into the bloodstream.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=362" target="_blank">00:06:02.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Cortisol releases glucose into the bloodstream, much of that glucose is going to be directed toward brain energy, so that neurons, nerve cells can use it to think and to deal with whatever happens to be confronting you during your day, good or bad, stressful or non-stressful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of my biggest wishes for today is that you, and hopefully the rest of the world, will eventually come to adopt the understanding that cortisol is not a stress hormone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, cortisol is involved in stress, but cortisol's main job is to deploy energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an energy-producing hormone, in particular, a brain-energy-producing hormone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=398" target="_blank">00:06:38.300</a></span>

my nutrition using Carbon with the goals of increasing my muscle mass, increasing my strength, while also decreasing my body fat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=444" target="_blank">00:07:24.420</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been raving about the Carbon app to friends and to family and to members of my Huberman Lab team over the last few years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And everyone who's joined me in using it has found it to be tremendously useful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.620</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, some of those people are going to join me in my approaching 50 fitness goals and body composition goals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">My birthday is September 26th, and so I'd like to invite you to join if you would like to improve your body composition and fitness to also use the Carbon app.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, there are a lot of apps out there that are focused on fitness and nutrition, but what makes Carbon different is that it doesn't just hand you a one-size-fits-all plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=475" target="_blank">00:07:55.900</a></span> | <span class="t">It actually learns your metabolism over time, and it adapts your program based on your results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It also allows you total flexibility in how you eat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're plant-based or you're keto, high-carb, low-carb, anything in between, or even if you switch back and forth between different diets, Carbon works around your preferences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.420</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing I love about Carbon is that it easily adapts to whether you're the type of person who likes to put in the specific brand and the exact number of ounces or grams of food that you ate, or if you tend to be a little bit looser about that, like you ate half a handful of almonds or something like that, it can learn and adapt to that and still give you accurate recommendations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're looking to take a smarter, more personalized approach to your nutrition, I can't recommend the Carbon app enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.540</a></span> | <span

therapy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, it provides the opportunity to have a really good rapport with somebody that you can really trust and talk to about essentially any issue that you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Second of all, it can provide support in the form of emotional support or directed guidance, or, of course, both.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And third, expert therapy should provide you useful insights, insights that can help you improve in your work life, your relationships, and in your relationship with yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.980</a></span> | <span class="t">With BetterHelp, they make it very easy for you to find

<span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So just a couple of minutes ago, we were talking about how cortisol needs to be high in the morning, shortly after waking, and low in the nighttime, and certainly while you're asleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Except for, as it turns out, in the final hours of sleep, you actually want your cortisol rising.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So we need to take a step back and ask, why is cortisol released?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=633" target="_blank">00:10:33.340</a></span> | <span class="t">When is it released?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">How is it released?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Because understanding that gives us control over cortisol at any time of day or night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So rather than just list off a bunch of things that you can do to increase your cortisol or decrease your cortisol, which I'd love to do, frankly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.020</a></span> | <span class="t">but the problem with that is if I do that, it doesn't take into account that your levels of cortisol are constantly changing across the 24-hour cycle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you don't understand that endogenous 24-hour rhythm in cortisol, not just knowing that it's high in the morning and lower at night,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">if you don't understand how that's regulated, you won't know which protocols, which tools to apply when.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=669" target="_blank">00:11:09.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you can understand how that rhythm is generated, and how cortisol is released in response to short-term events, like stress,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but also the desire or need to exercise, the desire or need to focus, if you can understand those things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">how cortisol is released in the short-term and across the 24-hour cycle, how it literally regulates itself,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.940</a></span> | <span class="t">then you will have immense control over cortisol across the 24-hour cycle, from day to day, and from moment to moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, cortisol is a corticosteroid hormone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, it's a steroid hormone, just like testosterone is a steroid hormone, just like estrogen is a steroid hormone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Steroid hormones are derived from the molecule cholesterol,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.820</a></span> | <span class="t">and there are a bunch of biochemical steps that take you from cholesterol to cortisol,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or from cholesterol to testosterone, or from cholesterol to estrogen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Scientists have long known that cortisol is not at the same level throughout the 24-hour day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, there's a quite classic study now that examined the 24-hour pattern of the episodic secretion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">of cortisol in normal subjects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And what they found is that there are essentially four phases of cortisol levels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll just read off what these different phases are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Phase one is a six-hour period of what they call the minimal secretory activity, meaning when cortisol is not released very much,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that starts four hours before you turn your lights out to go to sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">The second phase of cortisol, in which the levels are quite different than in the first phase, is a three-hour period, which they called the preliminary nocturnal secretory episode, but we can simply call the third to fifth hour of sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=775" target="_blank">00:12:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So in your third to fifth hour of sleep, you have a second phase, and this phase they call the preliminary nocturnal secretory episode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is when cortisol is slightly starting to rise, just a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So ideally, you want cortisol very low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=795" target="_blank">00:13:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is under normal, healthy conditions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=797" target="_blank">00:13:17.560</a></span> | <span class="t">In that first phase, the four hours before until the two hours after lights out, cortisol is going to be very low, and it's going to stay low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And then in the second phase, it's going to slightly rise into the third and fifth hour of sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=810" target="_blank">00:13:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Then in phase three, which here is listed as a four-hour period, but the exact duration is going to vary, you have what's called the main secretory phase of cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is when cortisol is increasing very, very fast, and this occurs, believe it or not, during the sixth, seventh, and eighth hour of sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, you might say, I only sleep six hours, so do I get that fast rise in cortisol?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=833" target="_blank">00:13:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But you don't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.640</a></span> | <span class="t">If you sleep seven hours, you only get a portion of that fast rise in cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.300</a></span> | <span class="t">If you sleep eight hours, you get the full duration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you sleep nine hours, yes, your cortisol will continue to rise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So the idea here is that in the very final hours of sleep, your cortisol is starting to rise quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=852" target="_blank">00:14:12.620</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the time of sleep that correlates with when REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep is most abundant, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the early part of your sleep night, slow wave deep sleep is most abundant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.480</a></span> | <span class="t">This is when growth hormone is released.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">This is when your metabolism tends to be very low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Think about it, metabolism low means low requirement for blood glucose,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and it's associated with low cortisol levels, starting to make sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.820</a></span> | <span class="t">In the last portion of sleep, the final, say two to three,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=880" target="_blank">00:14:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">or if you sleep nine hours, four hours of sleep,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.780</a></span> | <span class="t">you have rising levels in cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">We know that's associated with REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep.</span></div><div

target="_blank">00:15:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm going to add another little sub phase to this, not to complicate it, but because it's a very powerful time each day, which is the first hour after waking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">From the

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a very special hour because it's a very special hour because it's a very special hour because it's a time in which you can further amplify the increase in cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.500</a></span> | <span class="t">After that first hour, or certainly after about 90 minutes, you don't have that opportunity again until the next morning.</span></div><div

to slow its decline into the afternoon and evening, but that first hour after waking is critical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=961" target="_blank">00:16:01.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=962"

target="_blank">00:16:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's talk about this in real-world terms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.240</a></span> | <span class="t">In the hours right before falling asleep and in the first hours of sleep, your cortisol is very low, ideally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.240</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the ideal case scenario for health, for your mental health, for your physical health, for performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Then cortisol starts to rise on its own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=979" target="_blank">00:16:19.460</a></span> | <span class="t">You're not doing anything to make it rise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">It starts to rise in particular, as you transition from the middle of the night toward the end of your sleep night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=986" target="_blank">00:16:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then just before waking, your cortisol is sharply rising, steep, steep slope of increase.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=991" target="_blank">00:16:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And then as you wake up, boom, you have this hour long or so opportunity to further increase your cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=998" target="_blank">00:16:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And you definitely want to increase your cortisol further during that first hour.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1002" target="_blank">00:16:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then about three, four hours later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1004" target="_blank">00:16:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So for most people, that would be late morning or around noontime, your cortisol levels are slowly going to start to decline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1011" target="_blank">00:16:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">However, if they decline too slowly, that's bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If they decline too sharply, that's also bad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So the picture I'm trying to draw for you here is you want a really sharp spike in cortisol as you arise in the morning, and then you want that to taper off somewhat gradually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So not too steeply, not too gradually into the afternoon, such that by three, four hours or so before sleep, your cortisol levels are low, low, low, low, low, and continuing to fall lower before they start up again the next morning in anticipation of you waking up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you haven't already caught on to this yet, you literally wake up because of a rise in cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's called the cortisol awakening response or CAR, C-A-R, cortisol awakening response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The importance of cortisol for waking up and for feeling alert early in the day cannot be overstated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the anchor point at which you have control over your cortisol levels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you do things right in that first hour or 90 minutes of the day, you're going to set yourself up for an overall healthy pattern of cortisol release at night as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so stay with me here as we get into a bit of mechanism as to how this cortisol rhythm is generated, because if you can understand that it gives you immense control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so let's talk about how cortisol is generated and how it self-regulates itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So cortisol again is made and released from the adrenals to be specific from a particular middle layer of your adrenals where a particular category of cells that make cortisol reside.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Those cells need the instruction to make and release cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1100" target="_blank">00:18:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And that instruction comes in the form of a hormone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So the whole story starts up in the brain in an area of the so-called hypothalamus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Hypothalamus is a little structure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's actually quite small, but the size of about two small marbles sitting above the roof of your mouth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1115" target="_blank">00:18:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And they sit next to this thing that we call a ventricle, which is where the cerebrospinal fluid circulates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1121" target="_blank">00:18:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now this turns out to be important because the cerebrospinal fluid gives the brain or the neurons there information about the chemistry of the body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It gives the neurons there information about what's in the bloodstream too, because the area there allows blood vessels to get closer to the neurons and expose the neurons to more of what's going on in terms of the body chemistry than neurons located more deeply in the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1144" target="_blank">00:19:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's nice that the neurons that we're going to talk about now reside in an area of the hypothalamus called the paraventricular nucleus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Para means near, ventricular means ventricle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1155" target="_blank">00:19:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So paraventricular, near the ventricle, where they can access information about the body's chemistry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1160" target="_blank">00:19:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are neurons that reside in the so-called PVN, paraventricular nucleus, and they extend processes into the pituitary gland.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The pituitary gland is a little stalk that has a couple of different lobes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">They literally look like little lobes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1175" target="_blank">00:19:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It looks like if you took a couple cloves of garlic and you held onto their stalks next to one another.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Those two cloves of garlic, a big stalk and a slightly smaller stalk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's kind of what the pituitary looks like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1185" target="_blank">00:19:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And the pituitary actually extends out of the brain and the neurons in the paraventricular nucleus release a hormone called corticotropin releasing hormone or CRH.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1195" target="_blank">00:19:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Corticotropin releasing hormone acts on neurons in the anterior pituitary and that front piece of garlic and causes the cells there to release a hormone called ACTH, adrenocorticotropin hormone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1208" target="_blank">00:20:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I know there's a lot of nomenclature here, but you should know the facts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1213" target="_blank">00:20:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">ACTH is then released into the bloodstream and it travels down to the adrenals and it stimulates the release of cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1221" target="_blank">00:20:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, by binding to something called the melanocortin receptor, which doesn't seem important for the moment, but later when I tell you why people who have chronically elevated cortisol get what's called hyperpigmentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1231" target="_blank">00:20:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">They get some pigmentation on their face that's kind of blotchy, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1235" target="_blank">00:20:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a symptom of something called Cushing syndrome, which is elevated cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It will make sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Melanocortin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1241" target="_blank">00:20:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1242" target="_blank">00:20:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's involved in pigmentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1243" target="_blank">00:20:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The melanocortin receptor sits in that middle layer of the adrenals and ACTH binds to it causing the synthesis and release of cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1254" target="_blank">00:20:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Then cortisol in response to stress, yes, but also in response to anytime we need to get our energy going, our brain energy, our focus, or as you learned a few moments ago, anytime we need to wake up in the morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1265" target="_blank">00:21:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1266" target="_blank">00:21:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Anytime we need to get out of bed that requires energy, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1268" target="_blank">00:21:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, the transition from sleep to wakefulness is one of the biggest requirements for an energy surge, which is why you have the cortisol awakening response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So cortisol is going to be released into the bloodstream.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1281" target="_blank">00:21:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to cause the deployment of blood glucose, the breakdown of amino acids and other fuels in muscle, in liver, in particular glycogen in the liver, that's going to be released into the bloodstream.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1292" target="_blank">00:21:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's the thing, as cortisol is released into the bloodstream, the neurons in the brain that caused the release of CRH, corticotropin releasing hormone, have access to how much cortisol is in the bloodstream.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1307" target="_blank">00:21:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">How?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1308" target="_blank">00:21:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, they are paraventricular blood vessels and capillaries are also lining the ventricles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1314" target="_blank">00:21:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So those cells in the paraventricular nucleus have a sort of thermometer, if you will.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1319" target="_blank">00:21:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">They're kind of like a thermostat paying attention to just how high levels of cortisol are in the bloodstream.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1325" target="_blank">00:22:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So when levels of cortisol in the bloodstream are very low, those cells in the paraventricular nucleus release more CRH to stimulate the release of ACTH, to go to the adrenals, to cause the stimulation and release of more cortisol, driving levels of cortisol up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1341" target="_blank">00:22:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, cortisol has a relatively long half-life, so it tends to accumulate in the bloodstream.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1346" target="_blank">00:22:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So as levels of cortisol tend to go up, let's think about that last phase of sleep, maybe, you know, two or three hours before you wake up, cortisol is going up, up, up, up, up, up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1355" target="_blank">00:22:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">What ends up happening eventually is that the cells in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus that release CRH hit a point where they realize, at a biochemical level that is, they realize based on receptor saturation and some other mechanisms internal to this cell,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">ah, cortisol levels are really, really high right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1375" target="_blank">00:22:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's shut down the release of corticotropin releasing hormone, which causes a shutdown of the release of ACTH, which causes a shutdown of the synthesis and release of cortisol from the adrenals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1388" target="_blank">00:23:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is what we call a negative feedback loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1391" target="_blank">00:23:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, this is the same way that testosterone works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In many ways, it's the same way that estrogen works, although estrogen subject to a bit more regulation as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1399" target="_blank">00:23:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">When levels of the hormone cortisol reach a certain point, a certain threshold, it shuts down its own production by turning off the signals that would cause more of it to be produced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1409" target="_blank">00:23:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so this is a negative feedback loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that means that cortisol, after reaching a certain high level in the morning, will eventually start to drop off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And those levels will continue to drop off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1420" target="_blank">00:23:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And should we encounter a need for a lot of brain energy?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So it could be a really focused conversation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1427" target="_blank">00:23:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It could be an exam.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It could be, you're playing a bout of soccer or you're going to the gym and you need a bunch of energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1434" target="_blank">00:23:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to rally your mind and your motivation to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1437" target="_blank">00:23:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, you'll get an increase in cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1439" target="_blank">00:23:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But that little increase in cortisol is like a bump of cortisol that rides on that already dropping endogenous rhythm in cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1448" target="_blank">00:24:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So by now it's probably dawning on you that as those levels of cortisol get lower and lower into the late afternoon and evening, et cetera,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1455" target="_blank">00:24:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">those cells in the brain that release CRH are now registering at a biochemical level, at a cellular level, that the levels of cortisol are very low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1464" target="_blank">00:24:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so eventually those levels get low enough that those cells in the pair of ventricular nucleus go, oh, cortisol levels are really, really low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1472" target="_blank">00:24:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">They're not zero, but they're really low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1474" target="_blank">00:24:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's start releasing corticotropin releasing hormone, which stimulates ACTH, which stimulates the adrenals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1479" target="_blank">00:24:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's why cortisol starts to rise again late in sleep and into the next morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1485" target="_blank">00:24:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Does it make sense?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1486" target="_blank">00:24:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Hopefully that makes sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1487" target="_blank">00:24:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Cortisol is regulating its own production so that it doesn't get too high or too low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1491" target="_blank">00:24:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it does that through a negative feedback loop involving these cells in the hypothalamus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1495" target="_blank">00:24:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I just described was something called the HPA axis, hypothalamic H pituitary P adrenal axis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1504" target="_blank">00:25:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so the HPA axis is important for synthesis of cortisol to generate this 24-hour so-called circadian rhythm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1512" target="_blank">00:25:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's also important for the synthesis of cortisol in response to stress, both short-term and long-term.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1518" target="_blank">00:25:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm going to get back to stress a little bit more later, but let's just for a moment think about that HPA axis and two things about stress that you can kind of put up on the shelf that will be helpful later as we get into our discussion about short-term and chronic stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Stress activates the HPA axis, but as you know, stress is a very fast response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1539" target="_blank">00:25:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Meaning when you encounter a stressor, your heart rate goes up, your blood pressure goes up, your eyes widen, literally your pupils widen and your eyes widen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1547" target="_blank">00:25:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And all sorts of things happen in terms of your levels of alertness and attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1551" target="_blank">00:25:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That very rapid response occurs also because of the HPA axis, but because of the release of adrenaline, epinephrine and norepinephrine from your adrenals and also from areas in your brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1566" target="_blank">00:26:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If not milliseconds, certainly within seconds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Just think about if you're walking down the street in a city and a, you know, a car kind of veers onto the sidewalk and you have to jump out of the way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1575" target="_blank">00:26:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You made the reaction without even basically having to think about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1579" target="_blank">00:26:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You get out of the way and your heart rates up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1581" target="_blank">00:26:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything's happening all at once.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You're completely different state than you were just a few seconds prior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1585" target="_blank">00:26:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Even that's all happening fast because of adrenaline and norepinephrine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1590" target="_blank">00:26:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Cortisol, yes, will be deployed in response to that sort of stressor, but cortisol needs to be synthesized and then released and then it causes the release of glucose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's going to take some time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1603" target="_blank">00:26:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, it takes about 10 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1605" target="_blank">00:26:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So it turns out that can explain a lot of why stress tends to come on very quickly and last rather long relative to the stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1614" target="_blank">00:26:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">To the thing like the car that veered up onto the sidewalk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You probably had that experience where something happens.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1623" target="_blank">00:27:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Then the stressor is resolved, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1625" target="_blank">00:27:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The car didn't hit you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1635" target="_blank">00:27:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1636" target="_blank">00:27:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That was a close call.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1637" target="_blank">00:27:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And guess what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1638" target="_blank">00:27:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">About five, 10 minutes later, you're still kind of stressed about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1641" target="_blank">00:27:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Something stressful happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1643" target="_blank">00:27:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Something real as we say happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1646" target="_blank">00:27:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's hard to just kind of get back to baseline again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1649" target="_blank">00:27:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's because that wave of cortisol comes on a little bit later and it lasts longer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1653" target="_blank">00:27:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It has a much longer half-life than does adrenaline or norepinephrine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1658" target="_blank">00:27:38.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So the stress response has this fast aspect to it that's generated through the HPA axis and through, again, release of hormones such as norepinephrine in the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1668" target="_blank">00:27:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Those two things happen in parallel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1669" target="_blank">00:27:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">By the way, that happens because adrenaline is released from the adrenals very quickly to cause changes in the body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1674" target="_blank">00:27:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But adrenaline can't cross the blood brain barrier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1677" target="_blank">00:27:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you need a very fast reaction in order to deal with a stressor, you can't really wait for that hormone to cross from the bloodstream into the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1684" target="_blank">00:28:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So you release norepinephrine from a site in the brain very quickly as well in parallel with that release of adrenaline.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1690" target="_blank">00:28:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So those two things happen in parallel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1691" target="_blank">00:28:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Boom, you deal with the stressor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1692" target="_blank">00:28:12.660</a></span> |

target="_blank">00:28:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But then that wave of synthesis and release of cortisol occurs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1702" target="_blank">00:28:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Blood glucose is elevated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1703" target="_blank">00:28:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it takes a while for stress to come down again.</span></div><div

pituitary adrenal axis, as is the generation of that 24 hour rhythm in cortisol where cortisol slowly rises and then goes back down into the evening and nighttime and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1721" target="_blank">00:28:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1730" target="_blank">00:28:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it involves a structure called the suprachiasmatic nucleus or SCN.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1735" target="_blank">00:28:55.660</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:28:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the set of neurons also above the roof of your mouth, also in the hypothalamus, that basically orchestrates all the activities of all the organs and cells in your body like an orchestra conductor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1750"

others.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1755" target="_blank">00:29:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Regulates pretty much everything, including cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1758" target="_blank">00:29:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And the SCN can control the HPA axis when it's active, when it's less active.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1764" target="_blank">00:29:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's less active by virtue of connections that run through, if you really want to know the names for you aficionados, through the dorsomedial hypothalamus and then to the paraventricular nucleus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1772" target="_blank">00:29:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1773" target="_blank">00:29:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That's all fine and good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1774" target="_blank">00:29:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It just means that the HPA axis is subject to immediate control over stressors or other things that require our attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1781" target="_blank">00:29:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, doesn't have to be stressed, could be positive things as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1784" target="_blank">00:29:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The HPA axis is under the control of the SCN circadian timing, which is what generates that high in the morning, low in the afternoon and evening rhythm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1794" target="_blank">00:29:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">All of that subject to negative feedback controls itself, making sure levels don't get too high or too low for too long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1801" target="_blank">00:30:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's a second pathway, a parallel pathway, as we call it, that is separate from the HPA control over the synthesis and release of cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1809" target="_blank">00:30:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And this one originates also in the SCN, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and is relayed through a couple of different synapses, a couple of different junctions, and eventually runs through a nerve pathway that, for you aficionados, is called the splanschnic nerve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1823" target="_blank">00:30:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Kind of cool name, splanschnic nerve, that can cause the release of cortisol, or I should say the synthesis and release of cortisol, in response to times when you want cortisol to be especially high for a while.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1837" target="_blank">00:30:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so this is different than the requirement for stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1840" target="_blank">00:30:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You might think, you know, we want cortisol to be high in response to stressors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1844" target="_blank">00:30:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">No, your brain and body are really smart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1847" target="_blank">00:30:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">They're really, really smart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1848" target="_blank">00:30:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">When you encounter a stressor, you deploy just as much cortisol as your body thinks you might need in order to resolve that stressor, and probably not a whole lot more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1857" target="_blank">00:30:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And because cortisol lasts a while, as we just discussed, it gives you an opportunity to have more brain energy, bodily energy to resolve that stressor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But your brain and body sort of know, at a biological level, that you don't want cortisol too high for too long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1870" target="_blank">00:31:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That's why you have the negative feedback loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1872" target="_blank">00:31:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">However, there's a beautiful mechanism, which is the second parallel pathway from the SCN that allows you to control the amount of cortisol that you release and boost it even further for a long period of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1887" target="_blank">00:31:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, when would you want that to occur?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1888" target="_blank">00:31:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You think like, why would I want that to occur?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1890" target="_blank">00:31:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe in response to a chronic stressor, a very long stressor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1893" target="_blank">00:31:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, actually, you wouldn't want that to happen because if cortisol is elevated for too long at the wrong times of day or night, you run into all sorts of issues related to immune system suppression, to dysregulation of metabolic function.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1906" target="_blank">00:31:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is where we start to hear about some of the more common negative aspects of chronically elevated cortisol, like accumulation of body fat around the midsection, the so-called moon face.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1915" target="_blank">00:31:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, literally the rounding of the face and the acute accumulation of fat in the face.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1921" target="_blank">00:32:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There's usually an accompanying loss of fat in the neck and accumulation of fat around the belly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1926" target="_blank">00:32:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Nobody wants this, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1927" target="_blank">00:32:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Some things like hyperpigmentation and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1929" target="_blank">00:32:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1930" target="_blank">00:32:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But there is a time of day when everyone would benefit from having higher levels of cortisol, not just for a few moments or minutes, but for several hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1941" target="_blank">00:32:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the first hour or two or two and a half or three after waking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1947" target="_blank">00:32:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So while there's this 24 hour rhythm in cortisol where cortisol is elevated in the morning, there's this unique opportunity of about an hour to two hours, maybe three immediately after waking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1959" target="_blank">00:32:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">When your SCN can activate this parallel pathway down to your adrenals to cause the release of more cortisol and elevate your morning energy, alertness, mood, and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1970" target="_blank">00:32:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now you might be saying, wait, this is kind of confusing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1973" target="_blank">00:32:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The SCN controls the 24 hour rhythm, but it's also controlling the faster release of cortisol during this, you know, kind of one unique window immediately after waking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1981" target="_blank">00:33:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's kind of confusing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1982" target="_blank">00:33:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The SCN is involved in both things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1984" target="_blank">00:33:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Ah, well, the SCN has access to one particular feature of your external world of your environment that no other structure in the hypothalamus has access to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1993" target="_blank">00:33:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the presence or absence of light.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=1996" target="_blank">00:33:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The retina, the light sensing tissue at the back of your eye contains a bunch of different neurons that sense light converted into electrical signals and hand those electrical signals off to a certain class of cells called the retinal ganglion cells.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2009" target="_blank">00:33:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Retinal ganglion cells project into the brain to allow you to see things, color, shapes, motion, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2014" target="_blank">00:33:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">However, there's a specialized subset of those retinal ganglion cells called the intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin retinal ganglion cells that respond in particular to very bright light or more accurately to transitions between dimmer environments and brighter environments that last a long period of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2034" target="_blank">00:33:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Like for instance, when you go from your eyes closed in sleep to your eyes opening when awake, those neurons project directly to the suprachiasmatic nucleus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2046" target="_blank">00:34:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, your SCN has unique access to information about when the levels of overall luminance in your environment change dramatically, such as upon waking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2056" target="_blank">00:34:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's where I'm going to suggest a protocol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2058" target="_blank">00:34:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And you've heard this protocol before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2060" target="_blank">00:34:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I know the protocol is to get bright light, ideally from sunlight into your eyes within the first hour of waking, ideally within the first 30 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2069" target="_blank">00:34:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Ideally it's from sunlight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2071" target="_blank">00:34:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So you would go outside, take your sunglasses off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2074" target="_blank">00:34:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Eyeglasses and contacts are fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2076" target="_blank">00:34:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Even if they have UV protection in them, look in the direction of the sun blink as needed to protect your eyes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2081" target="_blank">00:34:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, you can do this on cloudy days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2083" target="_blank">00:34:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, it's more important to do on cloudy days because cloudy days tend to be dimmer overall.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2088" target="_blank">00:34:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is a unique opportunity to boost your cortisol levels in that first hour of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2094" target="_blank">00:34:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you don't have access to sunlight for whatever reason, travel, you live in a cave, time of year, weather, whatever, you could use a 10,000 lux artificial light.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2103" target="_blank">00:35:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">These are available online for usually about a hundred dollars or so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2107" target="_blank">00:35:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">These are very useful tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2108" target="_blank">00:35:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of them are portable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2109" target="_blank">00:35:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're going to do that, I still highly recommend that you get outside and get some sunlight in your eyes as soon as you can, once the sun is out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2116" target="_blank">00:35:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But for you very early risers that wake up before the sun is out, this is so, so key.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2121" target="_blank">00:35:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And I know I've been talking about this for years on this podcast and elsewhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2124" target="_blank">00:35:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And I know I've just been, you know, hitting this like, like a, you know, banging on the same drum over and over again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2130" target="_blank">00:35:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But that additional surge in cortisol that can occur only in that first one to say two or three hours of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2137" target="_blank">00:35:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a very special time because it's not just about the elevated mood focus and alertness that you're going to achieve during that time by virtue of getting bright light in your eyes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2146" target="_blank">00:35:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's also the case and please hear this.</span></div><div class="c"><span

cortisol is early in the day, the better you're setting yourself up for low levels of cortisol later in the evening and at night, which will allow you to fall asleep easily, to stay asleep easily.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2169" target="_blank">00:36:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And now you know why.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2172" target="_blank">00:36:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The reason why is that negative feedback regulation of cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2177" target="_blank">00:36:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Think about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2178" target="_blank">00:36:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If cortisol gets too high, the system shuts down the release of more cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2183" target="_blank">00:36:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And what you've done by viewing bright light as soon as possible after waking is to amplify your levels of cortisol, which then are going to trigger that negative feedback loop and going to cause cortisol to gradually decline from the late morning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2199" target="_blank">00:36:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">perhaps starting around 10:00 AM, 11:00 noon, depending on when you woke up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2204" target="_blank">00:36:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

of protein and 75% of its calories come from protein.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2328" target="_blank">00:38:48.660</a></span> |

<span class="t">In fact, the toughest challenge is knowing which ones to eat on which days and how many times per day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2349" target="_blank">00:39:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I limit myself to two per day, but I absolutely love them.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2362" target="_blank">00:39:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it allows me to do so without ingesting too many calories.</span></div><div

class="t">Again, that's davidprotein.com/huberman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2387" target="_blank">00:39:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now we're going to talk about some other things that you can do to boost your morning cortisol in a meaningful way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2392" target="_blank">00:39:52.660</a></span> | <span class="t">However, before I do that, I have to say that this viewing morning sunlight thing or bright light from a 10,000 lux artificial source, the increase in cortisol that it provides, and therefore the increase in energy and mood and focus, et cetera, is very significant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2410" target="_blank">00:40:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's been shown to quickly increase cortisol levels by up to 50%, five, zero percent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2416" target="_blank">00:40:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And in fact, it's clinically significant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2419" target="_blank">00:40:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">People who live in areas of the world where during winter there's very little availability of sunlight and just rely on artificial indoor lights often suffer from what's called seasonal affective disorder.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2429" target="_blank">00:40:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The protocol I just described is exactly the same protocol that they have used successfully to offset seasonal depression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2437" target="_blank">00:40:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I realize that most of you listening to this don't live in areas of the world too close to the poles.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2442" target="_blank">00:40:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So no doubt you get more sunlight available to you during the winter than you do if you were to say live in Scandinavia or down at the South Pole.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2449" target="_blank">00:40:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">However, these days, most people are not taking advantage of those early hours of the day to get outside and get bright light from sunlight or from a 10,000 lux artificial source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2460" target="_blank">00:41:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, most people just look at their phone or flip on a few indoor artificial lights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2464" target="_blank">00:41:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is not going to be sufficient to boost your cortisol levels the way you need to in order to achieve the kind of elevation and mood focus and alertness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2473" target="_blank">00:41:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And that can offset things like not just seasonal depression, but mild depression, malaise, lack of daytime energy, and on and on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2482" target="_blank">00:41:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So this thing about viewing bright light early in the morning, it's a real thing from the standpoint of the mechanism is understood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2489" target="_blank">00:41:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The ideal timing is understood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2491" target="_blank">00:41:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The magnitude of the impact on cortisol is very significant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2495" target="_blank">00:41:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">These are big effects and it's clinically significant with respect to mood, meaning you're going to feel more energized.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2501" target="_blank">00:41:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to feel better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2502" target="_blank">00:41:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2503" target="_blank">00:41:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So now that you understand that getting your cortisol high upon waking is the right thing to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2508" target="_blank">00:41:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">This is what you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2509" target="_blank">00:41:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's talk about some of the other things you can do besides viewing bright light in order to increase your morning cortisol, but keep in the back of your mind that viewing bright light is the foundation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2520" target="_blank">00:42:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2521" target="_blank">00:42:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So you wake up in the morning and as quickly as you can, you get bright light into your eyes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2524" target="_blank">00:42:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">What else should you do to boost your cortisol?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2526" target="_blank">00:42:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, there are a number of things that you can do and that you should do every single day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2529" target="_blank">00:42:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of them are pretty easy and many of them can be combined.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2533" target="_blank">00:42:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">One of those is hydration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2535" target="_blank">00:42:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now of all the protocols in the realm of mental health, physical health and performance, I think the most underrated one, believe it or not, is hydration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2542" target="_blank">00:42:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">When you look at the literature on hydration and the effects of even mild dehydration, what you find is that cognitive function, physical function, basically cellular function and organ function generally all suffer when you're even mildly dehydrated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2555" target="_blank">00:42:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's very important that you hydrate first thing in the morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2558" target="_blank">00:42:38.660</a></span> | <span class="t">For me, that's 16 to 32 ounces of water with some electrolytes in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2561" target="_blank">00:42:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">For you, it might just be water, whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2563" target="_blank">00:42:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The interesting thing is that one of the major effects of proper hydration is to increase levels of alertness and the way it does it is by acting on the adrenals, both epinephrine, adrenaline and cortisol release.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2576" target="_blank">00:42:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're not talking about big spikes in cortisol related to drinking water.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2579" target="_blank">00:42:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We're talking about modest increases in the levels of pulsatile as it's called release of cortisol due to hydration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2586" target="_blank">00:43:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So hydrating first thing in the morning, also a terrific idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2589" target="_blank">00:43:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You can do this while you get your bright light outside or while you get your bright light from a 10,000 lux artificial source.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2594" target="_blank">00:43:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Hydrate first thing in the morning, it's going to increase your levels of energy then and throughout the morning and into the afternoon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2601" target="_blank">00:43:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, highly underrated protocol in part because it takes a lot, a lot of dehydration before we realize that we're dehydrated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2609" target="_blank">00:43:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">When you wake up in the morning, you use the restroom, you're probably mildly dehydrated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2613" target="_blank">00:43:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Get yourself hydrated first thing in the morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2615" target="_blank">00:43:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Your cortisol levels will thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2617" target="_blank">00:43:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Your levels of energy will thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2619" target="_blank">00:43:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if you're like me, you also hydrate with caffeine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2622" target="_blank">00:43:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2623" target="_blank">00:43:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now the discussion around caffeine and cortisol can be a little bit confused by the sort of discrepancies in the literature as to yes, caffeine increases cortisol or some studies that show no caffeine doesn't increase cortisol, but it might extend the life of cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2637" target="_blank">00:43:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's the big picture on caffeine and cortisol, at least the meaningful one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2641" target="_blank">00:44:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're a chronic caffeine user, meaning you drink caffeine every day or you've consumed caffeine every day for the previous five days, which is the typical framework in one of these studies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2651" target="_blank">00:44:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you drink caffeine, a hundred milligrams, 200 milligrams, 300 milligrams, even an energy drink that includes caffeine and some other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2658" target="_blank">00:44:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The increase in cortisol that you're going to experience is probably not that significant unless it's a massively elevated dose of caffeine for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2666" target="_blank">00:44:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">However, if you're somebody who's not caffeine adapted, you're not drinking caffeine every day, you haven't had it for the last five days, then yes, you will experience a significant increase in cortisol levels.</span></div><div

user?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2679" target="_blank">00:44:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Are you an occasional caffeine user or do you not use caffeine?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2683" target="_blank">00:44:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're somebody who avoids caffeine because it makes you anxious or you just don't like it, then by all means, don't drink caffeine just to spike your cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2690" target="_blank">00:44:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It will be very effective in spiking your cortisol, but I can't really encourage you to drink caffeine if you don't want to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2696" target="_blank">00:44:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If, however, you're somebody who regularly drinks caffeine, you now know that it's not going to boost your cortisol levels that much, maybe a little bit, depending on how much you drink.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2706" target="_blank">00:45:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If it's a typical amount for you, meaning your caffeine adapted to that amount of caffeine, probably not much cortisol increase will come from drinking that amount.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2713" target="_blank">00:45:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">However, it will prolong the duration of cortisol's effectiveness in your bloodstream.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2719" target="_blank">00:45:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And this has to do with a number of different pathways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2721" target="_blank">00:45:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But the point being, if you have your caffeine say 30 minutes after waking or five minutes after waking or 90 minutes after waking, well, it's probably not going to boost your cortisol levels that much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2734" target="_blank">00:45:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're already viewing bright sunlight, you're hydrating, we'll talk about exercise and some other things in a moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2739" target="_blank">00:45:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're drinking that caffeine shortly after waking up or shortly close to when you get that big cortisol spike, it's going to make the down slope of that cortisol spike a bit more gradual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2751" target="_blank">00:45:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Or if you're drinking caffeine throughout the morning, a lot more gradual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2754" target="_blank">00:45:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me present two scenarios in which you can use caffeine to improve your levels of move, focus and alertness by way of the cortisol pathway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2762" target="_blank">00:46:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And here I'm only speaking to people who habitually use caffeine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2766" target="_blank">00:46:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're drinking caffeine every morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2768" target="_blank">00:46:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The first group is one that I commonly encounter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2770" target="_blank">00:46:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">These are people that say, I don't care what I hear out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2773" target="_blank">00:46:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I want my coffee or I want my yerba mate, which is my preferred source of caffeine first thing in the morning, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2778" target="_blank">00:46:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Ideally, even before water.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2779" target="_blank">00:46:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, there I'd say, please drink water first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2781" target="_blank">00:46:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But even if you're not going to sure, go ahead and drink your caffeine, drink that caffeine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2786" target="_blank">00:46:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not going to boost your cortisol that much, but make sure you're doing a bunch of other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2791" target="_blank">00:46:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Bright light viewing, talk about exercise in a moment, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2795" target="_blank">00:46:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Do a bunch of other things to make sure that morning cortisol spike is really, really high because that's what you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2801" target="_blank">00:46:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now there's a second group of people that say, hey, I want my caffeine first thing in the morning, or I'm drinking my caffeine first thing in the morning, but then I'm crashing really hard in the late morning, crashing really hard in the afternoon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2814" target="_blank">00:46:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not because I'm not sleeping well at night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2816" target="_blank">00:46:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like something's happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2817" target="_blank">00:46:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">This is where the recommendation that I've been making for some years now of delaying your caffeine by anywhere from 60 to 90 minutes comes about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2826" target="_blank">00:47:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You now know that caffeine for a habitual user is not going to increase your cortisol levels that much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2833" target="_blank">00:47:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">However, you also now know that drinking caffeine will extend the life of cortisol somewhat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2840" target="_blank">00:47:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So the logic here is if you drink your caffeine, not immediately after waking, but let's say an hour after waking or 90 minutes after waking, it's going to flatten out a bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2852" target="_blank">00:47:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The down slope of that cortisol as you transition from late morning into the early afternoon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2859" target="_blank">00:47:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of reason why people crash in the afternoon, they get that extreme fatigue typically after lunch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2865" target="_blank">00:47:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, it can be due to eating too much at lunch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2867" target="_blank">00:47:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, it can be due to eating too many starchy carbohydrates or sugars at lunch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2871" target="_blank">00:47:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It can be due to lack of sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2873" target="_blank">00:47:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But assuming that you're doing all the things right and you're still experiencing that crash in the afternoon,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2878" target="_blank">00:47:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">there's a good chance that it's because your morning cortisol peak, high enough or no, is coming down too fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2885" target="_blank">00:48:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And in order to make it more gradual, you simply shift your caffeine intake a little bit later</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2890" target="_blank">00:48:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">so that that diminishing caffeine level that it starts to occur around 10:00 AM, 11:00 AM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2895" target="_blank">00:48:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course, all of this relates to exactly when you wake up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2897" target="_blank">00:48:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But that dropping level in caffeine isn't a steep cliff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2901" target="_blank">00:48:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a little bit more gradual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2903" target="_blank">00:48:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And I can't tell you how many thousands of people have contacted me and said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2907" target="_blank">00:48:27.660</a></span> | <span

class="t">Simply by pushing out my caffeine intake by 60 minutes or even 30 minutes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2913" target="_blank">00:48:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">or in some cases, 90 minutes after waking,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

afternoon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2920" target="_blank">00:48:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And they generally thank me for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2922" target="_blank">00:48:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Indeed, most all of them are

target="_blank">00:48:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">you want your caffeine first thing in the morning and you just refuse to delay it, fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

cortisol pulse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=2940" target="_blank">00:49:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Caffeine is a great

and norepinephrine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3071" target="_blank">00:51:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And yes, you do get some increase in cortisol, in particular in the late stages, meaning late in the first hour of exercise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3079" target="_blank">00:51:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Typically my resistance training sessions don't span longer than 90 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3082" target="_blank">00:51:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That includes the warmup and the cool down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3084" target="_blank">00:51:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So after about 70 minutes of resistance training with real effort, close to failure or to failure, you know, this kind of thing, cortisol levels are way up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3094" target="_blank">00:51:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And they'll stay up for a short while, meaning an hour or so after exercise, and then they'll come back down, especially if you're doing things to deliberately bring them down, including eating a meal laden with carbohydrates, which will help bring those cortisol levels down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3107" target="_blank">00:51:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But if for instance, somebody who's never resistance trained or who's primarily an endurance athlete starts resistance training in that way, the literature points to the fact that they will experience much higher cortisol levels and those cortisol levels will be sustained over many more hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3125" target="_blank">00:52:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The same thing could be said for endurance exercise or for high intensity interval training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3129" target="_blank">00:52:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't want to complicate things too much by spelling out each of the different scenarios.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3133" target="_blank">00:52:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I will provide a link to it, what I consider a really nice paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3136" target="_blank">00:52:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just one of the several pointing to this, but the title of the paper is Endocrine Responses of the Stress System to Different Types of Exercise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3143" target="_blank">00:52:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And they looked at single bout endurance, regular endurance, single bout high intensity exercise, regular high intensity exercise, single bout resistance, regular resistance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3153" target="_blank">00:52:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So they went through not all, but many of the permutations that are possible and spell out what are the effects on cortisol, what are the effects on the catecholamines, norepinephrine and epinephrine in this case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3163" target="_blank">00:52:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">What are the effects on inflammatory cytokines?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3165" target="_blank">00:52:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We sometimes forget this, but inflammatory cytokines are a healthy byproduct of exercise because those trigger the adaptations in your immune system and other tissues to adapt, to get stronger, including your immune system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3179" target="_blank">00:52:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And they also looked at growth hormone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3181" target="_blank">00:53:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It was kind of interesting because where you find big increases in cortisol, you also see big increases in growth hormone in response to exercise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3189" target="_blank">00:53:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Meaning when the exercise is novel, either because it's a new form of exercise or because the intensity is novel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3195" target="_blank">00:53:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So we can take a step back and say with certainty exercise increases cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3201" target="_blank">00:53:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">However, if the form of exercise and the timing is very familiar to you, the amount of cortisol and in particular the duration of cortisol increase is not going to be that significant as compared to if it's a completely novel form or timing of exercise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3215" target="_blank">00:53:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now is the increase in cortisol that's achieved with your, let's call them your regular workouts, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3221" target="_blank">00:53:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Typically if you run or you lift weights or you do some sort of interval training, if you're doing any number or just one of those things, is the amount of cortisol increase that you experience going to be significant in terms of helping you anchor that cortisol cycle so that cortisol is higher in the morning and lower in the afternoon and evening?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3238" target="_blank">00:53:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The answer is yes. Exercise of a type that's familiar to you, of an intensity that's familiar to you may not significantly increase your cortisol levels as compared to a form of exercise that's completely novel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3251" target="_blank">00:54:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">However, exercise provides a very strong, what's called entrainment cue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3256" target="_blank">00:54:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Entrainment cues are cues of things that we do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3259" target="_blank">00:54:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">These could be meals.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3260" target="_blank">00:54:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It could be light exposure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3261" target="_blank">00:54:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It could be exercise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3262" target="_blank">00:54:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It could be all sorts of things, even social engagement that feed back onto the SCN, the supercalorie.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3267" target="_blank">00:54:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The SCN, the suprachiasmatic nucleus and reinforce the timing of the cortisol release that the SCN causes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3274" target="_blank">00:54:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are these beautiful interactions between exercise, the SCN and cortisol release that when we exercise at roughly the same period of time each day, doesn't have to be right on the minute, but within the same two or three hour window each day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3287" target="_blank">00:54:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And since like most people, you're probably not exercising every single day, perhaps three days a week, four days a week, ideally five or six days a week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3294" target="_blank">00:54:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">When you do that, pretty soon you get a cortisol increase simply in response to the timing rolling around in a very Pavlovian way, even if you don't exercise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3304" target="_blank">00:55:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now you have to keep exercising to maintain that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3307" target="_blank">00:55:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But the key here is that when you exercise in the same two to three hour window each day, or at least three days a week, ideally four, five, six days per week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3316" target="_blank">00:55:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I do think it's important to have at least one complete rest day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3319" target="_blank">00:55:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">When you do that, that big peak in cortisol that's endogenously generated by your SCN, that's just internally generated without doing anything else, it gets anchored to that stage of the day in a very solid way as compared to people who don't exercise early in the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3337" target="_blank">00:55:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So the point here is that you exercise sure to increase your cortisol, but probably for a bunch of other reasons more than you do to increase your cortisol, but getting your cortisol rhythm correct is absolutely essential.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3350" target="_blank">00:55:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, it's going to give you the anticipatory energy for exercise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3354" target="_blank">00:55:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, you can try this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3355" target="_blank">00:55:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's remarkable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3356" target="_blank">00:55:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you exercise at the same time of day for say four to five, maybe six days per week, you just do that for a week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3363" target="_blank">00:56:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it doesn't have to be again, exactly at the same time you start exactly the same time you stop plus or minus 30 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3369" target="_blank">00:56:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">What you'll find is that in the hour leading into that exercise, you will start to experience an increase in energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3377" target="_blank">00:56:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's not just psychological.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3379" target="_blank">00:56:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There's an anticipatory rise in cortisol that's governed by the SCN and this process that we call entrainment, which is anticipation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3385" target="_blank">00:56:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's kind of like a Pavlovian response, but it's on a longer timescale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3389" target="_blank">00:56:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, regardless of timescale, it's a very real thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3392" target="_blank">00:56:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're somebody who doesn't seem to have much energy, much get up and go in the morning and you're getting your bright light, you're getting your hydration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3399" target="_blank">00:56:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you're even drinking caffeine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3400" target="_blank">00:56:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You're doing all of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3401" target="_blank">00:56:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're still feeling kind of sluggish exercising for three or four days, not necessarily in a row.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3407" target="_blank">00:56:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Feel free to introduce a rest day as needed, but doing that across the course of a week for four to six days will lead you into a second week, a third week, et cetera, provided you keep it up where you're going to have more energy heading into the exercise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3421" target="_blank">00:57:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Therefore, more energy to exercise.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3423" target="_blank">00:57:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's just going to be a positive feedback loop on your cortisol levels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3427" target="_blank">00:57:07.660</a></span> | <span

class="t">And in fact, it's so robust that you can observe it in mice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3431" target="_blank">00:57:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You can observe it in dogs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3433"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3436" target="_blank">00:57:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It has internal endogenous cues that, you know, between the hours of whatever seven and 9:00 AM, it's time for a walk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3442" target="_blank">00:57:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it will start to experience a surge in energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3444" target="_blank">00:57:24.660</a></span> | <span

somewhat controversial in other domains like metabolism, deliberate cold exposure definitely wakes you up and it wakes you up very fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3488" target="_blank">00:58:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it does that because it causes the release of epinephrine and

long arc of dopamine release.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3495" target="_blank">00:58:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">This is one of the major reasons, if not the major reason why people who start deliberate cold exposure continue to do it, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

cause the release of cortisol?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3538" target="_blank">00:58:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And just like with exercise, just like with caffeine, the real question that we have to ask ourselves is how novel, how unfamiliar is that deliberate cold exposure?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3548" target="_blank">00:59:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Because while the perfect experiment has never really been done, if you amass the literature on this, what you find is that if you put people into very cold water or even just cold for them, uncomfortably cold for them water, yes, they'll increase more cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3565" target="_blank">00:59:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, they'll release cortisol into their bloodstream.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3568" target="_blank">00:59:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">However, if they do this habitually, then the increases in cortisol are not meaningful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3573" target="_blank">00:59:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">They're not statistically significant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3575" target="_blank">00:59:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So that actually leads to two important takeaways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3578" target="_blank">00:59:38.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The first one is, if you want to use deliberate cold exposure as a way to increase cortisol, great, do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3584" target="_blank">00:59:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But probably don't do it more than say one or two times per week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3587" target="_blank">00:59:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Otherwise it will lose its effectiveness for that purpose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3590" target="_blank">00:59:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It will still be very effective for all the other reasons that deliberate cold exposure has been purported to be effective, including increased release of catecholamines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3598" target="_blank">00:59:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So the takeaway here is very straightforward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3600" target="_blank">01:00:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you want to boost your cortisol levels using deliberate cold exposure, cold shower, ice plunge, whatever it is, you can do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3607" target="_blank">01:00:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But it needs to be occasional deliberate cold exposure, probably not more than twice per week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3612" target="_blank">01:00:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Otherwise, you're not going to get a significant increase in cortisol as a consequence of that deliberate cold exposure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3618" target="_blank">01:00:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">However, if you're somebody who likes doing deliberate cold exposure, keep in mind that it's not going to chronically elevate your cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3626" target="_blank">01:00:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">This is advantageous for a number of reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3628" target="_blank">01:00:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, it will, yes, continue to elevate your levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine for increased mood and energy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3637" target="_blank">01:00:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That effect persists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3638" target="_blank">01:00:38.660</a></span> | <span class="t">As far as we know, that effect never saturates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3641" target="_blank">01:00:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're somebody who's concerned about elevating your cortisol too much, you're concerned about chronic elevation of cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3648" target="_blank">01:00:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And I hear a lot about this in the circles around, you know, important differences between men's fitness and health and women's fitness and health, and maybe that deliberate cold exposure is good for men and not for women.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3659" target="_blank">01:00:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There's really no evidence to support that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3660" target="_blank">01:01:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, the evidence points in exactly the opposite direction, which is that when people, men or women, do deliberate cold exposure regularly more than twice per week, then the impact on cortisol is not significant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3672" target="_blank">01:01:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And yet they still can benefit by getting those increases in dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3677" target="_blank">01:01:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors,

the other things that you can do to increase your morning cortisol levels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3774" target="_blank">01:02:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're starting to get the picture that cortisol is something that you want high early in the day and that you want tapering off later into the day, great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3781" target="_blank">01:03:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you're getting the picture correctly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3783" target="_blank">01:03:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, one way to think about it is that cortisol is kind of like a wave that starts on its own, but for which you can increase the height of that wave and catch that wave early in the day and into the afternoon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3794" target="_blank">01:03:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you imagine it that way, then you're probably saying, what other things can I do besides viewing light, besides hydration, besides caffeine, besides exercise?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3804" target="_blank">01:03:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And probably part of the reason you're asking is that not all of us are able to do all of those things every single day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3810" target="_blank">01:03:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I do acknowledge that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3811" target="_blank">01:03:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So the larger the toolkit of things that you can use to increase your morning cortisol peak, the more flexibility you have when trying to come up with those, when traveling, when especially busy, and so on and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3822" target="_blank">01:03:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we take a step back and ask ourselves, what sorts of chemical compounds out there can help us increase our cortisol levels?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3828" target="_blank">01:03:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We come up with some pretty interesting answers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3830" target="_blank">01:03:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And no, we're not going to talk about supplements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3833" target="_blank">01:03:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It is true that certain supplements like Yohimbine, like L-tyrosine, can have a modest effect in increasing cortisol, but we're not going to emphasize those.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3842" target="_blank">01:04:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We're actually going to emphasize two naturally occurring foods that have a significant impact on cortisol levels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3848" target="_blank">01:04:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Both the amount of cortisol that you're capable of releasing early in the day and the duration for which that cortisol lasts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3855" target="_blank">01:04:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The first one is, of all things, grapefruit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3858" target="_blank">01:04:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, grapefruit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3859" target="_blank">01:04:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Here I'm talking about the whole fruit, could be pink grapefruit, could be not pink grapefruit, yellow grapefruit, could be grapefruit juice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3866" target="_blank">01:04:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And before I get into the mechanism and the protocol, I should emphasize that the effects of grapefruit on cortisol are not trivial.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3872" target="_blank">01:04:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">They're significant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3873" target="_blank">01:04:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you eat a grapefruit or you drink, I don't know, six to eight ounces of grapefruit juice, it's going to have a meaningful impact on how long the cortisol that's already in your bloodstream lasts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3885" target="_blank">01:04:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The way it does that is grapefruit contains compounds that inhibit the enzymes that break down cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3891" target="_blank">01:04:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In particular, compounds in grapefruit inhibit the action of an enzyme called CYP3A4 and maybe A5 as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3900" target="_blank">01:05:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And that enzyme is responsible in large part for breaking down cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3904" target="_blank">01:05:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not the only way that cortisol is broken down, but it's one of the major ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3908" target="_blank">01:05:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And grapefruit has a significant impact in inhibiting the enzyme that breaks down cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3914" target="_blank">01:05:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Believe it or not, many studies have been done in humans, men and women, and the net takeaway is the same in every case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3920" target="_blank">01:05:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you were to eat a grapefruit, you're going to extend the life of cortisol in your bloodstream by anywhere from 25 to 50%, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3929" target="_blank">01:05:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That's significant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3930" target="_blank">01:05:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it has actually been shown to be clinically significant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3932" target="_blank">01:05:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason I say clinically significant in this case is that indeed there are some people that need to deliberately elevate their cortisol using medication.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3940" target="_blank">01:05:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Those people typically are instructed not to eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice because then they're not going to get as clear a picture on how a given dose of their medication is impacting their cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3951" target="_blank">01:05:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Likewise, people who have chronically elevated cortisol are told not to eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice because it can further elevate their cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3960" target="_blank">01:06:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">However, most people who don't have things like Cushing's disease or Addison's don't have to worry about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3966" target="_blank">01:06:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And most people, probably you, are interested in having a lot more energy get up and go early in the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3972" target="_blank">01:06:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And you now know that elevating your morning cortisol is one way to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3975" target="_blank">01:06:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And many of you presumably don't always have time to exercise or you don't always have time to get morning light.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3981" target="_blank">01:06:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I know it sounds outrageous, but every once in a while you can't get sunlight or bright light into your eyes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3987" target="_blank">01:06:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, you might be thinking about ways that you could increase your cortisol under those conditions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3991" target="_blank">01:06:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, eating a grapefruit would do that or drinking some grapefruit juice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=3994" target="_blank">01:06:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, you can eat a grapefruit or drink some grapefruit juice in combination with all the other things that we've discussed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4000" target="_blank">01:06:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, there are compounds in grapefruit juice that will also extend the effectiveness of caffeine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4004" target="_blank">01:06:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So this effect of grapefruit on the various enzymes that break down things like caffeine and cortisol is a meaningful impact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4012" target="_blank">01:06:52.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not a trivial one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4014" target="_blank">01:06:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so while it might seem kind of silly to say, oh yeah, eat grapefruit to increase your morning energy,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4018" target="_blank">01:06:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">it's actually a real thing that's separable from the effects of grapefruit on say blood sugar that comes from the fructose in grapefruit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4025" target="_blank">01:07:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">that comes from the vitamins and minerals and other things in grapefruit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4028" target="_blank">01:07:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a real and

you get an insight into just how powerful licorice is, or I should say things within licorice are for increasing cortisol levels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4112" target="_blank">01:08:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">What I'm talking about here is a compound called glycerisin.</span></div><div

that if you are going to experiment with licorice or glycerisin that comes from licorice root,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4129" target="_blank">01:08:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">you need to actually be pretty careful to not boost your cortisol levels too much.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

going to eat black licorice, a lot of people like black licorice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4142"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4144" target="_blank">01:09:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's kind of an individual thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

your cortisol too much,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4151" target="_blank">01:09:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">especially if you're eating it later in the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4153" target="_blank">01:09:13.660</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4160" target="_blank">01:09:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it does so by inhibiting the enzyme 11 beta hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase or 11 beta HSD for short.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4170" target="_blank">01:09:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the enzyme

target="_blank">01:09:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So cortisol, when released into the blood, eventually is broken down into a bunch of other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4179" target="_blank">01:09:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And in order to keep the cortisol active, and here we didn't get into a discussion about cortisol either being bound or free, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4188" target="_blank">01:09:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The free form is the one that is active and can impact tissues just like free testosterone can impact tissues as opposed to bound testosterone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4195" target="_blank">01:09:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it's also a steroid hormone, cortisol goes through some of the same regulation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4199" target="_blank">01:09:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The important point here is that licorice can be used to potently increase cortisol, not just the duration of cortisol's impact,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4208" target="_blank">01:10:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">but also apparently the release of cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4211" target="_blank">01:10:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the data on that are a little bit mixed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4213" target="_blank">01:10:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people would even argue that licorice can increase the synthesis of cortisol, but there there's even less data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4219" target="_blank">01:10:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The data are very clear, however, that glycyrrhizin, which is prominently found in black licorice,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4225" target="_blank">01:10:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">you are going to increase the amount of cortisol circulating in your bloodstream.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4229" target="_blank">01:10:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're having a really difficult time boosting your cortisol in the morning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">01:10:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe that's the day that you try a small amount of licorice root or a small amount of black licorice.</span></div><div class="c"><span

cortisol,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4256" target="_blank">01:10:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and cortisol has a potent

its effects on cortisol,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4287" target="_blank">01:11:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">but also that

target="_blank">01:11:52.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember, it all depends on when you woke up, because waking up is actually what triggers that big inflection in cortisol early in the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4318" target="_blank">01:11:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But as your cortisol starts to fall into the early afternoon, late afternoon, and so on, you may notice something, which is you can experience stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4329" target="_blank">01:12:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure. If you have a stress event, you'll get a spike in cortisol and it will come back down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4333" target="_blank">01:12:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you've ever been outside during the middle of the day, got some sunlight in your eyes, maybe sitting with your eyes closed, maybe even relaxing in the sun, you'd probably say getting bright light in my eyes, getting sunlight in the afternoon keeps me calm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4347" target="_blank">01:12:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If anything, it makes me mellower.

Of course, you want to guard yourself against too much UV exposure by wearing clothing or perhaps a mineral-based sunscreen, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4386" target="_blank">01:13:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But getting sunlight in the middle of the day can be a terrific thing for your mood.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4390" target="_blank">01:13:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There are great studies showing that it can enhance hormone production, including testosterone and estrogen, feelings of wellbeing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4396" target="_blank">01:13:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But indeed, getting sunlight and other forms of bright light in your eyes and on your skin in the afternoon tends to make you feel kind of relaxed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4403" target="_blank">01:13:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's because that positive feedback loop that the SCN can trigger, whereby light increases your cortisol, is completely shut down from the hours of about noontime or so until about five or six in the evening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4417" target="_blank">01:13:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">five or six in the evening. Now I say until about five or six in the evening, because in the evening, cortisol is going even lower, lower, lower. But then something happens. The gate, the opportunity for light to start triggering increases in cortisol opens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4432" target="_blank">01:13:52.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you'll soon learn, not only does it open, but it's extra sensitive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4438" target="_blank">01:13:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">put differently in the evening past sundown. So this will be different, different times of year, different locations on earth, but about two hours after sundown or so, any bright light from an artificial source, especially short wavelength light of the type that comes from LEDs and computer screens and phones, that sort of thing, can cause big increases in cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4459" target="_blank">01:14:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And that, of course, provides a perfect segue for us to talk about the things that you should do in the evening and at night to make sure that your cortisol is low and dropping further still.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4468" target="_blank">01:14:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So let's talk about the things to do in the evening and at night in order to "optimize" your cortisol levels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4474" target="_blank">01:14:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I say optimize, of course, there's no optimal exact level. There's no optimal level for one exact time. Everyone's on slightly different schedules.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4483" target="_blank">01:14:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I tend to go to sleep somewhere between 10:00 PM and midnight most nights. Sometimes it's 9:30. Sometimes I'll stay up past midnight. It happens every once in a while.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4490" target="_blank">01:14:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You may go to bed at eight, you may go to bed at 1:00 AM. The point here is that we're focused now on the portion of your endogenous naturally generated cortisol rhythm that occurs in the hours before bedtime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4501" target="_blank">01:15:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">When your goal is to get to sleep and get terrific sleep. And what that requires is that your cortisol is low and continuing to go lower. So there are various things that you should do in the afternoon and evening and nighttime to make sure that pattern occurs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4519" target="_blank">01:15:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The first has to do with lighting. As I just described in the evening, about two hours after sundown is really when this phase of your cortisol cycle begins where not much light is required in order to create big increases in cortisol, which is the exact opposite of what you want in the evening and at night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4538" target="_blank">01:15:38.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You want your cortisol going down, not up. So how do you control your lighting in order to ensure that pattern occurs? There are several ways.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4546" target="_blank">01:15:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, you just dim the indoor lights, right? Dim them as much as possible, especially overhead lights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4552" target="_blank">01:15:52.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The neurons in your eye that send information about overall luminance, how bright it is in your environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4557" target="_blank">01:15:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">They're all over your eye, but they reside primarily in the lower two thirds of your eyes because their role is to view the upper visual field.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4565" target="_blank">01:16:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's how that circuit is arranged. So if you have to have lights on in your indoor environment at night, which most people do, you should dim as many lights as you can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4573" target="_blank">01:16:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Turn off as many overhead lights as you can.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4576" target="_blank">01:16:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Turn off as many overhead lights as you can. Table lamps are better than overhead lights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4579" target="_blank">01:16:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And floor lights are better than table lamps. Most people aren't going to install floor lights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4583" target="_blank">01:16:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you find that you're having trouble mellowing out and getting to sleep, and there isn't some other reason for that, like you drank a bunch of caffeine at 8:00 PM or 6:00 PM, then dimming the lights is going to be a terrific idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4595" target="_blank">01:16:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now the wavelength, the color of those lights can also have a big impact. As I mentioned before, you want to avoid short wavelength light exposure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4604" target="_blank">01:16:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So this would be your white LED lights, blue lights, green lights. If you can, all right, and there are various ways you can do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4611" target="_blank">01:16:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You could purchase a red light bulb. I'm not talking about red light therapy, but there are various sources of red lights that you can install.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4617" target="_blank">01:16:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">They're very inexpensive. Again, it's not red light therapy. It's just restricted such that I'm only getting long wavelength light in my eyes. Why?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4626" target="_blank">01:17:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, there are a number of papers showing that if we restrict our visual exposure to medium and long wavelength light in the evenings and at night, it does not have nearly as much impact on increasing cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4638" target="_blank">01:17:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if it's very, very bright, we're talking like bursting bright red lights, it can increase cortisol even in the evening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4644" target="_blank">01:17:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But if it's relatively bright to dim red light or amber colored light of the sort that you would get with an incandescent bulb, as opposed to an LED bulb, that's going to keep cortisol low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4654" target="_blank">01:17:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And the effect of these lighting changes is not trivial. These are meaningful protocols that will actually help keep your cortisol low, help keep you calm and mellow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4663" target="_blank">01:17:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And of course, you should dim the screen on your phone and your computer. There's actually a way if you have an Apple phone that you can very easily program in a triple click shortcut so that your screen turns red.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4674" target="_blank">01:17:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We can provide an instruction of how to do that in the show note captions. It takes about two minutes to do. I have this on all my phone devices so it can triple click on the side and then it brings your phone screen from its standard luminance to basically a red screen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4688" target="_blank">01:18:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So it cuts out all the short wavelength light. And of course, if you're interested in using glasses that restrict short wavelength light, as some of you probably know, I worked in collaboration with Roka glasses to develop what we call the wind down glasses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4700" target="_blank">01:18:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">They're not just blue blockers. They don't just cut out the blue wavelengths of the visual spectrum. They cut out all the short wavelength light that can stimulate the cells that can increase cortisol and so on and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4710" target="_blank">01:18:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So the glasses are convenient because oftentimes you don't have control over your indoor lighting environment, right? If you're out to dinner or you're in a hotel, you didn't bring a red light bulb, this kind of thing. You go into the bathroom, you know, what are you going to do there if the red light bulb is in the bedroom and this kind of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4725" target="_blank">01:18:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So you could use those, you could use the red light bulb, certainly dim all the lights that you can. This makes a meaningful and powerful contribution to keeping your cortisol levels low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4734" target="_blank">01:18:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It will also prevent you from reducing levels of melatonin, which is the hormone that makes you sleepy at night. So as cortisol is going down, melatonin is going up in the evening and at night, and that's what you want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4745" target="_blank">01:19:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You want cortisol as low as possible. You want melatonin as high as possible. Keep in mind that bright light, especially short wavelength bright light, so blues, greens, et cetera, the type that comes from white light from screens, unless you do something to alter that light, is going to be a potent stimulus for increasing cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4763" target="_blank">01:19:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And for decreasing melatonin. And here I should remind you that you know exactly why even moderately bright light, that short wavelength light in the evening is so effective at increasing cortisol because cortisol levels are so low that negative feedback loop, right? Your hypothalamus is registering the levels of cortisol in your system in the evening. And they're very, very low. So it is primed to make more cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4788" target="_blank">01:19:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If it needs to. This again is an ancient mechanism by which your brain has learned how to control levels of cortisol in your bloodstream so that they're never too high or too low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4797" target="_blank">01:19:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And presumably this creates an adaptive advantage whereby, you know, if you got into some sort of trouble in the evening and needed to escape a predator or whatever, maybe you need to stay up all night in order to search for food because food had been scarce in the previous days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4811" target="_blank">01:20:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You could do that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4812" target="_blank">01:20:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You could do that, right? Your cortisol levels are very low and you can stimulate them to increase very easily. Put differently, it's very easy to stress at night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4818" target="_blank">01:20:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very easy to create increases in cortisol because your endogenous, your circadian levels of cortisol are so low. So you have to be very careful not to trigger yourself to not create these inflections in cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4830" target="_blank">01:20:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're somebody who's noticed that in the evening, you tend to be a bit more reactive, that things that you see online or different conversations you might have by text or thoughts within your head tend to make you more anxious later in the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4842" target="_blank">01:20:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, that's probably because you're experiencing these sharp inflections in cortisol relative to your already low, appropriately low, I should say, levels of baseline cortisol at those times of evening and night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4852" target="_blank">01:20:52.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a few other things you should do to keep your cortisol low. And then I'll talk about some of the things that you can do to proactively keep your cortisol low. Meaning the to do is not just the don'ts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4861" target="_blank">01:21:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">A couple of other do nots are things like ingesting caffeine. This is kind of an obvious one, right? I tend to drink a lot of caffeine early in the day for reasons you now understand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4871" target="_blank">01:21:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You may drink your caffeine early in the day as well, perhaps in the early afternoon. If you're having trouble falling and staying asleep throughout the night, maybe just waking up once in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, which is fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4882" target="_blank">01:21:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're finding that you're waking up multiple times during the night, or you're not waking up feeling fully rested, you should really explore how late in the day you're continuing to consume caffeine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4890" target="_blank">01:21:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I recommend a cutoff of about 2:00 PM. Now I'm very caffeine tolerant. So for some people, noon might be the cutoff, for other people, 4:00 PM might be that cutoff. But in general, because most people go to sleep sometime between 9:30 PM and 11:30 PM, it's a good idea to cut your caffeine intake off somewhere around 2:30 or 3:00 PM at the very latest so that you can fall and stay asleep easily.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4913" target="_blank">01:21:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember, caffeine is not necessarily increasing your cortisol that much if you're a chronic caffeine user, but it's extending the life of cortisol so that that cortisol curve, that level of cortisol in your bloodstream is going to come down more slowly if you're drinking caffeine in the late afternoon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4928" target="_blank">01:22:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The other one is of course, to limit your stress. Now I've done entire episodes about stress and stress is a multifaceted thing. We can't always limit our stress. Life, I should say even a good life includes stress, short-term stress, long-term stress, long-term stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4943" target="_blank">01:22:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll talk more about chronic long-term stress in a little bit. We're certainly going to talk about burnout and the different types of burnout that can result from different kinds of stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4951" target="_blank">01:22:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But here's the key point about limiting your stress. The best things you can do for stress involve controlling your stress response in real time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4959" target="_blank">01:22:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. I'm a big fan of meditation. I'm a big fan of getting great sleep every night. I'm a big fan of vacations. However, when stress hits, we don't often have the opportunity to take a vacation, get a massage, do meditation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4972" target="_blank">01:22:52.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you do great, but most people don't have that level of control over their life in the moment. So having tools that you can deploy to deal with stress in real time and bring your levels of what we call sympathetic autonomic nervous system activity, which is just nerd speak for stress down, is going to be very useful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4989" target="_blank">01:23:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And the best tool that I'm aware of that's backed by terrific science, not just from my lab, I have been involved in some of the science, but from other laboratories as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=4997" target="_blank">01:23:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And the body of research on this is ever expanding. And it all points in the same direction, which is that exhale emphasized breathing slows your heart rate down through a process called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5008" target="_blank">01:23:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And exhale emphasized breathing engages the diaphragm, which helps balance levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen in your bloodstream and brain in ways that bring your levels of stress down all very quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5021" target="_blank">01:23:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, and I know some of you have heard this before, the fastest way to calm down in real time is going to be the so-called physiological sigh, which is just a big deep inhale through your nose, then a second sharp inhale to try and maximally inflate your lungs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5036" target="_blank">01:23:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then a long exhale until your lungs are empty. And that long exhale should be done through your mouth. Even though I've demonstrated this many times before, I'm going to demonstrate it again. For those of you that haven't seen it, it goes like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5061" target="_blank">01:24:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. I can feel my heart rate go down. You can probably even just hear it in my voice. The timbre of the voice and your levels of autonomic activation are very closely linked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5071" target="_blank">01:24:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We all know this because when people are really stressed, they sound stressed. And when they're relaxed, they sound more down here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5076" target="_blank">01:24:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. It's really key that the first inhale be a big, long, deliberate inhale through your nose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5082" target="_blank">01:24:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really key that the second inhale be also through your nose, even though it's a sharp little inhale where you're not sneaking much air in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5088" target="_blank">01:24:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It causes maximal inflation of all the little sacks in your lungs. And then that allows you to maximally offload carbon dioxide when you do that long to lungs empty exhale.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5100" target="_blank">01:25:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The whole thing, as you just saw, probably takes about 30, 40 seconds, maybe a minute maximum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5105" target="_blank">01:25:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it is the fastest and most effective way to calm yourself down in real time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5111" target="_blank">01:25:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're experiencing stress, especially in the evening and nighttime hours, do one to three physiological sighs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5118" target="_blank">01:25:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you can't remember to do that because you're so stressed, just do some emphasized exhale breathing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5123" target="_blank">01:25:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Just, just think about dumping your air through your mouth until your lungs are empty and then do a physiological sigh or two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5130" target="_blank">01:25:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't overemphasize just how powerful this tool is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5134" target="_blank">01:25:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There have been now recordings of what's going on in the brain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5137" target="_blank">01:25:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">People have looked at what's happening with carbon dioxide and oxygen ratios.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5140" target="_blank">01:25:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Your heart rate slows down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5142" target="_blank">01:25:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a bunch of things that all contribute to shifting your autonomic nervous system from a more sympathetic activated mode to parasympathetic so-called rest and digest mode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5151" target="_blank">01:25:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it happens very, very quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5154" target="_blank">01:25:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So use breathing as a way to deal with stress in the evening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5158" target="_blank">01:25:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, it's a potent technique and it's one that then puts you into the mental frame of being able to do the other things that you need to do in order to keep your cortisol low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5167" target="_blank">01:26:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Like make sure that the lights are dim to make sure that you're not engaging in any kind of texting or online activity late at night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5172" target="_blank">01:26:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That's going to further exacerbate your stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5174" target="_blank">01:26:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The diabolical thing about stress is that when we are more stressed, when our sympathetic nervous system is activated, we tend to do more things that make us more stressed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5183" target="_blank">01:26:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">This has to do with some of the adaptive nature of stress, why it's wired into us in the way that it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5188" target="_blank">01:26:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But what I can tell you is if you can bring your levels of autonomic activation down, calm yourself down, you have a lot more agency and control to direct your behavior and even to direct your thinking, the patterns of internal dialogue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5200" target="_blank">01:26:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can navigate your nighttime and evening much more effectively, even if you are facing a night where you know you're going to get less sleep, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5208" target="_blank">01:26:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The thoughts about, "Oh, what would have then if I can't fall asleep and then tomorrow?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5211" target="_blank">01:26:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">All of that can be dealt with if you just bring your levels of autonomic activation down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5216" target="_blank">01:26:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So the breathing tool plus dimming the lights is going to be very effective for doing that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5220" target="_blank">01:27:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The other thing that you can do to bring your cortisol levels down in the evening and at nighttime is to consume some starchy carbohydrates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5228" target="_blank">01:27:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I know I've talked a lot before about how most people should probably not eat for the two hours before they go to sleep or ideally even the three hours before they go to sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5237" target="_blank">01:27:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to be real honest with you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5238" target="_blank">01:27:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I find it hard to fall asleep when I'm really hungry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5241" target="_blank">01:27:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So if it means having a small snack an hour or even 30 minutes before bed, I'll sometimes do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5246" target="_blank">01:27:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But ideally you're not eating anything for about two hours before you go to sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5250" target="_blank">01:27:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">However, if you just have such gnawing hunger that you can't fall asleep, then you're going to have to eat something closer to bedtime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5256" target="_blank">01:27:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we should give ourselves permission to strike a balance between not having gnawing hunger that prevents us from sleeping and also not eating too close to bedtime, which can impair the quality of your sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5267" target="_blank">01:27:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And indeed it can also impair the release of growth hormone in the first hours of sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5272" target="_blank">01:27:52.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I recommend is eating in the evening and at nighttime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5277" target="_blank">01:27:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I usually eat dinner somewhere around, you know, ideally for me, it would be 6:30 to 8:30, somewhere in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5283" target="_blank">01:28:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm flexible with these things depending on my schedule, depending on the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5286" target="_blank">01:28:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But if I'm going to eat dinner somewhere around 7:30 PM, I try to get some starchy carbohydrates in that meal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5294" target="_blank">01:28:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I tend to eat pretty moderate to low carb throughout the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5297" target="_blank">01:28:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then in the evening for my last meal, which again comes around 7:30 PM for me, 7:00 PM, I make sure that I have some starches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5305" target="_blank">01:28:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I have some rice or I have some potatoes or yams, or, you know, I like clean starches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5310" target="_blank">01:28:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So I tend to focus on those things, maybe some homemade pasta, whatever you're eating for starches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5314" target="_blank">01:28:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">What you'll find is that eating starches in the evening will help keep your cortisol low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5318" target="_blank">01:28:38.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And guess what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5319" target="_blank">01:28:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's absolutely obvious why that would be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5322" target="_blank">01:28:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Also, guess what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5323" target="_blank">01:28:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You know why, you know the mechanism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5326" target="_blank">01:28:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember, cortisol's main job is not to deal with stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5330" target="_blank">01:28:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It does that, but it's to deploy blood glucose so that you can deal, yes, with stress, but with all sorts of things in your schedule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5338" target="_blank">01:28:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Anything that requires energy and activity and certainly energy of the brain, but also energy of the body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5344" target="_blank">01:29:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So when you hear that there are quote unquote comfort foods, those foods tend to be things that are very carbohydrate laden because those increase your blood glucose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5353" target="_blank">01:29:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And when your blood glucose levels are elevated, cortisol is not as readily released.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5359" target="_blank">01:29:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to say that again, when your blood glucose levels are elevated, your cortisol levels tend to stay low as well because it's not as readily released.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5367" target="_blank">01:29:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a reason why people find that carbohydrates kind of calm them down, that they're comfort foods and that they relax them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5374" target="_blank">01:29:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's because they don't directly suppress cortisol, but they act through the blood sugar regulation mechanisms that feed back to the hypothalamus to control release of cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5384" target="_blank">01:29:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a couple of steps there in between, but think about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5387" target="_blank">01:29:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The hypothalamus, the structure over the roof of your mouth that contains the neurons that can trigger the release of more cortisol or suppress its release.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5394" target="_blank">01:29:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">They're in a position because remember they're paraventricular and they have access to what's going on in the bloodstream to register levels of blood glucose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5402" target="_blank">01:30:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so when blood glucose levels are elevated, and I'm not talking about extra high or, you know, pathologically high, I'm talking about, you know, after you have some pasta or you have a bowl of rice or you have some oatmeal or whatever your favorite starchy carbohydrate is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5415" target="_blank">01:30:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">the probability that you're going to release cortisol is going to be reduced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5419" target="_blank">01:30:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And the probability that you're going to continue to make cortisol at high levels is going to be reduced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5424" target="_blank">01:30:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the evening, or at least for your last meal of the day, having some starches, if that's within your nutritional plan, is a good idea if your goal is to keep cortisol low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5434" target="_blank">01:30:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And guess what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5435" target="_blank">01:30:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Your goal should be to keep cortisol low because you want to be relaxed in the evening and be able to sleep easily.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5440" target="_blank">01:30:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, this opens up a broader conversation about what nutrition does in its different forms, high carb, low carb, et cetera, to cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5449" target="_blank">01:30:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's a key takeaway, and I'm going to keep this very brief because in a future episode, we could really go down the rabbit hole of how different diets impact different hormones, including cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5457" target="_blank">01:30:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But the big takeaway here is they've done studies that explore low carbohydrate diets versus more typical carbohydrate diets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5465" target="_blank">01:31:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">When I say low versus typical, the general contour of these across studies is something like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5470" target="_blank">01:31:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">What they call low carb means fewer than 30% of calories coming from carbohydrate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5475" target="_blank">01:31:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's the key takeaway.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5477" target="_blank">01:31:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If somebody goes on a low carbohydrate diet and they've not been on a low carbohydrate diet, so fewer than 30% of daily calories from carbohydrates, maybe even lower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5485" target="_blank">01:31:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So it could be, you know, 5%, could be 20%, but relatively low carbohydrates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5490" target="_blank">01:31:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">For the first three weeks that they're on that diet, you see a significant, it's not an enormous, but you see a statistically significant increase in cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5498" target="_blank">01:31:38.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it matches the normal endogenous pattern that they already, which frankly, everybody expresses, which is higher in the morning, lower in the afternoon and evening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5508" target="_blank">01:31:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not like the endogenous pattern is thrown off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5510" target="_blank">01:31:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just that curve is kind of shifted up a bit at various points, not every point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5514" target="_blank">01:31:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">However, after about three weeks on that low carbohydrate diet, it normalizes, it comes back to their original level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5520" target="_blank">01:32:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now there's a lot of opportunity for speculation in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5522" target="_blank">01:32:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Like we could say, wait, after three weeks, the people on the low carb diet, their cortisol levels came back down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5528" target="_blank">01:32:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that mean that their blood glucose levels went up?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5530" target="_blank">01:32:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That doesn't appear to be the reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5532" target="_blank">01:32:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There could be some other compensatory mechanisms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5534" target="_blank">01:32:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But the basic takeaway here is if you're on a low carbohydrate diet already, and that's working for you, you're able to sleep at night just fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5542" target="_blank">01:32:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that's probably the key thing that you should be asking yourself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5547" target="_blank">01:32:27.660</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:32:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If your sleep is great, terrific.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5550" target="_blank">01:32:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If it's not, maybe you want to explore introducing some starchy carbohydrates to your last meal of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5555" target="_blank">01:32:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">See how that goes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5556" target="_blank">01:32:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In any case, if you're on a low carbohydrate diet and you're sleeping fine, I wouldn't worry about its net impact on your cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5564" target="_blank">01:32:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the studies I just described point to the fact that it's not chronically long-term increasing your cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5571" target="_blank">01:32:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're somebody who's moving from a higher carbohydrate diet to a lower carbohydrate diet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5576" target="_blank">01:32:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">and you're noticing that you're, I don't know, feeling a bit more stress, higher levels of sympathetic autonomic arousal,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5581" target="_blank">01:33:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">you're feeling a little more activated.</span></div><div class="c"><span

transition, that's to be expected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5587" target="_blank">01:33:07.660</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5593" target="_blank">01:33:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, the relationship between starchy carbohydrates, glucose increases, and the relationship between cortisol</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5600" target="_blank">01:33:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">being a mobilizer of glucose makes it all very, very clear as to why there's this relationship between carbohydrate intake and cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5607" target="_blank">01:33:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">They're in a kind of a reciprocal relationship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5609" target="_blank">01:33:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the one caveat to that is, indeed, if you are dealing with metabolic syndrome, like you are insulin insensitive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5617" target="_blank">01:33:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">because you've been ingesting too many calories or too many carbohydrates, in particular, too many simple sugars, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5622" target="_blank">01:33:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">All the things that can start to lead to insulin insensitivity, where you start cranking out more and more glucose</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5628" target="_blank">01:33:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">because your insulin isn't doing such a good job of getting that glucose to your cells, what we call insulin insensitivity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5634" target="_blank">01:33:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Nowadays, people refer to it as metabolic syndrome, although that's a much bigger theme.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5638" target="_blank">01:33:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, then, keep in mind that your cortisol levels will go up as you have less ability to use the glucose that you're making.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5646" target="_blank">01:34:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And guess what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5647" target="_blank">01:34:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That makes perfect sense because as you can't use the glucose that you're making, it doesn't matter if your blood glucose levels are high</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5653" target="_blank">01:34:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">because that hypothalamus, it also needs to respond to glucose in an insulin-dependent way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5659" target="_blank">01:34:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It needs to actually be able to use those high levels of glucose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5662" target="_blank">01:34:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So, again, the relationship between glucose and insulin sensitivity and cortisol all jibes perfectly well when we think about mechanisms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5670" target="_blank">01:34:30.660</a></span> |

them, let's say you're under the bright lights at night because you're working late or you're at a concert, fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5734" target="_blank">01:35:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I think by now you already are realizing that the kind of ideal situation, regardless of whether or not you wake up later in the day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5742" target="_blank">01:35:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">or you wake up at 5:00 AM or you're like Jocko, you wake up at 4:30 AM and you get into your exercise right away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5748" target="_blank">01:35:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The ideal situation for your cortisol rhythm would be to exercise early in the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5753" target="_blank">01:35:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I realize not everyone is an early riser.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5756" target="_blank">01:35:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So when they hear that, they think, oh, I don't want to exercise early in the day or I can't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5759" target="_blank">01:35:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not saying you necessarily have to exercise right as you wake up, but when you are thinking about your cortisol rhythm,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5764" target="_blank">01:36:04.660</a></span> | <span class="t">the ideal pattern of exercise and cortisol release would be where you exercise early in the day after sunlight exposure or under bright light exposure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5771" target="_blank">01:36:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We talked about all that before, but let's face it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5774" target="_blank">01:36:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people can't exercise early in the day and certainly not every day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5777" target="_blank">01:36:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We have schedules, we have constraints, and it's very important that we get our resistance training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5781" target="_blank">01:36:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's very important that we get our cardiovascular exercise on a regular basis.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5785" target="_blank">01:36:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're somebody who prefers to exercise at noontime or 1:00 PM or 2:00 PM or 3:00 PM, great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5793" target="_blank">01:36:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You already know, based on what we described about the endogenous pattern of cortisol release,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5799" target="_blank">01:36:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">that that's a time of day when it's really hard to trigger a positive feedback loop on cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5804" target="_blank">01:36:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you have a really grueling, hard, intense workout at 2:00 PM, and before that you drank an energy drink or a big cup of coffee,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5812" target="_blank">01:36:52.660</a></span> | <span class="t">or if you're me, some yerba mate plus a big cup of coffee, maybe an alpha GPC every once in a while, I'll do that and then hit the gym really hard in the early afternoon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5819" target="_blank">01:36:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I prefer to do that in the morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5821" target="_blank">01:37:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't always take all those things before I work out, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5825" target="_blank">01:37:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Only before resistance training do I drink caffeine usually.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5827" target="_blank">01:37:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And only before really hard workouts do I do things besides drink caffeine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5832" target="_blank">01:37:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll do caffeine and alpha GPC and, you know, in some cases, a lot of caffeine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5836" target="_blank">01:37:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But I get it. You know, some of you like to work out in the afternoon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5839" target="_blank">01:37:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And actually, if you look at the data on resistance training and athletic performance, the bulk of it points to the fact that performance at those activities, strength tends to be greater in the afternoon as opposed to the morning for most people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5853" target="_blank">01:37:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But the basic takeaway is train when you can train when it's available to you, but you don't want to spike your cortisol too late in the day so that it disrupts your sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5864" target="_blank">01:37:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So the good news is that if you train resistance training or cardiovascular exercise, doesn't matter, or a combination of the two if that's what you're doing, if you end up doing that in the early afternoon or even as late as sundown, you're probably going to be okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5878" target="_blank">01:37:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Your cortisol rhythm is still going to continue to drop. Your endogenous cortisol rhythm is going to continue to drop into the late evening and nighttime hours and you'll be allowed to sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5889" target="_blank">01:38:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, you will have to do certain things to ensure that happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5892" target="_blank">01:38:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I would suggest eating some starchy carbohydrates, especially after a hard resistance training workout that comes later in the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5899" target="_blank">01:38:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">A hard, that is a moderate to high intensity exercise session has been shown to triple or quadruple your cortisol levels when it comes later in the day or in the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5908" target="_blank">01:38:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And remember, that's a time when your basal, your endogenous cortisol levels are very, very low. So you get this big inflection in cortisol from the workout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5915" target="_blank">01:38:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're going to work out much later in the day, like you're getting off work at 5:00 or 6:00 PM or 7:00 PM, I've had phases of my life when this was the case for me and I still want to get my gym workout in and it's bright lights in the gym.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5926" target="_blank">01:38:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I wasn't somebody who wore sunglasses in the gym. Sorry, back then we didn't have the wind down glasses. I wish I had had them. They would be great for a gym workout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5933" target="_blank">01:38:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But I will caution you, those glasses do make it hard to see certain boundaries between objects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5938" target="_blank">01:38:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And you always want to prioritize safety over everything else. So if you're in a gym, bright lights, working out at 5:00 or 6:00 PM, you do your hard workout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5946" target="_blank">01:39:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">When you walk out of there, your cortisol levels are ratcheted way up. This is just the reality. And there are good data on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5953" target="_blank">01:39:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that's not necessarily a problem, but your goal is to fall asleep that night. So it would be very wise to certainly get some quality protein, but also some starchy carbohydrate, probably some fruit or something else to really get your glycogen stores replenished again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5968" target="_blank">01:39:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But you're also going to want to do some long exhale breathing. Maybe just take two or three minutes and do some long exhale breathing after your workout in your car before you drive home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5977" target="_blank">01:39:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Or when you get home, you want to take a hot shower. Great. If you can sit in the sauna, then take a warm shower, kind of a neutral shower, not a cold shower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5986" target="_blank">01:39:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That's going to like blast your stress levels up. You know, take a nice mellow shower. You just want to do some things to bring your cortisol levels down, increase the levels of that parasympathetic autonomic activity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=5997" target="_blank">01:39:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Long exhale breathing, starchy carbohydrates, dim the lights, hot showers, great. Sauna, if you have access to it, take everything down a notch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6005" target="_blank">01:40:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then certainly, certainly don't stimulate your nervous system with bright light of any kind, right? Red light, dim light, wind down glasses, all that's going to help you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6014" target="_blank">01:40:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But don't get on your phone or computer right before getting into bed because you've already spiked your cortisol from that workout and your basal cortisol levels are low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6023" target="_blank">01:40:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's a perfect time to send yourself into later hours of the night when your cortisol is way too high.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6030" target="_blank">01:40:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And the big problem there is not only will it disrupt your nighttime sleep, but it also disrupts your next morning cortisol levels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6038" target="_blank">01:40:38.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to remind you how that happens in a moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6040" target="_blank">01:40:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But before we do that, I'm going to remind you of this really terrific study that we discussed at the beginning of this episode was, I'll repeat the title again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6047" target="_blank">01:40:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">24 hour pattern of the episodic secretion of cortisol in normal subjects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6051" target="_blank">01:40:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And remember, there's this phase one, they've referred to it as a six hour period of minimal secretory activity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6058" target="_blank">01:40:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That means extremely low levels of cortisol being released that spans from four hours before and two hours after lights out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6067" target="_blank">01:41:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Four hours before and two hours after going to sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6070" target="_blank">01:41:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That's when you want your cortisol lowest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6073" target="_blank">01:41:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're working out in the late evening and closer to sleep, you're going to need to do a number of things to really try and offset any increases in cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6082" target="_blank">01:41:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's so critical that you get this phase one correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6086" target="_blank">01:41:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason is if your cortisol is spiked, then even if you do a bunch of things to be able to fall asleep, you're going to blunt your next morning cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6095" target="_blank">01:41:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And you know why that would be the case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6097" target="_blank">01:41:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Think about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6098" target="_blank">01:41:38.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The whole rhythm in cortisol is generated by this negative feedback loop where if cortisol levels get too high, your hypothalamus suppresses the creation of more cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6109" target="_blank">01:41:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So if at night when your cortisol is supposed to be especially low, you spike your cortisol and it stays up too long.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6116" target="_blank">01:41:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You don't do things to bring it down after a workout or you drank too much caffeine before that workout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6120" target="_blank">01:42:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you really are up late and the whole thing starts to span into the hours that you really should be sleeping.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6126" target="_blank">01:42:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">What's going to happen?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6127" target="_blank">01:42:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">What's going to happen is the next morning your cortisol levels are going to be suppressed because your hypothalamus is seeing levels of cortisol that are far too high, much higher than normal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6138" target="_blank">01:42:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the next morning you're going to feel sluggish.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6140" target="_blank">01:42:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to have a hard time waking up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6142" target="_blank">01:42:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to have a really hard time focusing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6144" target="_blank">01:42:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to feel like you're in a fog.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6146" target="_blank">01:42:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And most people deal with this by what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6148" target="_blank">01:42:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">By drinking more caffeine, which on its own is not a terribly bad thing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6151" target="_blank">01:42:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's going to prolong the release of cortisol, but it's not going to spike the increase in cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6156" target="_blank">01:42:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you screw up and you train too late and you drank caffeine before and you don't have the opportunity to dim the lights, you're not doing your long exhale breathing and you have this, you know, you basically are eating into the hours that you should be sleeping.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6169" target="_blank">01:42:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Or you spike your cortisol some other way, you get into an argument before sleep or you're up late because you're dealing with some stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6176" target="_blank">01:42:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Guess what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6177" target="_blank">01:42:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The next morning, especially if you've had a shortened night of sleep, especially if you had stress the night before of any kind, you want to take an extra effort to spike your cortisol levels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6188" target="_blank">01:43:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You're going to need to try and boost your cortisol levels even higher through bright light, hydration, maybe not exercising again if you already trained the night before, maybe cold shower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6198" target="_blank">01:43:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You're really going to want to do all the things you can to try and spike your cortisol so that at least the next day and the next night your cortisol levels are back on track.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6207" target="_blank">01:43:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So many people get this wrong and for years I got this wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6211" target="_blank">01:43:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I would occasionally work out in the morning, then I'd work out in the evening and then I noticed that my schedule just was getting tougher and tougher to adhere to because some mornings I was dragging, other mornings I was feeling great because I got to bed early the night before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6222" target="_blank">01:43:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The whole thing was kind of a mess.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6224" target="_blank">01:43:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If I had only understood that if I were to have some stress the night before going to sleep, anytime in that first secretory phase as it's referred to, the four hours before and the two hours after sleep, any stress that eats into that period, whether it's exercise caused or psychologically caused, excuse me, whatever, needed to be offset by spiking my morning cortisol more using the various tools that I've described.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6247" target="_blank">01:44:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So you now understand the global rhythm in cortisol higher in the morning and you want to amplify that lower in the afternoon and evening, you know, dropping in the early afternoon, later afternoon and evening, and then ideally staying low at nighttime so that they can come back up again in the morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6264" target="_blank">01:44:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're exercising late in the day, that's when you can do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6266" target="_blank">01:44:26.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That's when you like to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6267" target="_blank">01:44:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6268" target="_blank">01:44:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But do things to bring your cortisol levels back down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6271" target="_blank">01:44:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6272" target="_blank">01:44:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's talk about compounds, AKA supplements that one can take to reduce their cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6276" target="_blank">01:44:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Since your goal is to reduce your cortisol in the evening and at night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6280" target="_blank">01:44:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There are many supplements that have been purported to reduce cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6283" target="_blank">01:44:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">These include things like ashwagandha, apigenin, which we'll discuss things like phosphatidylserine, even rhodiola.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6290" target="_blank">01:44:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There are a long list of things that have been purported to reduce cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6293" target="_blank">01:44:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">However, there's a short list of things that have been shown to do that relatively potently and to act pretty quickly and that are generally available out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6302" target="_blank">01:45:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The most commonly discussed one in the context of reducing cortisol is ashwagandha.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6306" target="_blank">01:45:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if you look at the literature on ashwagandha, you will see that indeed it can be effective in reducing cortisol levels by anywhere from about 11% to 29%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6316" target="_blank">01:45:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And there may be studies that fall outside those margins, but if you look at the best studies, that's really what it points to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6322" target="_blank">01:45:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, here's a key thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6324" target="_blank">01:45:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You already know that you want your cortisol levels relatively high to high early in the morning and through the mid morning and dropping into the early afternoon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6334" target="_blank">01:45:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And you want them low in the late afternoon and at night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6337" target="_blank">01:45:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're going to experiment with ashwagandha as a means to reduce your cortisol levels, and you're going to take ashwagandha at the dosages that significantly decrease cortisol levels, which would be dosages somewhere between 300 milligrams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6351" target="_blank">01:45:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been explored all the way up to 900 milligrams, but typically I would recommend if you're going to explore ashwagandha that you would explore lower dosages somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 milligrams, at least to start, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6360" target="_blank">01:46:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You always want to look for the minimal effective dose that you restrict your intake of ashwagandha to the late afternoon and evening and nighttime hours to keep your cortisol levels low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6370" target="_blank">01:46:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And that you avoid taking dosages of ashwagandha certainly as high as 300 milligrams anytime early in the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6377" target="_blank">01:46:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, if you're going to take ashwagandha and it is contained in various compound blends like AG1 and other things, but at very low levels, low milligram count, that's going to be fine early in the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6387" target="_blank">01:46:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Anything less than say 50 or a hundred milligrams early in the day, not going to have a significant impact on cortisol, but taken later in the day in order to reduce your levels of cortisol, 300 milligrams, 600 milligrams,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6399" target="_blank">01:46:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">that really should just be restricted to later in the day for obvious reasons, or at least they should be obvious to you now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6406" target="_blank">01:46:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So, as I mentioned, there are data pointing to the fact that ashwagandha can reduce cortisol levels by a significant degree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6413" target="_blank">01:46:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You still need to do, and ideally you are already doing all the various things to reduce your cortisol levels before you even take ashwagandha or experiment with it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6422" target="_blank">01:47:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I always recommend that you do the behavioral things first and then decide whether or not you need supplementation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6433" target="_blank">01:47:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So, dimming the lights, not drinking too much caffeine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6435" target="_blank">01:47:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're exercising, bring your levels of autonomic arouse down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6438" target="_blank">01:47:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">All the things I just talked about a moment ago, you have to be doing those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6442" target="_blank">01:47:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not going to be sufficient to just take 300 to 600 milligrams of ashwagandha and keep your cortisol levels low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6448" target="_blank">01:47:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're blasting your eyes with bright light, you're under a lot of stress at night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6451" target="_blank">01:47:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But because it can produce a significant reduction in cortisol, it can augment your overall program for trying to keep cortisol low in the evening and at night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6460" target="_blank">01:47:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The other compound that some of you might be interested in for reducing cortisol levels again in the evening and at night is apigenin.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6467" target="_blank">01:47:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Apigenin is found in chamomile tea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6469" target="_blank">01:47:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Chamomile tea is long known to be a, you know, sort of relaxing agent, but apigenin comes from chamomile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6476" target="_blank">01:47:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You can take apigenin as a concentrated capsule, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6481" target="_blank">01:48:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6482" target="_blank">01:48:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's actually in the sleep stack that I've taken for years and that I don't recommend in the sense that everyone has to take it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6488" target="_blank">01:48:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But I've talked about apigenin before in the context of the so-called Huberman lab sleep stack, which is a stack of apigenin, magnesium threonate, which by the way is interchangeable with bisglycinate for sleep, but threonate is going to be better for a variety of reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6502" target="_blank">01:48:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So apigenin, magnesium threonate and theanine is the so-called Huberman lab sleep stack that has worked exceptionally well for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6510" target="_blank">01:48:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I've taken it for many years, apigenin because it works on both the GABA pathway and some chloride channel pathways has been shown to decrease cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6519" target="_blank">01:48:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now it's not as big an effect on reducing cortisol as is ashwagandha at dosages of 300 milligrams or more, but I take 50 milligrams of apigenin capsule form every night before I go to sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6531" target="_blank">01:48:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been doing that for well over eight years now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6534" target="_blank">01:48:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And we'll continue to because I find it's very helpful for my sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6537" target="_blank">01:48:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's a great opportunity for me to also say that there's evidence that mag threonate can indirectly activate pathways that might further help suppress cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6546" target="_blank">01:49:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So it makes sense why the sleep stack would include apigenin, why apigenin can be useful for sleep is reducing cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6553" target="_blank">01:49:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, the four hours before sleep and the two hours after sleep are this key time for keeping cortisol low.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6559" target="_blank">01:49:19.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The logic I'm using is that apigenin is useful for enough things related to sleep and reducing cortisol that it makes sense to keep in my evening routine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6568" target="_blank">01:49:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I do take ashwagandha at a dosage of 300 milligrams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6571" target="_blank">01:49:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I take it of course in the evening and at night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6574" target="_blank">01:49:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're going to do anything to reduce your cortisol in the evening and at night, the best timing for that is going to be some time after dinner, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6580" target="_blank">01:49:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not going to say it's always 30 minutes before sleep or 60 minutes before sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6584" target="_blank">01:49:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I tend to take apigenin and magnesium threonate about 30 to 60 minutes before I want to fall asleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6590" target="_blank">01:49:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But the ashwagandha can come pretty much at any time in the evening with dinner or after dinner, frankly, its effects are known to last many hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6600" target="_blank">01:50:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's the time when you want your cortisol lowest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6603" target="_blank">01:50:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to reiterate supplementation should never be the first line of attack when you're trying to adjust some biological mechanism or some health metric.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6611" target="_blank">01:50:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there are cases where people need prescription medication for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6614" target="_blank">01:50:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I do think when it comes to supplementation that you not only get the best effects, but you understand whether something's working for you at a given dosage, if it's worth your money and time, et cetera, only once you're doing all the behavioral things right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6627" target="_blank">01:50:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't emphasize this enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6629" target="_blank">01:50:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Unless you're getting your behavioral steps correct, supplementation just doesn't make a whole lot of sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6634" target="_blank">01:50:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That said, rational supplementation with things like ashwagandha and apigenin, maybe magnesium threonate as well, they make sense from a mechanistic level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6643" target="_blank">01:50:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There are decent enough studies in humans to support their use for reducing cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

the 24 hour cycle, I do think they can be a useful tool, which is why I take them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6655"

They're trying to do all the things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6854" target="_blank">01:54:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're just like, they don't even have the energy to do them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6856" target="_blank">01:54:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And they just can't get into gear.

As you can see, those are two very distinct patterns of stress, of burnout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6876" target="_blank">01:54:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you can imagine, they require perhaps the same steps or different steps,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6881" target="_blank">01:54:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">but certainly at different times in order to resolve that burnout, in order to fix it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6886" target="_blank">01:54:46.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You now know what those steps are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6889" target="_blank">01:54:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But first you have to ask yourself, if you're burnt out, which pattern are you suffering from?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6893" target="_blank">01:54:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I know a number of you are going to shout out, I'm suffering from both of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6897" target="_blank">01:54:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm like exhausted all day and morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6899" target="_blank">01:54:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6900" target="_blank">01:55:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">We could easily create a third category of burnout whereby you're just exhausted all the time, morning, day and night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6907" target="_blank">01:55:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you're really exhausted at night, why aren't you falling asleep?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6910" target="_blank">01:55:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Probably because your mind is racing and you're too stressed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6912" target="_blank">01:55:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You're falling asleep and then you're waking up after a couple of hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6914" target="_blank">01:55:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So you fit probably more into the second pattern of burnout, late phase burnout, as opposed to early phase burnout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6922" target="_blank">01:55:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So just to get clear on our terms, the first pattern of burnout is super stressed in the morning, exhausted in the afternoon, evening and at night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6932" target="_blank">01:55:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Second pattern of burnout, stressed at night, exhausted in the morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6938" target="_blank">01:55:38.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You are now armed with the various tools to be able to correct either pattern of burnout.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6943" target="_blank">01:55:43.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're waking up with a ton of stress, maybe even a few hours before you should be waking up or want to wake up in order to get your full complement of sleep, you need to do something to try and bring down or to reduce the angle on that rising cortisol first thing in the morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6961" target="_blank">01:56:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Because almost certainly your cortisol is just rising too fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6965" target="_blank">01:56:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Remember, your cortisol is supposed to start rising a couple hours before you wake up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6969" target="_blank">01:56:09.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not supposed to be what we call a square weight function, like go from flat to vertical, okay?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6974" target="_blank">01:56:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's what you should do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6977" target="_blank">01:56:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're waking up with a ton of stress, you're not sleeping enough, I highly recommend that you use a practice I've talked about before in this podcast, which is non-sleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6988" target="_blank">01:56:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Some people call it yoga nidra.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6989" target="_blank">01:56:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I call it non-sleep deep rest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6991" target="_blank">01:56:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There are some differences between the two.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=6993" target="_blank">01:56:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not trying to take anything away from the practice of yoga nidra, but basically non-sleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, involves doing some long exhale breathing for reasons that you now know slows your heart rate down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7004" target="_blank">01:56:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It involves deliberately relaxing your body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7007" target="_blank">01:56:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It also involves you learning how to deliberately engage your parasympathetic nervous system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7013" target="_blank">01:56:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, some people will do NSDR or yoga nidra first thing in the morning when they wake up to avoid too much stress and they'll fall back asleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7021" target="_blank">01:57:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7023" target="_blank">01:57:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea with yoga nidra and NSDR is that you don't fall back asleep, that you stay awake, but you completely and progressively increase your relaxation in your body.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7032" target="_blank">01:57:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">However, if you fall back asleep, great, just make sure you set an alarm if you're going to do NSDR yoga nidra first thing in the morning so that you don't oversleep and miss a work appointment or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7043" target="_blank">01:57:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But there are great data now showing that NSDR and yoga nidra done regularly for durations of anywhere from 10 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7050" target="_blank">01:57:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, the study I'm going to be referring to in a moment actually used 11 minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7054" target="_blank">01:57:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so anywhere from 11 minutes to 30 minutes can significantly reduce cortisol levels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7060" target="_blank">01:57:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is good, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7061" target="_blank">01:57:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Even though we've been talking this whole episode about you want your cortisol high in the morning, we're referring to a pattern of burnout where your cortisol is rising too fast in the morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7069" target="_blank">01:57:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Doing NSDR can help adjust that slope so that it's not so steep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7073" target="_blank">01:57:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, if you're somebody who wakes up and feels anxiety right away, even if you don't think you have this pattern of burnout, I highly recommend doing a 10 minute or even a 20 minute or 30 minute NSDR.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7084"

different formats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7101" target="_blank">01:58:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And I also provide links to some of the ones that are read by other people whose NSDRs are very effective and that I personally use, such as Kelly Boyes and others who have recorded NSDRs of different durations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7112" target="_blank">01:58:32.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an extremely powerful tool for reducing your cortisol levels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7116" target="_blank">01:58:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But in addition to that, it's a very powerful tool for you to be able to self-direct your own activation of that parasympathetic nervous system to self-direct your own relaxation at a time when your system is by default driving you in the exact opposite direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7131" target="_blank">01:58:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're somebody suffering from this first type of burnout, I highly recommend you start implementing an NSDR practice, especially if you wake up in the middle of the night or you wake up really early in the morning and you can't sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7141" target="_blank">01:59:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So ideally you're doing NSDR right as you wake up in the morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7145" target="_blank">01:59:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Ideally you do it for 30 minutes, but most people probably won't have the time for that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7148" target="_blank">01:59:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe you do 20, maybe you do 10.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7149" target="_blank">01:59:09.660</a></span> | <span

11:00 p.m., but they're not able to do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7370" target="_blank">02:02:50.660</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7376" target="_blank">02:02:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then come nighttime, their levels of energy and certain mental ruminations and, you know, just their stress levels are just really high, even if they're exhausted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7387" target="_blank">02:03:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If this is you, you really need to start thinking about the six hours before you would like to fall asleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span

avoid doing in the evening, avoiding bright light, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7401" target="_blank">02:03:21.660</a></span> | <span class="t">By the way, if you are in the long days of summer and spring and the sun is going down and, you know, 7:30 or 8:30, that's fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7408" target="_blank">02:03:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, we now know that if you view sunlight late in the day, provided the sun is out, which is the only way you can view sunlight as far as I know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7415" target="_blank">02:03:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Viewing that sunlight will actually adjust the sensitivity of your retina a little bit, such that bright light from artificial sources won't have quite as much of a detrimental effect at suppressing melatonin at night when you're indoors under artificial lights.</span></div><div

means, if there's a beautiful sunset out, take a sunset walk, walk in the direction of the sun, look at the sunlight, blink as needed to protect your eyes, but see those beautiful sunsets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7440" target="_blank">02:04:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You'll notice that throughout

target="_blank">02:04:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I've given ranges because of course, day length changes across the year, especially if you're living closer to the poles.</span></div><div

burnout and it's 7:30 at night and the sun's still out, by all means, go for a nice relaxing walk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7460" target="_blank">02:04:20.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That's going to be part of your regimen for bringing down your levels of autonomic activation, for reducing your cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7465" target="_blank">02:04:25.660</a></span> | <span

class="t">And when you get indoors, by all means, do everything you can to dim the lights, to bring your levels of stress down, take five minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7480" target="_blank">02:04:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I know it sounds like a lot, but just five minutes and do a physiological sigh of the sort that I described before, double inhale, long exhale, and just repeat that for about three to five minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7490" target="_blank">02:04:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I ran a clinical trial with my colleague, David Spiegel at Stanford a few years ago, where we had people do that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7495" target="_blank">02:04:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we found is that not only calms them in those five minutes, not only reduces heart rate, increases heart rate variability, which is a signature, by the way, of self calming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7506" target="_blank">02:05:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It also improves sleep.</span></div><div

minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7510" target="_blank">02:05:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a very powerful tool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7512" target="_blank">02:05:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And again, five minutes is barely anything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7514" target="_blank">02:05:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you take that time, you're going to benefit from that, certainly in the time that you're doing it and in the hours after with the ease of being able to fall asleep, but also the next day.</span></div><div

burnout is about getting your nighttime cortisol low so that your morning cortisol levels can be elevated again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7534" target="_blank">02:05:34.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And that you can have that energy in the morning, which then sets in motion the proper overall cortisol rhythm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7540" target="_blank">02:05:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you're starting to sense a repeating theme, indeed, it's because your cortisol rhythm is repeating and you got that peak that ideally comes in the morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span

right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7552" target="_blank">02:05:52.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The peak is the

sort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7595" target="_blank">02:06:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so many times it seems that what's happened is this cortisol curve has just shifted too late or it's being spiked in the afternoon or it's being spiked at night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7605" target="_blank">02:06:45.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And yes, we could talk about all the reasons why with modern electronics and technology, you know, we're biasing ourselves towards these patterns of late shifted cortisol and disrupted cortisol rhythms.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7615" target="_blank">02:06:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But look, technology is not going anywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7618" target="_blank">02:06:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">What is here to stay is your ability to engage with those technologies and to do the proper things like exercise and eating, et cetera, and self calming at the appropriate times of your schedule so that you can get your cortisol rhythms back in check.</span></div><div

an outsized positive effect on everything mood, focus, alertness, sleep, which then of course feeds back on elevated mood, focus, alertness, and sleep.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7642" target="_blank">02:07:22.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The early part of your day, the middle of your day, and the end of your day and

cortisol rhythms?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7651" target="_blank">02:07:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">By grabbing a hold of the time of day in which they're most challenging and starting to do as many things as you possibly can to bring your cortisol up if that's what's needed early in the day or down, which is what's needed late in the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7664" target="_blank">02:07:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Wherever your main pain point is along the 24 hour day and night, that's where you should focus your efforts first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7671" target="_blank">02:07:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And from there, you can start making adjustments in the other protocols in order to get things exactly right for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7677" target="_blank">02:07:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's possible, but start where you're experiencing the most pain first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7681" target="_blank">02:08:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, so much of what we see out there in the discussions around health and challenges with health, whether or not it's chronic stress or whether or not it's challenges as we age in getting great sleep and having energy, if you look at the literature, it almost always comes back to cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7696" target="_blank">02:08:16.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe not as the only problem, but as a key role in those problems and a key path to fix them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7703" target="_blank">02:08:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, there's a beautiful paper that compared male and female differences in cortisol secretion patterns.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7708" target="_blank">02:08:28.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And they look pretty much similar up until about age 40.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7711" target="_blank">02:08:31.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Actually, what you find is that women have slightly lower basal levels of cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7715" target="_blank">02:08:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If you look at any one time point along the 24 hour rhythm up until about age 40.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7720" target="_blank">02:08:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Then what happens is as men and women get older from about 40 out to 70, they look across a pretty broad range of ages.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7727" target="_blank">02:08:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">What you find is that the morning peak in cortisol tends to come down a little bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7730" target="_blank">02:08:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In fact, the acrophage that peak tends to be a bit more rounded as opposed to peaked, which means that the drop in cortisol in the early afternoon and evening is actually more gradual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7740" target="_blank">02:09:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's flattening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7741" target="_blank">02:09:01.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And a flattening of the cortisol curve has been shown in other studies to actually predict lower lifespan, certainly in response to health challenges like cancer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7750" target="_blank">02:09:10.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's the good news.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7751" target="_blank">02:09:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Practices which adjust stress down in the afternoon in those people combating cancer actually predicted survivability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7757" target="_blank">02:09:17.660</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, the bigger the peak, the more rapid the decline in cortisol into the afternoon and the lower it stayed at night, the longer people lived and the more successful people were in overcoming diseases such as cancer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7770" target="_blank">02:09:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I'm not saying that's the only thing that allowed them to do that, but it makes perfect sense based on everything we know about the interactions between cortisol and the immune system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7777" target="_blank">02:09:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Between stress and survivability, between longevity, and between the production of all sorts of things that relate to glucose metabolism, dopamine, et cetera, and so on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7787" target="_blank">02:09:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Another interesting point is that as women transition from perimenopause to menopause, so of course this is correlated with aging, but the exact age that it occurs differs between women, but it's roughly between the ages of late 30s to early 50s, depending on the person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7803" target="_blank">02:10:03.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There's also a characteristic flattening out of the cortisol rhythm into the afternoon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7807" target="_blank">02:10:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the way it's described in the literature across all these different situations, menopause, aging, when people are combating a chronic illness and so forth, is this flattening of the afternoon cortisol curve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7818" target="_blank">02:10:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">What this speaks to, again, is the critical importance of high morning cortisol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7824" target="_blank">02:10:24.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to emphasize that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7825" target="_blank">02:10:25.660</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">02:10:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to get out and into your day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7831"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7833" target="_blank">02:10:33.660</a></span> | <span class="t">If it starts at 5:00, 6:00, 7:00, 8:00 AM, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span

enough sleep prior to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7839" target="_blank">02:10:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">For most people, it's going to be six to eight hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7841" target="_blank">02:10:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There are you rare ones out there that can get by on four to five hours, but the data really point to the fact that most people should get six to eight hours, maybe nine or maybe more if you're a kid and you're developing or you're combating an illness or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7854" target="_blank">02:10:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But six to eight hours, when you wake up, spike that cortisol using the tools we described.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7859" target="_blank">02:10:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Then make sure that cortisol doesn't come down far too fast, right?</span></div><div

steep drop and you want that cortisol coming down, down, down, down, down, down into the afternoon such that by late afternoon and evening, it's down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7878" target="_blank">02:11:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you want to keep it down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

<span class="t">And in fact, we didn't go into it today, but there is a vast literature that shows that if you get your cortisol rhythm, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7915" target="_blank">02:11:55.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It improves your cognition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7917" target="_blank">02:11:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There's also a vast literature showing that if your cortisol is disrupted in a way that your cortisol is too high in the afternoon, your cognition suffers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7925" target="_blank">02:12:05.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There's actually a known reason for this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7926" target="_blank">02:12:06.660</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't help but sneak this in, which is that your hippocampus, this brain area that's involved in learning and memory is chock-a-block full of cortisol receptors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7935" target="_blank">02:12:15.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And what happens is if your cortisol is elevated at the wrong times for too long, you actually get degeneration of these neurons in the hippocampus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7945" target="_blank">02:12:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a bad situation for two reasons.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7947" target="_blank">02:12:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">One, cognition and memory suffer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7949" target="_blank">02:12:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">The other reason is that the hippocampus itself is involved in contextual control over the cortisol cycle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7956" target="_blank">02:12:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Meaning the hippocampus is vital for you to be able to interpret when something is merely arousing, exciting versus stressful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7964" target="_blank">02:12:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And so as that structure degenerates, you can't remember as many things, which itself is stressful, but also your ability to regulate stress is reduced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7974" target="_blank">02:12:54.660</a></span> | <span class="t">There are literally hundreds of studies on this from animals and in humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU&t=7978" target="_blank">02:12:58.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So getting your cortisol

today in terms of protocols, whether or not they are behavioral, involving exercise, whether or not they're involving nutrition, whether or not they're involving supplementation.</span></div><div
