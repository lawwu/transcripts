href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=381sguwAS9c&t=1632">00:27:12.040</a></span> | <span class="t">How hard I have a kind of a technical question but which is just you had to when you picked a V you had to make a decision about small edits and not large edits I guess right</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=381sguwAS9c&t=1645">00:27:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So just explain to these guys about what payloads are actually possible in a V and are you thinking about what happens if you actually have to go beyond 4 KB and how are you going to solve that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=381sguwAS9c&t=1656">00:27:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a lot of the diseases that these guys will actually probably understand are not small snips they're going to be large you know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=381sguwAS9c&t=1663">00:27:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's two types of gene therapy there's gene transfer gene therapy where we give you the whole gene that you were missing like perhaps you were missing that portion of your chromosome at birth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=381sguwAS9c&t=1672">00:27:52.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's gene transfer gene therapy we're literally transferring a functional copy of the gene back to you and then there's gene editing gene therapy where we go in and actually correct a mutation in place within your genome and don't give you anything extra</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=381sguwAS9c&t=1684">00:28:04.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So every virus on the planet has a carrying capacity it has a size just like a sedan can't carry as much as a minivan</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=381sguwAS9c&t=1691">00:28:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so AAV viruses the viruses I work on are amongst one of the smaller viruses so it can only package about 4.75 KB so the numbers of nucleotides that you can fit inside of it and different viruses have larger packaging capacities and can fit more stuff</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=381sguwAS9c&t=1704">00:28:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">That's 4,700 letters of DNA</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=381sguwAS9c&t=1706">00:28:26.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so different viruses will have different packaging capacities and so if you're doing gene transfer gene therapy where you need to provide the entire copy of the gene you can only put in genes that will fit with all of the other regulatory elements for expression within that virus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=381sguwAS9c&t=1720">00:28:40.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So of all protein coding genes since we're typically going after diseases that are influencing a protein of all protein coding genes 80% of those genes can fit within my virus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=381sguwAS9c&t=1730">00:28:50.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So actually the vast majority of genetic diseases can be treated with AAV gene therapy with gene transfer gene therapy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=381sguwAS9c&t=1736">00:28:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">With gene editing gene therapy we can treat anything because now we're not size limited we only need to deliver either the knicker or the cutter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=381sguwAS9c&t=1742">00:29:02.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Many of you have heard of things like CRISPR that's one of the many tools we can use to nick or cut DNA</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=381sguwAS9c&t=1747">00:29:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can either make a nick and have your body repair the mutation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=381sguwAS9c&t=1751">00:29:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We can go in and make a nick or a cut and we can cut something out that wasn't supposed to be there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=381sguwAS9c&t=1757">00:29:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Or we can go in and nick or cut something in your genome cut something out and then put something that was meant to be there the whole time back in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=381sguwAS9c&t=1765">00:29:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So three of those forms those gene repairs and gene edits are all kind of broadly classified as gene editing gene therapy and all of those would fit within any virus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=381sguwAS9c&t=1773">00:29:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a high percentage of disease I don't know the percentage you probably know which is really
