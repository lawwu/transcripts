Like that's how I have my whole financial life set up. I kind of famously</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=17" target="_blank">00:00:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">say I spend 10 minutes a month on my finances and that's maybe a little bit of an exaggeration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=22" target="_blank">00:00:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">It's probably ever so slightly more than that, but not that much more, right? And I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=27" target="_blank">00:00:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you set everything on autopilot. For me, it's stress minimization. So that's how I kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">conceptualize my finance.

I'm looking to optimize for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">stress mitigation. Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=47" target="_blank">00:00:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">your life, money, and travel. I can't believe I'm saying this, but welcome to episode 100.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It seems so surreal that I've come this far, but it wouldn't be possible without your support.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=57" target="_blank">00:00:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So thank you so much. And for this week's episode, I wanted to try something different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea came up when I was talking to my good friend, Brad Barrett, who hosts the Choose FI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">podcast. And he was my guest for episode two on financial independence. We started having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a conversation about all the things we've learned the past few months and how we're applying them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to our lives. Things like focusing on what matters, optimizing towards net fulfillment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and a lot more. So instead of having that whole conversation on our own in private,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we paused and decided that we would do it with you. So without further ado, let's get into it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Brad, I am so excited we're doing this. Yeah, Chris, this should be fun. We always have a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of interesting conversations offline. So this should be a fun meandering little chat here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and I don't know if you knew this. So this is my episode 100, but I went back and looked,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and I know you weren't my episode one, but we actually recorded your episode two on All The</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Hacks. And we actually recorded that first. So my very first hit record on a podcast was with you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm very excited and thankful for you doing that. And it's kind of fun to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">celebrating 100 with you. Oh, that's so cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I am honored that I was the first guest and back for 100 here. Yeah, it's wild. I can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">believe you've been doing it that long. 100 episodes. So you're doing essentially one a week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I know a couple times you've had two a week. So we're coming up in what, almost 18 months</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to two years, somewhere in that vicinity? Yeah, it's been about 18 months. And I love</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">how Brad is saying this because if you haven't listened to Choose If I, his show, Brad's probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">done 600 episodes at this point. So I feel like I'm way, way, way behind. But yeah, I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">when I started, I wasn't sure if it was going to be 10 episodes and it just wasn't going to be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">good fit. So the idea that I've gone from side project to full-time job on podcasting, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm lucky to do that. I'm so thankful for everyone listening that has enabled me to do that. And I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.840</a></span> | <span class="t">just excited for the next 100. I hear you. And what's wild about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">podcasting is there's no downside essentially to trying it. And so yeah, we're coming up right on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">600. But when we started, it was just me and Jonathan sitting in a random office,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">spare office in Jonathan's house in Richmond, Virginia, talking into two microphones, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And it costs us essentially nothing to start. And we figured what the hell, right? Like, why,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">let's, let's experiment with this. And if it goes nowhere, no harm, no foul, in essence, right? Like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">nobody's ever going to hear it other than our parents. And if it goes somewhere, then who knows</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">what kind of impact it could have. So I mean, that's, it's pretty wild. So I mean, certainly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">podcasting is something that I never would have guessed in a million years would transform my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I was a corporate accountant. I did corporate state tax returns, which is as horrible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and mind numbing as, as you can imagine. And now I'm a financial independence podcaster with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.640</a></span> | <span class="t">60 million downloads. I mean, it's, it's crazy. And then to see your life transformed so dramatically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">since the first time I met you, which I guess was through the Playing With Fire documentary, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I went to the fire. I guess it's not technically a fire conference, but FinCon seems like it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty rooted in the financial independence movement for my startup. Because I was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, we're building software for financial planners and people who want to be better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">with finances. I should go to this conference." We met and it's been a great friendship. And really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of like how I think this episode came to be was we were just talking about things in life and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">catching up. And we're like, "We should record this." Like people would probably want to hear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.680</a></span> | <span class="t">what we're thinking about how last year went, what we're planning to do next year, what's going on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">with the fire movement, kind of all the things, health and data breaches, everything. So I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">excited to just kind of jump in and kind of go through what we go through. And if this does well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">people like it, obviously reach out to Brad and I, let us know, and we can make it a regular thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I would love to do this a couple of times a year. That's for damn sure. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, let's kick it off. So I mean, I guess the biggest thing in your world, I don't want to put</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">words in your mouth, but I mean, you're full-time now on this podcast and you left Wealthfront</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">fairly recently, right? Talk me through because that's not an easy decision no matter where you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">are in life. And now obviously, you have a degree of financial security that a lot of people don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">necessarily when they're making job transitions. But nevertheless, that's not an easy step.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm curious, how you thought through it? I am always a fan of the side hustle to full-time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">hustle path. So I started the podcast as a thing on the side. I kind of experimented with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">working with partners and then got it to a point where it was, I guess, big enough,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">financially stable enough that it was worth the risk. Is it financially stable enough that I would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.320</a></span> | <span class="t">make as much money as if I had a corporate job right now? Probably not. But do I see a path there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And can I make it work? Yes. And so that was really all I needed. I still love Wealthfront,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the product. I still love the team. In fact, the one thing that is sad about being a full-time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">creator is it's kind of lonely. So you build... You don't have that kind of water cooler team</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">experience that you do at a company. And so I do miss that. I still have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">text thread with all the Wealthfront people that I was close with. And we're talking almost every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">day. But I felt like it was an opportunity that if a friend asked me if they should take on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I was like, "Yes, you should." So I needed to do it myself. I need to kind of take my own advice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah. And you had a co-host for a long time. And now you're kind of running the show.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=402" target="_blank">00:06:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. It's hard to believe. Yeah. So Jonathan, I guess it was probably August of last year. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=409" target="_blank">00:06:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, we're coming five months and change, I guess. Yeah. He came to me and said, "I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=414" target="_blank">00:06:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to step back from the podcast." And it was definitely a surprise. And to everybody out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=421" target="_blank">00:07:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">there who... Because I got a ton of emails. I'm like, "Oh, what's going on? Is everything okay?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=426" target="_blank">00:07:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Everything's great. Jonathan and I are still great friends. In fact, I just came from a workout with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=430" target="_blank">00:07:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">him at the gym. We're working out together four days a week now. And he's doing stuff behind the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">scenes for Truths of Eyes. So we're still business partners. Everything's great. He's going to come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">back on the show every now and again. But yeah, man, it's been interesting. And you and I have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">talked a ton of times. Talked shop, actually, which is funny. Though I've been a podcaster,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=450" target="_blank">00:07:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I basically just have always showed up and recorded and that was it. And Jonathan kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=454" target="_blank">00:07:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">took care of everything. So yeah, when you're saying running the show, it's been a big change</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">for me, honestly. And I think what I've always been good at in terms of the podcast was sitting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">back and just listening critically and asking questions. And frankly, for me and my skillset,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that was pretty easy. It wasn't a heavy lift. I just listened and asked a couple of questions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">here and there. Hopefully incisive, interesting questions. But damn, now I've got to do Jonathan's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=487" target="_blank">00:08:07.040</a></span> | <span class="t">part and mine, which is Jonathan was always, hey, he was the engine behind the show, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason why I'm going into this and I'm curious of your process is it is not just 2x the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">work for me. Now, being the engine behind the show, the story arc, and then the questions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=505" target="_blank">00:08:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">there's some exponential factor, especially with my brain. When I get done with this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=511" target="_blank">00:08:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm fried, man. I mean, normally like on an interview, because you have to essentially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">bifurcate your brain of, okay, this side has to think about the story arc and moving it forward</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and making it interesting and logical and coming to a conclusion. But then the other side has to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">think of questions that are interesting and, oh, what would I want to ask if I were the podcast</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">listener? Because that's how I think of myself. And man, it is, like I said, it's exponentially</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">more difficult. But I mean, so far, I think it's going pretty well. I've been pretty happy with...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">It's been 20 plus episodes now. And yeah, it's so far so good. It's been a challenge. I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">going to lie. It's been a challenge, but it's been good. Yeah, I think people that are listening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">think, "Oh, yeah, podcasting. It's so great. You just hop on, have a conversation." But there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=559" target="_blank">00:09:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">lot of work behind the scenes. I spend a lot of time just trying to plan out what is the topics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And somebody emailed me and said, "Hey, it'd be great if you could work with more sponsors. I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">never heard of. And you could interview people that have never been on other shows." And it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "Yes." But finding those people, finding those companies to work with, there's just so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=578" target="_blank">00:09:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">much... It's definitely a full-time job. I didn't want to start another startup because I didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">want to have another 80-hour-a-week job. And my wife and I joke together. It's like, "Oh, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=587" target="_blank">00:09:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you did start a startup. You just didn't call it a startup." So it's definitely demanding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's great. You get a lot of flexibility. And people listening probably know that I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=597" target="_blank">00:09:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">been experimenting a lot with, "Okay, well, what if I just do some solo episodes? What if I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">talk about a country? What if I just do something different and don't necessarily</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">stick to only the interview regime?" So I'll push back. I mean, this is an example of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We're trying to... It's kind of an interview, but it's really more of a conversation. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been fun. That's been fun. And then I've been trying to make sure that it's not my only thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? We could talk about podcasting forever. But the average person listening here is probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "I don't have a podcast. I appreciate the background because it's interesting." But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we are able to use the topic of the people we talk to and the content we consume as research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">for the show as ways to think about other things in life. And so that's also been really a fun part</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of it, which is you do an episode with someone talking about health, and now you got to go deep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">on your own health. And now that's a big project. And I know that's one of the things we're both</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.200</a></span> | <span class="t">really thinking about this year. So I don't know. I thought maybe for this episode, it'd be fun to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">talk about some of the major things that have happened in the last month or two that have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">sparked missions or goals for what we want to do this coming year and talk about it openly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And hopefully, people find that interesting because I know that when I hear you talk about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">your side, I'm like, "Yes, please tell me." Taking notes, all that kind of good stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, certainly. Right back at you. And you know, I told you offline that a couple of your episodes,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">your most recent episodes have really, really significantly impacted me. And I mean, no joke,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I have listened to the Bill Perkins episode. I think it came out in December, mid-December.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And Dan Martell with Buy Back Your Time, listened to each of those twice already.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes it's fascinating. I consume a lot of podcasts, probably more than I should, frankly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But you never know when an idea is just going to hit you. And I think if I'm honest with myself,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=713" target="_blank">00:11:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the Bill Perkins die with zero concept would not have resonated with me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">two years ago, certainly five years ago, it would have fallen on deaf ears completely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And now when I heard him on, I read his book and really, really good book, certainly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=732" target="_blank">00:12:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but it didn't impact me as much as hearing him on your podcast. And then I heard him on Peter</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=737" target="_blank">00:12:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Tia's The Drive. And I think just the confluence of a couple of things. So like that, and like I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=743" target="_blank">00:12:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">said, the Dan Martell, Buying Back Your Time. And I had my buddy Dominic Cortuccio on our podcast,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">on Choose a Buy, episode 419, just a couple of weeks ago. And he was talking about your bold</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">move for 2023. So his kind of conceptual framework is he comes up with like one bold move that kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">of typifies that year. And he's been doing this now for, I think this is the ninth or 10th year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=769" target="_blank">00:12:49.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And it just sounded really cool to, A, have like an operating principle behind a year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=778" target="_blank">00:12:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">but also to be able to then look back on a decade of growth and fun and experience and say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, I was in that place when I did this bold move. And, you know, again, like I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the confluence of those three things have just like, I mean, without sounding hyperbolic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like just kind of like fried my brain in the best possible way. Like, and I think for a while, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm probably a little like neurotic and get inside my head. I have like, you know, prone to anxiety</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=809" target="_blank">00:13:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and such. And like, it was actually a little stressful, Chris. And I think when I spoke with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Dominic, I just didn't have an answer. And then in hearing Perkins and Martel, like, I think it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=827" target="_blank">00:13:47.040</a></span> | <span class="t">crystallized to me that I just need, I need to explore more. Like I need more fun in my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I am like, just trying, I guess, like what I actually hit on was my healthiest year ever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, that's my kind of operating principle for 2023. And like, I think what that means in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">practical terms is actually like kind of loosening the purse strings and not being like, I don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">consider myself like a frugal or cheap person anymore. Not that frugal and cheap are exactly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">synonymous. But, you know, I mean, obviously, you know, very well, the old school FI mindset</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">of watching every penny. And I think, I think both of us, frankly, have gotten a lot better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=871" target="_blank">00:14:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">with that. So I'll let you jump in now, because I know, I know this, like that last thing is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is like very impactful for you and how your mindset has changed just since I've met you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">honestly. Yeah, it's funny. When I first found the financial independence movement, I was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=889" target="_blank">00:14:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, this is great. This is how I've been living my life," which is like save every dollar possible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">find every hack there is to spend less on everything you want to do, whether it's house</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">hacking or travel hacking or anything, so that I could save as much as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, my original goal was to do that because I hadn't found a career that I loved. And I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "I can't work a job I don't love." So there was a real reason behind it. But I feel like I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=913" target="_blank">00:15:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">went to an extreme that was very hard to get out of once I realized, "Oh, I actually do like what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=918" target="_blank">00:15:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I do." And now it was very hard to do the most silly things like, "Oh, I'm at a restaurant and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">really want a miso soup." But miso soup is usually $3, and this place it's $6. And I'm like, "That</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">just seems egregious. I shouldn't get this miso." It's like, "All I want is a miso soup." And we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=937" target="_blank">00:15:37.120</a></span> | <span class="t">talking about $3. And I would get stressed out about it to the point that I wouldn't get the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">miso soup. And my wife had ended up acting similarly. So we'd both be sitting there like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"All we want is a miso soup, but for $6 between the two of us, we can't do it."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But we could if it was $3. It got to be a little crazy. And I hadn't been able to articulate and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">process those feelings. It's like something I'd been thinking about. And every one of my friends</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=962" target="_blank">00:16:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">is always like, "Dude..." I remember going to dinners where someone's like, "We'll buy a really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">expensive bottle of wine if you just put in $20." And I'm like, "Why would I put in $20? I'm only</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">getting a glass and there's a glass on the menu for $12." And they're like, "Come on, just spend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">$8." Everyone's just trying to get me to spend a little bit more. And when I sat down with Bill</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Perkins and we talked, I was like, "What is all of this money for?" That was one big component.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the other big component that I think I probably haven't talked a lot about is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">sometimes, spending your money is not a net negative. So for me, when I think about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">podcast, I'm like, "Oh, okay." I've never been in a circumstance where the business you work at or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1006" target="_blank">00:16:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">run, the expenses you create for it directly affect your income. When you work at a company,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">if you spend a little bit more of the company's money, yes, there's an indirect trickle-down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1016" target="_blank">00:16:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">effect of the company being less profitable and might affect you. But when you're owning your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1021" target="_blank">00:17:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">own business, if you spend all of the money the business makes, you don't have a salary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very different. And so as I think about the year ahead, there are opportunities to build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1031" target="_blank">00:17:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">cool products that everyone listening right now might benefit from, to save money on travel,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1036" target="_blank">00:17:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to get cool deals. I have all these ideas. But to go spend the time and energy to do that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I either need to hire people or invest more time or get an assistant or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And I struggle with that, even though I know that it's a good investment. I'm gonna invest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">money in my own business. So I'm trying to get better at it. And I don't have a bold move for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1057" target="_blank">00:17:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the year. But if I did, it would be value my time or invest in myself. Maybe it's invest in myself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.320</a></span> | <span class="t">But I don't know. I feel like that might be too broad because you'd be like, "Well, is it your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">health? Is it your time?" And then you could just... It's hard. And I think if there's anything I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">learned from running companies, you can't have a bunch of goals. You need a single theme that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1078" target="_blank">00:17:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">everything falls under. Otherwise, you just have this endless to-do list and you don't know how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">to prioritize. Yeah, I hear you. And like you said, "Oh, I could build out this thing to help</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">people with travel rewards." And it may be a good investment. But I think one of the operating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">principles that I operate under is actually this question that I ask myself is, "What are you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1098" target="_blank">00:18:18.800</a></span> | <span class="t">optimizing for?" And I think it's just really impactful just to ask yourself that. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.080</a></span> | <span class="t">literally ask myself that quite often. "What in this situation are you optimizing for?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And I mean, from my daughter and what high school she's going to go to is, "Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">what are you optimizing for?"

And the question to ask yourself is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1140" target="_blank">00:19:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">really, what are you optimizing for? What would growth mean to you? In your case, is it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm not necessarily looking for an answer, it's mostly rhetorical, but is it money? Is it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">impact? Is it building something new the world hasn't seen that only Chris Hutchens and his</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1158" target="_blank">00:19:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">inimitable style with hacks can put together? Is it some alchemy of all three of those things or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1165" target="_blank">00:19:25.760</a></span> | <span class="t">something that I didn't listen? I think it's really important to ask that from the outset,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">because you might get down a road where, "Hey, this is a good investment. This is going to have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">impact. But damn, if it isn't going to take up 40 hours a week out of my 168, is that worth it?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1184" target="_blank">00:19:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And I like to sleep.

Sam Parr posted this thing on Twitter where he's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1281" target="_blank">00:21:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "Would you rather earn 8% guaranteed forever?"

But</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1306" target="_blank">00:21:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">for me, it's like, "This year, I'm not trying to turn the dials on my investments.

Yeah, focus on life is the critical part. And yeah, like you said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it is this funny paradox that for people like us who have always been attuned to our money,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">really probably our financial lives are the easiest part of our entire lives</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1329" target="_blank">00:22:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's on autopilot.

And you set everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1347" target="_blank">00:22:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">on autopay, autopilot. For me, it's stress minimization. So that's how I conceptualize</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">my finance.

So I never want to have to think about the timing of anything. So all of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1382" target="_blank">00:23:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">transfers happen pretty much on autopilot, except for a couple of random, HSA, I max out on January</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1390" target="_blank">00:23:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">1st of every year, but I have a little task in Todoist, which is my task manager, and it's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">max out HSA. And then I never have to think about it again. But anyway, so wanted to touch on that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1401" target="_blank">00:23:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">for sure. But yeah, this thread from Sam was so interesting, and it's especially fascinating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So Sam Parr is one of the co-hosts of the My First Million podcast, which both you and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.560</a></span> | <span class="t">thoroughly enjoy. And interestingly enough, Sean Puri is his co-host. And he basically said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.520</a></span> | <span class="t">"I asked Sean and a few others this question.

This baffles me.'" And I actually wrote back to this, which Sean wrote back to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and I don't think was altogether thrilled, but I said, "Baffling and just silly.

Find your fun in real life." And I think that last part was especially the point</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1463" target="_blank">00:24:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that I wanted to make, is for most people, a lot of these people on this thread were basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1470" target="_blank">00:24:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">saying like, "Oh, but I learn so much. I get fun out of this." I mean, my argument is there's so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1476" target="_blank">00:24:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">many other ways to actually have fun in life. And Sam's actual original post said, "You can still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1482" target="_blank">00:24:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">build your own startups. It's just, you can't invest in this wacky stuff." And I think for me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1489" target="_blank">00:24:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I look at life through the lens of a poker player and what increases my odds of success long-term.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1498" target="_blank">00:24:58.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like the aggregation of marginal gains, right? 1% differences might not make a difference</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in the short term, but over a lifetime, if you make the right decision over and over and over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1509" target="_blank">00:25:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">again, thousands of times, it's going to have an effect.

And there is no world where I would do that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1750" target="_blank">00:29:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">on my own. So I mean, I haven't done analysis, certainly, of is the benefit that I'm getting,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1757" target="_blank">00:29:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">does it outweigh the fees? I suspect that it does. But in all candor, I haven't. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1763" target="_blank">00:29:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">sure, you have that information committed to memory in general.

Obviously, nobody cried for me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1812" target="_blank">00:30:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm doing fine. I've reached financial independence. It's not at the end of the day,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1816" target="_blank">00:30:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it's fine. But I know in my heart of hearts, I probably made suboptimal decisions based on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1821" target="_blank">00:30:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">emotion. And I think, you know, when we talked about, hey, like, the actual nuts and bolts of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1827" target="_blank">00:30:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">money is the easy part. I stand with that. And I hold to that, certainly. But because I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1834" target="_blank">00:30:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it's precisely the psychological part, that's the really the hard part. And you let your brain get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1839" target="_blank">00:30:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">involved. And it just kind of does stupid crap. I've always noticed that the financial independence</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1844" target="_blank">00:30:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">community, and myself included, always hate fees. Like it just is one of those things that people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1849" target="_blank">00:30:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">just hate paying fees. And so I know that that's been a lot of the aversion to, you know, an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1855" target="_blank">00:30:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">investment advisor, a financial advisor, a robo advisor, any of those things. And what really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1859" target="_blank">00:30:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">changed it for me one time was, I had created this portfolio that was like eight index funds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was going through trying the process of rebalancing and managing it and all that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1869" target="_blank">00:31:09.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And I remember at one point, I was like, what trades do I have to make? I have to sell these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1872" target="_blank">00:31:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">three to rebalance. And it was just like, I actually wasn't sure if I could make the trades.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1876" target="_blank">00:31:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I was like, well, I don't know if these trades are gonna have to clear before I can rebuy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1880" target="_blank">00:31:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I just kept pausing, pausing, pausing. And I watched the market move. And I was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1884" target="_blank">00:31:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">what am I doing? I don't think that doing this full time is a priority enough that I'm doing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1889" target="_blank">00:31:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I have to do it. I have to offload it. The added benefit was that things like direct indexing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1894" target="_blank">00:31:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">when you can start to break apart the index fund and actually say, "Well, instead of investing in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1898" target="_blank">00:31:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the S&P 500 or Vanguard at VTI or VTSAX, you just buy all the individual things."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1903" target="_blank">00:31:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, obviously, that's completely untenable for a person to do and go buy hundreds and hundreds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1908" target="_blank">00:31:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">of stocks. But there are some advantages there when it comes to being able to tax loss harvest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1912" target="_blank">00:31:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">with 100, or 1000, or 500, whatever number of stocks. So we could go down here quite a bit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1918" target="_blank">00:31:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I will attempt to pull back and stay on the money theme and just think, "Okay, so we're talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1924" target="_blank">00:32:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">about money. We've identified not focus on that side of money, but what are we focused on? And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1931" target="_blank">00:32:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">how do we spend it?" Are there things that you think next year, you're going to spend more time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1935" target="_blank">00:32:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">thinking on when it comes to money, or how you spend it? Yeah, without a doubt. And like I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1941" target="_blank">00:32:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">your podcast has helped inform a lot of this. And I think for me, it's experiences and health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1950" target="_blank">00:32:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So those are the two things that at this point, I am prioritizing. And I think what that's going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1957" target="_blank">00:32:37.040</a></span> | <span class="t">to mean in reality is spending money. And that's perfectly okay. And I think Brad circa five years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1964" target="_blank">00:32:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">ago would not have been okay with that. And I am now. And I think that's perfectly fine. And I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1968" target="_blank">00:32:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">frankly, very happy about it. So I'm curious if there's things that you're like this year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1972" target="_blank">00:32:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">this is what I want to spend on. So you and I are both</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1975" target="_blank">00:32:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">lovers of Japan. And I desperately want to get back to Japan. And I want to climb Mount Fuji.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1985" target="_blank">00:33:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">That is like an absolute goal of mine. Will that happen in 2023? I don't know.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1992" target="_blank">00:33:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Sophomore year of college over the summer, lived with a host family in a city called Hamamatsu.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=1999" target="_blank">00:33:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And it was a couple hours south of Tokyo and the Shinkansen. And like, the only time that I saw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2007" target="_blank">00:33:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Mount Fuji was on the bullet train. And it just like appeared. And obviously, you know how majestic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2014" target="_blank">00:33:34.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it is. And then it was like, it was the cloudy season. And unfortunately, I only got like a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2020" target="_blank">00:33:40.800</a></span> | <span class="t">couple little quick glimpses of it. I'm like, damn, I will be back there someday. And I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2025" target="_blank">00:33:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">at this point, it's going on 20, 20 plus years. So I have not been so great with the follow through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2032" target="_blank">00:33:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">on that. But my daughter, so my older daughter is now a roller coaster enthusiast, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2039" target="_blank">00:33:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">actually a thing like that is an actual term roller coaster enthusiast. There's like, like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2044" target="_blank">00:34:04.880</a></span> | <span class="t">little, well, not little, there are like massive organizations of these roller coaster enthusiasts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2049" target="_blank">00:34:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">throughout the world. And in the town, immediately adjacent to Mount Fuji is one of Japan's best</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2058" target="_blank">00:34:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">roller coasters. So I'm using this as like my little, my little hook to get my family there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2062" target="_blank">00:34:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So because, and I don't know about you, and I'd be curious to hear your thoughts, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2068" target="_blank">00:34:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you now have two kids. And I have two, I guess my kids are older at this point, which is kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2074" target="_blank">00:34:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">crazy to say, but it's still hard to travel. And we have not been as good at that as, as I wish</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2080" target="_blank">00:34:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that we were, frankly. So the very long, the very short answer to your question is, yeah, I just,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2087" target="_blank">00:34:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I need to get back to Japan. I want to show my family, my wife, just that amazing culture.

So that's, that's the hope on like one of the big adventures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2099" target="_blank">00:34:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So if you're listening to this and you haven't been to Japan, you absolutely have to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2103" target="_blank">00:35:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Next week, I have an episode that's entirely devoted to Japan.

But it is like, the goal was to be a masterclass in planning a trip</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2129" target="_blank">00:35:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">to Japan. Overview of the culture, the people, the travel, the transit, Tokyo, Kyoto, other places to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2134" target="_blank">00:35:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">go, some hotspots that he loves, some unknown little corner places. So if Japan is anything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2140" target="_blank">00:35:40.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you've ever even considered, you should listen. And I'm going to try to fit into this incredibly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2145" target="_blank">00:35:45.440</a></span> | <span class="t">long episode at the end, a little thing about like, how do you use your points and miles to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2149" target="_blank">00:35:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">get there?

How do you make it an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">affordable trip?

So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2161" target="_blank">00:36:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">yes, Japan should be on everyone's list.

So yeah, the next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2473" target="_blank">00:41:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">time we do this, hopefully I'll have an update for you.

So anyway, long story short is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2501" target="_blank">00:41:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to, I'm going to see how this rolls. So I don't know, what do you think? Like I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2507" target="_blank">00:41:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you used to do one of these a month and obviously with COVID and the world shutting down and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2512" target="_blank">00:41:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">having kids, how has that changed and how are you looking at it now?

So I think what that allows you to do is make time for whatever that thing is, whether</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2525" target="_blank">00:42:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">it's something you want to learn, whether it's something you want to do.

But another one, since we had so many topics on this list, we're not going to get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2646" target="_blank">00:44:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to all of them based on our process. But when it comes to mine on valuing time, which I think is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2653" target="_blank">00:44:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">a big one for me, I want to share some of the things I've done and some of the things I'm going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2657" target="_blank">00:44:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">to do. I think that one thing that's really unfortunate... I remember sharing an app to a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2662" target="_blank">00:44:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">friend of mine and saying, "Oh, this is a great app. Paprika. It's a food app, right? And it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2668" target="_blank">00:44:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">recipe management, meal planning, all this stuff." And they're like, "Oh, it's expensive. It costs,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2672" target="_blank">00:44:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know, $5, $10, $20." I was like, "Okay." But we've kind of trained ourselves to assume,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2678" target="_blank">00:44:38.160</a></span> | <span class="t">"Oh, software should all be free. Content should all be free and all that stuff." Which is fair,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2682" target="_blank">00:44:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because it's not like we've been trained. It's not like we just decided this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2686" target="_blank">00:44:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And I have a similar problem. I'm like, "Do I want to buy an app for $20? This is crazy. Most</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2691" target="_blank">00:44:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">apps are free." But then I'm trying to equate things to "How much is this going to make my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2696" target="_blank">00:44:56.560</a></span> | <span class="t">life easier?" And of course, $20 is a good amount. So there are a bunch of products that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2700" target="_blank">00:45:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">some of which I've partnered with, some I haven't, because I'm just such a big fan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2705" target="_blank">00:45:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So Paprika is one. It costs money. And I love it. It saves me so much time. We meal plan on it. We</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2711" target="_blank">00:45:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">grocery shop on it. I think it's great. Partners of ours, Delete Me, is this site that I think is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2719" target="_blank">00:45:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">an incredible product that will basically go and remove all your data off the internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2723" target="_blank">00:45:23.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So I went pretty deep last year on cybersecurity and how do I get my data off? How do I make sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2728" target="_blank">00:45:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm protected? I did a whole two-part episode series where I interviewed someone and then did</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2733" target="_blank">00:45:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a ton of research and published it. So you can go back and listen to those. But that was one where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2738" target="_blank">00:45:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually started and I was like, "You know what? I don't know if I want to pay for a service that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2743" target="_blank">00:45:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">going to go delete all my information off the internet. I could just go to every individual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2746" target="_blank">00:45:46.560</a></span> | <span class="t">data broker website and do it. Why would I pay for someone to do this for me?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2751" target="_blank">00:45:51.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I started doing it. And one, I found that I spent 5 or 10 hours and I wasn't finished.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2756" target="_blank">00:45:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was like, "This is crazy. I do not value my time." And then two, after I did it manually,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2761" target="_blank">00:46:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I was like, "You know what? Let's at least see if I got it all." And I didn't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2764" target="_blank">00:46:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So I spent all these hours trying to do it. And then I realized not only could I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2768" target="_blank">00:46:08.320</a></span> | <span class="t">pay someone to save me time, but I could pay someone to do it better than me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2771" target="_blank">00:46:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was an interesting one and a product I love.

It's not a big deal. It's just because I already love it, I might as well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2786" target="_blank">00:46:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">put the link in on the website.

Because I'm using that time to be creative with my business,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2869" target="_blank">00:47:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">which hopefully will generate revenue in the future.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2871" target="_blank">00:47:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm using this time to spend with my kids, which I want to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2874" target="_blank">00:47:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's been a really hard thing for me.

But like you said, it almost invariably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2920" target="_blank">00:48:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">takes way longer than you anticipate.

So I, for years, my wife had this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2945" target="_blank">00:49:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">we have, I guess at chooseavai.com/meals, we have a PDF of like 30 recipes that she's curated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2952" target="_blank">00:49:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">They're not like her recipes.

And that's been fantastic. And we meal plan and we save time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2969" target="_blank">00:49:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">we save money, et cetera. But it's still a lot of hours. And not to mention on the front side,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2975" target="_blank">00:49:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">but on the backside too, like you don't think about this, the cleanup, right? Like if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2979" target="_blank">00:49:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">cleaning up pans every single time and putting all the dishes away, it's like, it's 20 plus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2986" target="_blank">00:49:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">minutes for each of us. That's 40 person minutes, right? And then when you think about that times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2992" target="_blank">00:49:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">seven or times how many of our meals per week, it's just an absurd amount of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=2997" target="_blank">00:49:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So I guess where I'm going with that is it's, I think we've been much more cognizant of our time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3005" target="_blank">00:50:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">recently.

And they cook it for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3022" target="_blank">00:50:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We get a whole...

And she's been doing that for a long</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3071" target="_blank">00:51:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">time.

And this is fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3082" target="_blank">00:51:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a lot of fun, frankly, to like try new food every week. And we don't have nearly as much,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3087" target="_blank">00:51:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously on the front side, but on the backside also, they give you the pans to cook these things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3094" target="_blank">00:51:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in. You don't have, there's no cleanup. So it's just, well, damn, would I pay $3 extra a meal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3099" target="_blank">00:51:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to not have to waste an hour of prep time and cleanup time? Of course I would. A hundred times</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3105" target="_blank">00:51:45.360</a></span> | <span class="t">out of a hundred. And the food frankly is as good or better and it's different every week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3109" target="_blank">00:51:49.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, I mean that like, you know, we actually just recently hired someone to clean the house</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3115" target="_blank">00:51:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">once a month and that's been great.

I think it's just more like, I need to conceptualize what, like, what does that actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3136" target="_blank">00:52:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">look like? I can't, I can't get from here to there. And like, how are you thinking about that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3140" target="_blank">00:52:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I did this episode with Dan Martell that you already referenced about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3143" target="_blank">00:52:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, buying back your time.

I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3148" target="_blank">00:52:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">like, you don't spend one second of your day on something that isn't a good use of your time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3153" target="_blank">00:52:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not sure I have the roadmap on how to exactly get there.

But I'm working on it. You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3164" target="_blank">00:52:44.080</a></span> | <span class="t">like we experimented with hiring someone to drop off meals and do the preparation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3168" target="_blank">00:52:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We're trying to, you know, we kind of go out or do carry out a couple nights a week just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3171" target="_blank">00:52:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to give ourselves a break.

But, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3187" target="_blank">00:53:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">for the interest of time, are there any other money things you're thinking about going forward?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3193" target="_blank">00:53:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. I mean, money things. I am kind of at a crossroads with my real estate investing. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3200" target="_blank">00:53:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, a bunch of our listeners have asked for an update with this is I went up buying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3205" target="_blank">00:53:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and I don't know if I ever told you this, but two single family rental properties down in Georgia</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3211" target="_blank">00:53:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">a couple of years ago, it's probably three or four years ago at this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3214" target="_blank">00:53:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've never liked real estate. Like it just, I don't know, it kind of scares me. I had a bad</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3220" target="_blank">00:53:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">experience of like kind of speculation back in my twenties. And like, it just scarred me for life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3226" target="_blank">00:53:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think I've gotten over it to a large degree in terms of like, okay, idiot, don't look at this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3230" target="_blank">00:53:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">as like, you're going to make a quick buck. This is going to go up, like look at it as a business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3235" target="_blank">00:53:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I'm a CPA. I should be looking at this as a business. And does it have cash flow? Is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3240" target="_blank">00:54:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">there a positive net income? And what's the return on investment? So, that's how, so I actually bought</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3246" target="_blank">00:54:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">both these properties in cash. And they've been great. I mean, they've returned phenomenally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3253" target="_blank">00:54:13.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like the bigger pockets, 1% rule. Now, obviously for anybody in the Bay Area, or like this is for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3258" target="_blank">00:54:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">your own personal residence, this is laughable. But for an investment property in rural Georgia,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3264" target="_blank">00:54:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">or in Alabama, or in many places throughout the country, you can find it's like 1% of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3271" target="_blank">00:54:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">purchase price as the monthly rent. So, now for instance, I bought these properties after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3277" target="_blank">00:54:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">renovation. I bought them for basically $55,000 a piece. So, 1% of that would be $550 a month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3284" target="_blank">00:54:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that would be then like a 12% gross return per year. But actually, Chris, I rent them for like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3291" target="_blank">00:54:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">750 and 800 a month. So, it's like 1.5%, which is phenomenal. And so far, and it's a small sample</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3299" target="_blank">00:54:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">size, obviously, but I haven't been hit with any major, major extraordinary expenses. Obviously,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3304" target="_blank">00:55:04.400</a></span> | <span class="t">there's always stuff that comes up as a homeowner or a landlord, but they've returned phenomenally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3310" target="_blank">00:55:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And then that brings the question, okay, yeah, I kind of don't love real estate,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3315" target="_blank">00:55:15.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but these have been like an unmitigated success. And then I had somebody, I had Alan Corey on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3322" target="_blank">00:55:22.480</a></span> | <span class="t">podcast a couple of weeks ago, talking about, "Hey, maybe that sounds great. But do you consider</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3328" target="_blank">00:55:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">what would that have looked like if you had bought eight of these with 25% down instead of two with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3335" target="_blank">00:55:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">100% cash in essence?" And so, yeah, I mean... What about those index funds? Those index funds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3341" target="_blank">00:55:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">they're so easy. There's no overhead. Index funds are so easy. And that's the constant</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3347" target="_blank">00:55:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">tension in my life, is I just want simplicity.

But...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3355" target="_blank">00:55:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Chasing those returns. Yeah, those returns. And right? I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3359" target="_blank">00:55:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that's what it comes down to. You can know intellectually, but damn, those returns are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3363" target="_blank">00:56:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">great, right? And like, is that a small sample size? Is this replicable? Am I going to not sleep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3369" target="_blank">00:56:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">as well at night if I have a mortgage on something? So yeah, these are all kind of rolling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3374" target="_blank">00:56:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">around in my head. Or what are your time-adjusted returns? Because I promise you that buying that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3380" target="_blank">00:56:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">rental property and managing that rental property has a cost of time that is greater than how long</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3385" target="_blank">00:56:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it took you to buy VTI or VTSX or whatever index fund. And I don't know if there's an easy way to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3391" target="_blank">00:56:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">factor that in. But I don't know. For me, the only real estate that we have other than our primary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3397" target="_blank">00:56:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">residence is a fractional home that we own, that we stay in. And that's it. We're not trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3404" target="_blank">00:56:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">rent it out. We're not trying to make money. It's just a good way for us to be able to have another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3409" target="_blank">00:56:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">place to go to. But I don't know. I've always struggled with this. I did this episode with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3413" target="_blank">00:56:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Brandon Turner and he has all these... A real estate empire and has amassed a net worth far</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3420" target="_blank">00:57:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">greater than both of us combined through real estate. But every time I think about it, I'm just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3425" target="_blank">00:57:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "I don't know if I want to play the game." It's just not... It doesn't excite me. Being a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3429" target="_blank">00:57:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">landlord is not fun for me in any scalable thing.

Being a one-off landlord and taking on that kind of little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3448" target="_blank">00:57:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">work is not too much. But actually turning it into a profession and doing it, it's for a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3454" target="_blank">00:57:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of people. And I think a lot of people do really well with it. My brother and sister-in-law,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3458" target="_blank">00:57:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">they've bought up a bunch of auto repair and tire shops. There are a lot of businesses that you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3463" target="_blank">00:57:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">own. And they can be very, very successful. And you could do well with them. That's just not what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3468" target="_blank">00:57:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to do. But they've done a great job. And it's funny how real estate seems like the obvious</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3475" target="_blank">00:57:55.440</a></span> | <span class="t">alternative of what to do with your money. But then you listen to someone like Cody Sanchez,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3480" target="_blank">00:58:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">who's going to be coming on the podcast soon.

So there's lots of ways you can buy businesses,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3488" target="_blank">00:58:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">one of which is a rental property.

And frankly, you don't hear about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3536" target="_blank">00:58:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">all the people that got wrecked by leverage and just made stupid decisions. So I think there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3541" target="_blank">00:59:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">some aspect of that, certainly.

And let's be perfectly honest with ourselves. But without leverage, even that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3559" target="_blank">00:59:19.520</a></span> | <span class="t">1% rule, right?

No, not in a million years. In the Bay Area, that's for damn sure. And I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3576" target="_blank">00:59:36.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that's a 12% gross return.

So okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3590" target="_blank">00:59:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">your 12% gross return turns into a 6% net return. 6%.

So we're still back at 7%, 8%, 9%, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3616" target="_blank">01:00:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty analogous to what we anticipate in the stock market. And like you said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3620" target="_blank">01:00:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a whole hell of a lot easier to buy VTI or VTSAX than it is to run a real estate rental</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3627" target="_blank">01:00:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">company, if you will, or whatever you want to conceptualize it as.

I think that's important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3674" target="_blank">01:01:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So the only other money thing I had was that we have an au pair from Italy.

So keep an ear out for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3700" target="_blank">01:01:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I would just say it's amazing that every few years, different insurance companies completely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3706" target="_blank">01:01:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">change the way they price different things. And I've consistently in my life found that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3711" target="_blank">01:01:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">every couple years, I just send all...

So that's my little fun thing for 2023 is if you haven't repriced your insurance in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3753" target="_blank">01:02:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">little while, and especially if you got your home or your rental, you've got your car, maybe you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3758" target="_blank">01:02:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">got an umbrella policy, you start to add all the things up, it could be worth shopping around and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3763" target="_blank">01:02:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">get a deal. Yeah. I think there are a lot of these little one-time-a-year things that you should do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3769" target="_blank">01:02:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that a lot of us don't do, frankly. But at least to be mindful of it, like I said, throw it in some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3774" target="_blank">01:02:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">task list that you have come up in mid-January.

So I think one-time-a-year price insurance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3789" target="_blank">01:03:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">one-time-a-year, hopefully at minimum, but certainly one-time-a-year, go through your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3793" target="_blank">01:03:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">credit card bill. Just line by line, are there any recurring things that you just forgot about?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3799" target="_blank">01:03:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">This happened to me a couple times with random Peacock or Hulu or some kind of Paramount Plus</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3805" target="_blank">01:03:25.840</a></span> | <span class="t">or some such. And like, "Oh, I wanted to watch Top Gun Maverick. So I got Paramount Plus. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3810" target="_blank">01:03:30.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm probably going to be paying for that for a couple months because I'm stupid and I didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3815" target="_blank">01:03:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">cancel it." So you should do that a couple times a year. RocketMoney is so good at this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3823" target="_blank">01:03:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a free app. They'll sync all of your... You sync your cards, and then they scan for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3829" target="_blank">01:03:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">things that are recurring. And then they just give you like an easy view of "Here are your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3832" target="_blank">01:03:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">recurring subscriptions." Now, their business model is "Okay, is there a recurring subscription?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3838" target="_blank">01:03:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">You can go cancel it." Or you could just tap one button and be like, "Go cancel it for me."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3842" target="_blank">01:04:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And you need their premium subscription to do that. But then they'll go reach out to whatever</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3847" target="_blank">01:04:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">company it is and just cancel it for you. And depending on the state you live in... In California,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3852" target="_blank">01:04:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it's nice that brands or companies are required to let you opt out online.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3856" target="_blank">01:04:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you have a New York Times subscription, and you don't live in California, it's so hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3859" target="_blank">01:04:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to cancel.

But when you do reprice your insurance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3881" target="_blank">01:04:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">make sure you actually look at how many miles you drive on your car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3886" target="_blank">01:04:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So we don't drive that much. And so one of our car policies is priced at 5,000 miles a year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3891" target="_blank">01:04:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">one's at 3,000. But if you don't tell your insurance company, they price it at 10,000 or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3895" target="_blank">01:04:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">12,000 a year.

I'm sure you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3942" target="_blank">01:05:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">have knowing you, you have some, uh, some better answer than to do this.

So if a task comes up, even down to like, I just renewed global entry. Okay. And I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3966" target="_blank">01:06:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">literally the next time I have to renew is 2027. So I just quite literally put the task in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=3973" target="_blank">01:06:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it comes to July of 2027 for February, 2027.

And, but again, like I said, you have to be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4028" target="_blank">01:07:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">hundred percent compliant with it because if you're not, then you'll always have that nagging</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4032" target="_blank">01:07:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">doubt that, oh, is it really in there? Can I really trust this? But when you can trust in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4037" target="_blank">01:07:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">hundred percent, you're golden.

I do use this app called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4042" target="_blank">01:07:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Trustworthy, which I'll call like the family operating system, where you can basically store</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4048" target="_blank">01:07:28.160</a></span> | <span class="t">all of your IDs, your vaccination cards, your passports, your tax returns. It's like a secure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4054" target="_blank">01:07:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">organized repository, right? You could have a Dropbox folder and put all this there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4058" target="_blank">01:07:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's not as organized. This has an app. So when I'm at the doctor's office and they're like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4065" target="_blank">01:07:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">"Can we reconfirm your daughter's insurance?"

Sister-in-law, it's like if something were to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4082" target="_blank">01:08:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">happen to you, let these people through some verification have access to all of our stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4087" target="_blank">01:08:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So we just store all of our stuff there. And it actually has a feature like this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4092" target="_blank">01:08:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You upload your passport or your driver's license, and you put in the expiration date,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4098" target="_blank">01:08:18.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and then they remind you, "Hey, your driver's license expires in 6 months." So it's a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4102" target="_blank">01:08:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">bit different in that it's not in one central repository. But for a lot of those expiring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4107" target="_blank">01:08:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">things, I have that in there. But I do think that I need to... I have not found a task management</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4112" target="_blank">01:08:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">solution that I love. So I got to work on that. But we are well on our way to filling an episode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4122" target="_blank">01:08:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And we had a whole topic of health. Do we want to jump into that? Do we want to do that again</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4127" target="_blank">01:08:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the next time? What do you think? Maybe we give a quick overview because I suspect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4131" target="_blank">01:08:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">like we said, with a lot of this stuff, we're both... We're at the beginning of the year here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4137" target="_blank">01:08:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We're both exploring. And I think what could be cool is for there to be some accountability to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4143" target="_blank">01:09:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the audience of, "Hey, we're going to actually follow through on this." Because I think that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4147" target="_blank">01:09:07.200</a></span> | <span class="t">what we tell our audience all the time is, "It's great to take in information. And that's all well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4151" target="_blank">01:09:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and good. But if you don't take action, it's all worthless. So you have to get up off the couch and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4157" target="_blank">01:09:17.600</a></span> | <span class="t">take action." And I think also, frankly, I fall down on this a lot. There are probably dozens of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4166" target="_blank">01:09:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">things that I promised over the years that, "Oh, I'm going to do this. And I don't follow up because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4170" target="_blank">01:09:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">there's no accountability." So it would be pretty cool, maybe on some level, for us to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4174" target="_blank">01:09:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">accountability partners. And then by extension, the audience to some degree. I don't know if I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4180" target="_blank">01:09:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">have a... I don't have a prepared list of things I want you and the audience to hold me accountable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4185" target="_blank">01:09:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">for when it comes to some of these things. But I know you have a few on health. Why don't we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4192" target="_blank">01:09:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">set the stage for this at a high level and say, "Look, health is a big thing for us. We want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4197" target="_blank">01:09:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">spend some time focused on it." If this is interesting as an episode, definitely reach</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4202" target="_blank">01:10:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">out to Brad and I. If you're listening to all the hacks, reach out to me. If you're listening to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4205" target="_blank">01:10:05.440</a></span> | <span class="t">reach out to both of us, it doesn't matter. But let us know so we know. Should we keep this up?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4209" target="_blank">01:10:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Should we keep doing this? You don't have to send a long email. You can send Chris at all the hacks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4213" target="_blank">01:10:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and say, "Do Brad again." I'd rather get the feedback than get this really nice response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4220" target="_blank">01:10:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">So whether it's on social or email or whatever format you like, I'd love to know what people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4226" target="_blank">01:10:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">think of this. And so we can come back and finish this whole health thing. What do you think?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4230" target="_blank">01:10:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that's great. That's a great idea. And yeah, same for either your audience or mine,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4236" target="_blank">01:10:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">feedback@chooseavi.com or just get on my newsletter at chooseavi.com/subscribe.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4241" target="_blank">01:10:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you hit reply, it literally comes to me.

And I think we kind of conceptualize this as,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4252" target="_blank">01:10:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like you said, a conversation, just kind of a random show of, "Hey,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4256" target="_blank">01:10:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">what's going on in our lives?" And I think just to set the stage for this, certainly for next time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4261" target="_blank">01:11:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">is, yeah, I think my bold move, as I talked about with that episode with Dominic Cortuccio,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4267" target="_blank">01:11:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is I want this to be my healthiest year ever.

I think where, again, with my kind of over-anxiety</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4283" target="_blank">01:11:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">analytical brain, I would have let that be the limiting factor and not gotten started.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4287" target="_blank">01:11:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm going in with an open mind of, "Hey, I want to experiment."

I feel so much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4375" target="_blank">01:12:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">better because it actually looks at the brain and nervous system as almost going back to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4384" target="_blank">01:13:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">developmental milestones from when we were kids, when we were infants. And if you missed a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4390" target="_blank">01:13:10.240</a></span> | <span class="t">milestone, it's not like you were incapacitated for the rest of your life. Obviously, I've been</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4395" target="_blank">01:13:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">a fairly normal person, but you always are coming up with some workaround. And what that leads to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4402" target="_blank">01:13:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in a lot of cases, is injury and/or stress in certain spots. So very long story short,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4408" target="_blank">01:13:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">because again, we'll talk about this more in depth, is my neck and my hip flexors,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4413" target="_blank">01:13:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">which are constantly tight, have never felt better. I wake up in the morning and I'm like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4419" target="_blank">01:13:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">holy cow, I can move my hips in a way that I didn't think was possible. I didn't think it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4424" target="_blank">01:13:44.560</a></span> | <span class="t">was possible that I could feel this good. And that's just from a handful of times going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4430" target="_blank">01:13:50.240</a></span> | <span class="t">this DNS doctor. And again, with the experimenting and not worrying about money and just trying to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4436" target="_blank">01:13:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">explore this, it's fairly expensive. That's not covered by insurance. So I'm paying out of pocket</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4440" target="_blank">01:14:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">every single time I go, but it's working. And I would be foolish, in my opinion, to not do it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4447" target="_blank">01:14:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and to not continue just over dollars, which as Perkins would say, when you wake up and you're 85</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4453" target="_blank">01:14:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and you have more money than you could ever use, are you going to look back on whatever?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4457" target="_blank">01:14:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And now he would talk about experiences and memory dividends and all these things. But in my case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4462" target="_blank">01:14:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I might get extra years of vitality out of spending this money. So to me, it's an absolute</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4467" target="_blank">01:14:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">no-brainer. So there's that. The other thing is morning walks. I also listened to the Huberman</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4474" target="_blank">01:14:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Lab podcast a ton. So he's always talking about getting morning sunlight. And easiest way to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4479" target="_blank">01:14:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that is just going to walk. And it's just wonderful to be out in nature, peaceful in the morning,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4484" target="_blank">01:14:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">nobody's around, you get some morning sunlight. It's just been like these add-on effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4489" target="_blank">01:14:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I guess the third and biggest thing, though this is the newest, so I don't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4493" target="_blank">01:14:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">all that much to it, is I hired an online fitness coach who I found through Twitter. I believed in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4500" target="_blank">01:15:00.400</a></span> | <span class="t">what he was espousing, and he wound up having this program. And now, like I said before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4507" target="_blank">01:15:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going in to the gym with Jonathan, my Choose a Vibe business partner, four times a week now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4513" target="_blank">01:15:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's just awesome. It's also, frankly, like I talked about, making the effort for connection</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4519" target="_blank">01:15:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">is now I get to hang out with my buddy Jonathan six to eight hours a week when I wasn't previously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4524" target="_blank">01:15:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm working towards something because I think that's the other thing. I'm in reasonably good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4529" target="_blank">01:15:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">shape. So it's not like I'm going from couch potato to trying to be Mr. Olympia. That's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4535" target="_blank">01:15:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">what we're doing here. But so I'm in pretty good shape. But when I go into the gym, when I go into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4539" target="_blank">01:15:39.840</a></span> | <span class="t">CrossFit, I love it, but it doesn't feel like I'm working towards something. And I think having</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4545" target="_blank">01:15:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">goals and having tangible improvements and having an accountability partner are really going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4551" target="_blank">01:15:51.840</a></span> | <span class="t">benefit me. So naturally, like I said, we're in week two here. This is workout number eight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4556" target="_blank">01:15:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a very small sample size. But I think the conjunction of all of these things are really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4565" target="_blank">01:16:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">working pretty well. And then it's a mindset of exploration and just wanting to be as healthy as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4572" target="_blank">01:16:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I possibly can, because frankly, I'm 43 years old, which I still can't believe and not getting any</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4578" target="_blank">01:16:18.640</a></span> | <span class="t">younger, obviously. And the time is now. And I think that's how I'm thinking about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4585" target="_blank">01:16:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I'm turning 39 this year. And my goal is to dial in health before I turn 40.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4592" target="_blank">01:16:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I did an episode with Dr. Jordan Shlain. We talked about my... I've got high cholesterol and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4598" target="_blank">01:16:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">then the impact of that. So that's the thing that I'm tackling first. And through a combo of both</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4604" target="_blank">01:16:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">medicine and lifestyle changes. But I'm very early in that journey. So I need to get...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4611" target="_blank">01:16:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">When you have two small kids and you start a podcast and you go full time on it, I'm just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4615" target="_blank">01:16:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to... I felt like for a while I was treading water. And now I'm like, "Okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4620" target="_blank">01:17:00.240</a></span> | <span class="t">we're starting to get things dialed in. We need to get the exercise back on the regular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4625" target="_blank">01:17:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">regime." And I think we've been doing well with food. So I'm not too worried there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4630" target="_blank">01:17:10.160</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's the big one I'm focused on right now. Going back to very early conversation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4635" target="_blank">01:17:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I was talking about apps and how it's crazy to spend money. It's crazy how medical things are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4640" target="_blank">01:17:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">the same. It seems wild to pay for a doctor that isn't covered by your insurance or to pay for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4647" target="_blank">01:17:27.600</a></span> | <span class="t">treatment or to pay to get blood work done or blood analysis or DNA analysis, all these things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4652" target="_blank">01:17:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But it also seems crazy to not allocate some portion of your budget to your health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4659" target="_blank">01:17:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we actually had a conversation on that episode a few weeks ago about how do you think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4663" target="_blank">01:17:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">about what to allocate in your budget towards health? And after the fact, I emailed Jordan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4670" target="_blank">01:17:50.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I was like, "Hey, I'm thinking about a doctor." So Jordan runs a concierge practice that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4674" target="_blank">01:17:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">for me, is not within the budget that I want for my health. It's quite expensive. But I was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4680" target="_blank">01:18:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">"Do you know someone that I could work with? It's not as expensive." And he was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4683" target="_blank">01:18:03.440</a></span> | <span class="t">"What's your budget?" I was like, "I don't know."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4685" target="_blank">01:18:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Then I asked Amy and I was like, "What's our budget for health?" I'm like, "I don't know."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4688" target="_blank">01:18:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's something that I need an answer to because I think... I'm not necessarily always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4694" target="_blank">01:18:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the budgeting type, but a budget gives you permission to spend. And so in some areas,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4700" target="_blank">01:18:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I feel like I don't necessarily need a budget. I know what's a reasonable amount to spend just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4704" target="_blank">01:18:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">instinctively. But with health, I feel like I need to create a budget. And I might even start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4709" target="_blank">01:18:29.760</a></span> | <span class="t">doing this with an FSA, though open enrollment just ended. So I've got to wait a year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4714" target="_blank">01:18:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But I feel like I need to force myself to be comfortable spending money on health.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4719" target="_blank">01:18:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And if I could create a budget that says, "You need to spend... You have $2,000 to spend on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4724" target="_blank">01:18:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">health." And maybe the answer is you say, "Whatever's not here, we're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4730" target="_blank">01:18:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">give away." Or whatever is something that makes it a little bit more accountable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4733" target="_blank">01:18:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">With an FSA, it would be like that. Whatever you don't spend, you actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4737" target="_blank">01:18:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">can't use. You lose it. And so you could buy... I would encourage anyone who has an expiring FSA</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4742" target="_blank">01:19:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to go buy stuff that a local shelter needs and don't let it go to waste.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4747" target="_blank">01:19:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But I want to create something there because I feel like I need to force myself to spend more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4751" target="_blank">01:19:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">on my health. And that's a big one. So we have a whole list of 10 or 12 bullets of what we want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4757" target="_blank">01:19:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to focus on with health.

So we got a lot. Kids... Brad's superpower</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4767" target="_blank">01:19:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is teaching his kids all these amazing lessons. So we're going to get to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4772" target="_blank">01:19:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But I feel like we hit on a lot. I feel like we... I'm jazzed to go do a lot of the things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4780" target="_blank">01:19:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we talked about that you shared. This is awesome. Yeah, this is amazing. It actually... I knew this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4786" target="_blank">01:19:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to be fun. It worked out even better than I anticipated. And yeah, it's pretty wild.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4790" target="_blank">01:19:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We have so many of these things, A, to follow up on. Like we said, this will be some accountability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4795" target="_blank">01:19:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">But B, yeah, there's all these topics we didn't get to. So I'm up for doing this. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4800" target="_blank">01:20:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">a handful of times a year minimum.

I mean, super valuable. And obviously, it's always good to talk to you,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_178vVDScMw&t=4809" target="_blank">01:20:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">my friend. So that's selfishly...
