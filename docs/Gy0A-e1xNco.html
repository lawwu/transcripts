This is AT&T's dividend</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0A-e1xNco&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.940</a></span> | <span class="t">yield over the past 10 years. It's really high right now, mainly because the stock has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0A-e1xNco&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.100</a></span> | <span class="t">gotten crushed. But the average dividend yield for AT&T stock for the past 10 years is 5.7%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0A-e1xNco&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.820</a></span> | <span class="t">You're getting almost 6% dividend yield for 10 years. Now, let's do another chart on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0A-e1xNco&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.340</a></span> | <span class="t">This is the return of AT&T stock versus the S&P 500 over 10 years. The S&P is up nearly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0A-e1xNco&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.020</a></span> | <span class="t">400%, and this is total return. So, AT&T, they're up about 60%, a little less than 60%,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0A-e1xNco&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">with dividends. Basically, that entire return is dividends, because their price is actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0A-e1xNco&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.580</a></span> | <span class="t">down over that time. And so, I just want to make sure that people aren't too caught up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0A-e1xNco&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">in just earning income, because total return is really the only thing that matters. Right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0A-e1xNco&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, if you're doing this because you think you need more income, that's not always the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0A-e1xNco&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.900</a></span> | <span class="t">best answer. Income can play an important role in your portfolio, but total return is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0A-e1xNco&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.060</a></span> | <span class="t">the only thing that matters.

But you can always create your own dividend stream by simply selling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0A-e1xNco&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.540</a></span> | <span class="t">shares in stocks or the funds that you own.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0A-e1xNco&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, if you want to diversify from tech stocks, that's a different story. Obviously, the simple</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0A-e1xNco&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.160</a></span> | <span class="t">answer here is just to take some gains from your tax-deferred accounts. You don't pay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0A-e1xNco&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">the capital gains taxes. If you're going to do a portfolio rebalance, do it in the tax-deferred</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0A-e1xNco&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.380</a></span> | <span class="t">way. Don't take the gains and pay the taxes on them, and then put it into income-producing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0A-e1xNco&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.560</a></span> | <span class="t">assets that you're paying taxes on again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0A-e1xNco&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So, finding reliable income sources is another story.

All</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0A-e1xNco&t=291" target="_blank">00:04:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">these things. We've looked into all this stuff. Anything with higher yield right now comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0A-e1xNco&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.340</a></span> | <span class="t">with higher return. That's period, end of story. There's more risk. Most of these other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy0A-e1xNco&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.660</a></span> | <span class="t">asset classes that have high income also have high drawdowns, like the stock market.
