And I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.940</a></span> | <span class="t">it's, and you may be able to articulate this even better than I can, but, you know, I think we need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=35" target="_blank">00:00:35.580</a></span> | <span class="t">to look at stress, right?

And it gives us, you know, it's so many, it's, we have one at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.140</a></span> | <span class="t">home and when friends come over to use it, it's so funny because I think the first time they're going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.520</a></span> | <span class="t">to do it. And I know you've had a lot of people, we actually, I was at your home a couple of years</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.260</a></span> | <span class="t">ago and there was a guy who was doing it for the first time. And he's like a big, I don't remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.220</a></span> | <span class="t">this, but he's like a big athletic guy. And he, he was freaking out, getting into, terrified. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=113" target="_blank">00:01:53.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's just cold water. There's no, it can't, I mean, it could hurt you if you're in there for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">however long to get hypothermia, but it's not going to hurt you. So having practices like that that allow</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">us to move through that level of fear can translate to fear or distress can translate when it, it comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in real time for something that we, that I know I can walk through this. Yeah. Because adrenaline is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.900</a></span> | <span class="t">ubiquitous in stressful circumstances, which is just a bunch of science nerd speak for the stress</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.300</a></span> | <span class="t">response is always an increase in autonomic arousal or alertness, a shrinking of the visual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.700</a></span> | <span class="t">field, an increase in heart rate, a tendency to move. People will say, but I freeze actually the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">freezing response. This is kind of interesting. My lab studied this. Lindsay Soleil published a paper</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in nature about this in 2018. She was a graduate student in my lab. The freezing response is an active</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.540</a></span> | <span class="t">behavior. Oh yeah. Trying to hide from, from an intruder in your home, in the closet, you're trying not to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.660</a></span> | <span class="t">move. So people think, Oh, you know, people freeze under stress. No, the freezing response is an active</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.600</a></span> | <span class="t">response. You know, the adrenaline dump is sometimes called is, is what essentially creates the freeze</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.460</a></span> | <span class="t">response. It's why people can't remember things when they get up on stage, if they have a fear of public</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">public speaking. Um, and I was going to, uh, I forgot to mention in the cold plunge, cold water is a highly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">reliable way to elicit an adrenaline response. Yeah. It's just a great training for this feels</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.220</a></span> | <span class="t">uncomfortable.

Yeah. So that would fit into the proactive, right? So that's something that you can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.620</a></span> | <span class="t">proactively start to be able to manage that adrenaline as you're, as you're telling me in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in the body, right? You're, we're able to manage those feelings because what is it come down to is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">it's a, it's a, these sensations in our body that we're experiencing that feel really uncomfortable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And we might be able to sense them a little earlier. Right. If we have some training, I just want to throw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=230" target="_blank">00:03:50.140</a></span> | <span class="t">in one little science tidbit, as long as we're talking about using cold as a way to manage, um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">distress tolerance is that the first 15 to 20 seconds after the adrenaline response hits and it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=242" target="_blank">00:04:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">hits very fast, your forebrain, which is involved in all your contextual decision-making and clean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.420</a></span> | <span class="t">clear strategies of what best to do is essentially shut down for about 20 seconds. If you can make it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">20 seconds, you have a far better chance of not doing something really stupid and doing something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">that's very adaptive. Right. Now there may be circumstances where you don't have 20 seconds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.280</a></span> | <span class="t">but if under stress and riding out that 20 seconds is, uh, generally going to be a very adaptive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">approach because then your forebrain comes back, quote unquote, online, and you could really start to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">make strategic decisions based on those particular circumstances. And so that's, what's happening when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">we get, uh, experienced, people say get triggered by something that's, uh, uncomfortable for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.

Right. So someone might get that text and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.720</a></span> | <span class="t">they immediately go into like their perception or their beliefs or their kind of narrative about what that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">means.

So now sitting there looking at a text</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">message, which is really just a, a neutral it's, it's all events are neutral. We bring the meaning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">to them and we want to bring meaning to them, but it's just words on a, a screen. And we don't even</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">know what it means yet.

And we're never really out of the present. People say, get present.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.260</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the only place we live.

If the first step is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to, to, after we recognize that this is something that happening is to stop when we're in the middle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiWStms-WJs&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of response.
