Ricardo says, Do you recommend having multiple email accounts for someone who works at different institutions? Even if the work is similar between institutions? Yes, Ricardo. In general, I'm in favor of multiple email accounts. I want more friction, not less. But more importantly, I want context shifting to be minimized.</p><p>The biggest under emphasized tax we pay when doing professional work is the cognitive drag required by shifting our mental context from one target to another. It's draining, it reduces our ability to think and it burns us out. So when you are sharing multiple institutional communications all happening in one inbox, you're seeing multiple professional contexts existing together and your brain is trying to bounce back and forth between these things.</p><p>It's terrible for the brain. Terrible for the brain. I have, I think six email addresses right now. And then Jesse has another for our organization. But I personally have six email addresses because I want to keep these things separate. I use separate in Google Chrome, you can have these profiles, browser profiles so that like if you have your password, say for Gmail for one address, you can switch to another platform, another profile where you have your address saved for Gmail for a completely different account.</p><p>And so I have three, three of those and six different email addresses. And you know, I'll tell you what, some people get mad because like, oh, it's longer before I hear back from you because I have to, you have to wait until I'm next at a day or time where I'm checking that address, but it keeps the context shifting minimized.</p><p>That's critical.</p></div></div></body></html>
