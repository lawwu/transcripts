I think a mature way to think about these things is not to deny that there are any costs, but to think about what the costs are and what the benefits are. I think we've been relatively responsible in the sense that, you know, the big acceleration that happened late last year and beginning of this year, like we didn't cause that, we weren't the ones who did that.</p><p>And honestly, I think if you look at the reaction to Google, that might be 10 times more important than anything else. And then once it had happened, once the ecosystem had changed, then we did a lot of things to stay on the frontier. And so, I don't know, it's like any other question, right?</p><p>You're trying to do the things that have the lowest costs and the biggest benefits that causes you to have different strategies at different times.</p></div></div></body></html>
