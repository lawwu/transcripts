It's not just to be a billionaire and all that. And you've talked a lot about philanthropy. So, and how that's become a more, a bigger focus in your life. And I think beyond just saying why it's important, you've thought about ways to infuse it into your future business, your future endeavors.</p><p>Talk a bit about why it's important, but also how you're trying to bring it into your business that maybe is different than the way most people think about philanthropy. - Few ways that I'm looking at it right now. First of all, like, I, everyone believes this, but I really like internalize it.</p><p>It's that like, nobody gets out alive. Like we all die and it doesn't make sense to be the richest guy in the graveyard. Like, I don't care about legacy. I don't care about my kids being rich. Like I don't plan to actually give my kids anything. Maybe they'll get a little bit, maybe they'll get a property or two, whatever.</p><p>- No, they get the college savings property. - Yes, they get the college thing, yeah. And what's great about that too, by the way, just to go way back to the last episode that we did together, but that property, like I don't care if Rosie takes that one property and goes to college with it, or she starts a business.</p><p>I actually hope she'll just start a business with it or invest it in something. But anyway, I don't need my kid to be rich because A, like you can't grow up in the Turner, the Brandon Turner household and not have all the skills you need to be successful, first of all.</p><p>'Cause like, I'm going to train her. I train him every day. I'm always talking about money and finances and entrepreneurship and Rosie has bake sales and Wilder will, you know, when he's a little older. So either A, if they're not wealthy by the time they're in their mid twenties, then there is some problem that they don't deserve the money anyway, right?</p><p>Like my kids will either not need the money 'cause they'll be so successful anyway, or they don't deserve the money because they can't handle it. So anyway, that's why I'm not planning to give my kids money. So in other words, what do I do with it then? I mean, wealth is kind of a game in some ways.</p><p>Like I don't have to earn more money and get wealthier, but it's kind of a fun, it's a fun challenge. Like, can I give away a billion dollars? Like, I would have laughed at that 10 years ago. And now I'm like, well, shoot. Yeah, I could definitely give away a billion dollars.</p><p>Plus happiness is largely derived for most people by giving away money and not just like throwing something from random charity, but by doing something with it. Like it's one thing to make money. It's another thing to make money matter. So I wanna spend a lot of my time making money 'cause I'm good at it.</p><p>I'm not just gonna like give away all my money right now and go live under a bridge. Like I have been gifted with this ability to generate mass amounts of money. So I'm gonna use that to its fullest ability. And then I'm gonna make that money count. I'm gonna make it matter through business.</p><p>So a couple of ways we do that. Number one, there's like the obvious, like we try to take good care of our tenants and be good people and all that. That's not what I'm talking about. I wanna start, we're gonna start, actually we're gonna launch it hopefully in the next couple of months.</p><p>We're gonna raise capital for big apartment complexes. And then we're going to take all the profit from that and just donate it. So for example, let me give you a real simple. We buy a $100 million building right now. It's pretty normal by let's say $100 million building. We have to raise 20 or $30 million from investors like you.</p><p>You give the money, we will buy the property. At the end of the deal, we sell it for $150 million. Very normal, very just 3%, 4% per year over the course of 10 years, it gets there. And then at the end of the deal, everyone gets their money. We divide up all, everyone gets their piece of the pie and everyone is happy.</p><p>But what I wanna do is I wanna raise all that money. And then at the end of the deal, when we sell the property two, three, four, five years later, you get your investment back, but all the profit, that $50 million goes to charity. And I'm like, I could do like one of those a year and be like the biggest charity in the country.</p><p>Like it's stupid how good real estate and especially my division of real estate, syndication and multifamily, it's stupid how much profit we can create out of thin air and with that level of assuredness, of that little surety. And so if I can just take like one out of every 10 deals I do and just donate it to good, that makes everyone feel good.</p><p>And then the LPs, even like you, if you were investing in that, not only do you get to feel good, not only do you get your money back, so you're not even donating it, you're just lending the money for a little while basically, you also get a big tax write-off at the end.</p><p>And so it's like a win, win, win across the board. Everyone feels good. Everybody wins. We're saving lives. We're stopping human trafficking. We're feeding kids. It's gonna be a good life. So I'm fired up about that right now.</p></div></div></body></html>
