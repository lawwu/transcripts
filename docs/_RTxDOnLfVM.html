Now for tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=7" target="_blank">00:00:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in Agents SDK there are various ways that we can use them. First we have pre-built tools so there is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=15" target="_blank">00:00:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">a small number of these pre-built tools that come with Agents SDK. They are OpenAI built and they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=22" target="_blank">00:00:22.780</a></span> | <span class="t">allow us to do a few interesting things. Then there are of course custom tools so we can define our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.340</a></span> | <span class="t">own tools and use those as well. So in this chapter we'll work through those and take a look at how we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">use tools and how we can best use tools in Agents SDK. So for this notebook I would recommend actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=46" target="_blank">00:00:46.580</a></span> | <span class="t">you can open this one in Colab or if you prefer run it locally. It is completely up to you. We of course</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">will need the OpenAI API key unless you're using another provider. Although with another provider I will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.100</a></span> | <span class="t">note that these pre-built tools will not work. So yeah you have to be using OpenAI models to use these. So there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.840</a></span> | <span class="t">are a few of these pre-built tools from Agents SDK. Those include the Web Search tool, the File Search</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">tool and Computer Use tool among others. And we're just going to take a quick look at the Web Search tool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.580</a></span> | <span class="t">which we briefly use in the previous example. So when we're passing tools to our Agents, we define an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Agent object, we pass the name instructions as we would usually do, we also pass a model as we would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">usually do. But then we also provide tools. Okay and this is just a list of these function tool objects and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.320</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll see that in a moment. Right now it's just a pre-built web search tool. Another thing to note</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.260</a></span> | <span class="t">here is that the Nano model is not recommended for tools. So you should use at least Mini ideally.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Now we can see which tools an Agent object has access to by just looking at the tools attribute. And we'll</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.300</a></span> | <span class="t">see a list. In this case it's just a web search tool that we just defined. And as we usually would do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.980</a></span> | <span class="t">we use the runner object to run our Agent and get some results from there. So you can see the final</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">output there. So that is today. And this all seems relatively recent. Now although the pre-built tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.260</a></span> | <span class="t">are, you know, they're really nice. It's nice to have those. In most cases I think the majority of tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.500</a></span> | <span class="t">we would be using are either defined through MCP or they are custom tools. Custom tools that we are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">building and we are defining within the framework. Now the way that we do that is we use this function</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.140</a></span> | <span class="t">tool object. Now the function tool, it's a decorator, we're using it here. Function tool used in this way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">converts our tool here which is just fetching the time and it's just returning the time for us. So we might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.820</a></span> | <span class="t">use this in this scenario that we need to be able to tell our LLM or the LLM needs to be able to check</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.200</a></span> | <span class="t">time. Maybe the user says, hey, you know, what time is it right now? Or how many days is it until</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Christmas, right? In this case the LLM might go and use a fetch time tool. You may also just insert time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.380</a></span> | <span class="t">directly into your system prompt if this is something where you're expecting your agent to be like time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">aware like a lot of the time or you can just give it all to use. It depends.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this case we're just going to define a function tool for our model to fetch the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Now one thing, if we don't set the name overrider here, this is optional, right? So we can just do,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, without that, we could just do function tool. But in this case, the function tool name</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.520</a></span> | <span class="t">as provided to our LLM will be fetch time. Alternatively, if you want to give it an actual</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.440</a></span> | <span class="t">name or a different name to what the function is called, you can do that. So you just use this name</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">override parameter. I believe also that the name here cannot be, it needs to follow like a lowercase</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.760</a></span> | <span class="t">with underscores format. So let's just try that because I don't quite remember. Okay. You can see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=278" target="_blank">00:04:38.420</a></span> | <span class="t">if we do that, if we don't format that name correctly, we're going to get this. So invalid tool's name</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=284" target="_blank">00:04:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">string does not match pattern. Okay. And it tells you here, this is the pattern we're allowed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're allowed to have hyphens. We're allowed, we are actually allowed uppercase. So we're allowed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.740</a></span> | <span class="t">uppercase, lowercase and numbers or underscores. Okay. So that's good to know. So we could, if we wanted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">to, we could just do something like this. That should work, but I'll revert it to what we had before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Now we can just confirm that this is a function tool object. And you see, yes, our fetch time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.640</a></span> | <span class="t">function is in fact a function tool object. That's great. That means, that means our decorator worked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">as expected. And because it's a function tool object, that means we can, we have these specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.140</a></span> | <span class="t">attributes that we can pull out. So we can get the name, which you'll see a moment ago,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I modified this. Let's run this again. And we'll see that it's now our underscore name there or a valid</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=345" target="_blank">00:05:45.960</a></span> | <span class="t">name. We can see the description. Hey, that's weird. Where did we, where did we set that? So let's come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.600</a></span> | <span class="t">back up a little bit and we can see that the description is being pulled from the dark string. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.240</a></span> | <span class="t">this dark string here is actually pretty important. It is in here that you described your LLM how and when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.080</a></span> | <span class="t">it should use a particular tool. Okay. So it's important that you, that you use this and make sure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.660</a></span> | <span class="t">that you describe, right? In this scenario, this is a very simple scenario. So it doesn't, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.100</a></span> | <span class="t">we just write something simple, but for example, web search in your dark string here, you should be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=385" target="_blank">00:06:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">telling your LLM, look, this is a web search tool you should use, or you should provide as much useful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">context as possible in your search query. This is in natural language. If it's a, depending on what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">web search engine you're using, right? So you can give the LLM instructions on how to best use your tool</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.100</a></span> | <span class="t">within this dark string. That, that is an important thing. You should always do that. Then we can also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.860</a></span> | <span class="t">check the parameters. So parameters here, we can see, okay, this function, terrible example, it doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.600</a></span> | <span class="t">have any parameters. So we're going to see, okay, there's no required parameters. There's just nothing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.480</a></span> | <span class="t">in here. So that's fine. We're going to see later a tool with parameters. Okay. So we have our output</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">class here. We don't necessarily need to use this, but this is, this allows us to do structured output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm going to run without this first and I'm going to switch to using it. So do this and let's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.080</a></span> | <span class="t">run this and see, see what we get. Okay. So something happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's take a look. Okay. So we've got this. The current time is this. Now the, what I want to show you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.780</a></span> | <span class="t">with that output class is that you can also structure your output. So in this, this is a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, we're adding a lot of complexity to a very simple use case here, but it's good for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.140</a></span> | <span class="t">demoing all of this. We want our response. Okay. As we just got, that's just our response here. But I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.440</a></span> | <span class="t">also want the LM to tell me why did it do what it did. Okay. So the LM is just going to say, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I use the fetch current time tool because the user asked about the current time. So I needed to do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">that. Right. So we should see something like that. So yeah, we define that both of these outputs are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.280</a></span> | <span class="t">strings. You may also, I don't know, let's say we want like a confidence score, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.300</a></span> | <span class="t">that could be a float. Uh, yeah, you can see, thank you copilot for writing that for me. You can see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.800</a></span> | <span class="t">the confidence here. We have our flow. This is a confidence level in its response from zero to one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So that can actually be a pretty useful thing to, to include as well in general. So yeah, this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">structured output that we are providing. And we provide that via the output type parameter as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=532" target="_blank">00:08:52.340</a></span> | <span class="t">before. We're going to use that runner object. And then let's see what final output is because now we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">have multiple outputs. So it's going to be a bit different. Okay. We can see output class, the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=543" target="_blank">00:09:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">response here, and we can see the approach taken. I fetch current time using systems time query function</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.820</a></span> | <span class="t">to provide you with the exact and update time. Okay. That's great. And then we see that is the output</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.980</a></span> | <span class="t">class that we defined that that object. So we can also go in there. If we want to access each one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">those specific values, we can go in like that. Okay. So we come to here. No, I already printed it here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Nevermind. We can print it again. Okay. And we can also use the function tool object here as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, we can do that with Pydantic, for example. This can be useful if you are wanting to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">define a particular structure for the input. So you can see here in this example, we have these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.260</a></span> | <span class="t">function args. We're going to be using these function args in a tool, which is just going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=601" target="_blank">00:10:01.940</a></span> | <span class="t">multiply two numbers together. Again, super simple example, but nonetheless, really simple example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=608" target="_blank">00:10:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We have the description for that. So this is the, you know, where we had the dark string before,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=612" target="_blank">00:10:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but then we also have this params JSON schema, right? Params JSON schema is consuming what we have up here</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">and using that to describe to our LM what the input parameters are. And this is really useful because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.500</a></span> | <span class="t">by default, we can't do that. So if we, we just define a function and we decorate it with function</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=633" target="_blank">00:10:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">tool, we can't specify in that function descriptions for each and every parameter, right? So if you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.080</a></span> | <span class="t">a set of parameters you need to describe, this is really useful for those more complex use cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=647" target="_blank">00:10:47.960</a></span> | <span class="t">You can describe everything in much more detail using this approach, which is, it's pretty good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can also validate things as they're coming in as well. So that's great. We, we do still need to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of course, define our function that is going to be used. So we have this multiply numbers function here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and we would just pass that down here to the on invoke tool. Okay. So we have that. Now we can come</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=676" target="_blank">00:11:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">down and just see, as we did before, we can see everything that we have defined. So we get name</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.860</a></span> | <span class="t">and description as before. Okay. We define these a different way before, but the outcome is the same.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So this is the, within that function tool object, these are those attributes. And then we also have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=696" target="_blank">00:11:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">this parameter JSON schema. This one is a little bit different because now we have parameters. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So within the properties dictionary here, before this was empty because we had no parameters. Now there are parameters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We have X and Y. And also within those parameters, we have descriptions. Okay. So this is all getting sent to the LLM.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">The LLM now knows exactly what each one of these parameters is for. Of course, in this example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">this is a very basic example, it's not really needed, but for more complicated tools, this is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=728" target="_blank">00:12:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">this can be very helpful. We also have this required parameter down here. Now this is saying, okay,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.220</a></span> | <span class="t">X and Y are both required parameters for this function. So the LLM knows it must generate both</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.900</a></span> | <span class="t">of these to use the tool correctly. What may happen, right? You, you might have optional parameters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's just set one of these to optional very quickly. Let's say, you know, we don't need</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">X for whatever reason. So we'll run this. We'll come down to here and we'll now see if we make the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.780</a></span> | <span class="t">scrollable, we'll see it required is now just Y. We don't need X. It's an optional parameter,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=764" target="_blank">00:12:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">but X is still provided within our schema here. So it's still described. The LLM still knows it can use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">X if it needs to, but it's an optional parameter. So it doesn't have to, which can be really used.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, you come and need that in, in many tools. So we have that. Um, we, of course, in this scenario,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=783" target="_blank">00:13:03.940</a></span> | <span class="t">we are definitely going to keep X as a required parameter. So rerun those. So let's just go down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">here and run our new query. So we're saying we want to multiply 3.41 by 7.2. Let's see what we get here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.060</a></span> | <span class="t">We can, uh, we can, well, we, we're going to get an object out of this. I'll just show you that very</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.940</a></span> | <span class="t">quickly. So final outputs. That's because we, we set our output class again down here and we can see</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=814" target="_blank">00:13:34.340</a></span> | <span class="t">response and approach taken. And we'll just print both of those out a little more nicely here. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=821" target="_blank">00:13:41.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's pretty cool. Now the very last thing we'll, we'll take a quick look at here. We will cover this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.460</a></span> | <span class="t">in a little more, a little more detail later. We want to look at agents as tools. So in agents SDK,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.060</a></span> | <span class="t">we can use handoffs and agents as tools as ways to handle multi-agent systems. Now agents as tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">is what it sounds like. You define an agent and then you actually just provide that agent as a tool for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.220</a></span> | <span class="t">another agent. So in this example, kind of a, again, silly example, because you would just use the tools</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=859" target="_blank">00:14:19.460</a></span> | <span class="t">directly, but nonetheless, in this example, we're going to have our multiply agent, which has access to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.260</a></span> | <span class="t">multiply tool. And then we also have a time agent, which has access to the fetch time tool. In reality, it's, you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.860</a></span> | <span class="t">probably use both of these as more like, okay, this is my social media agent. It is the agent that is going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.460</a></span> | <span class="t">to read all of my social media things and generate posts for me or make posts for me. And then maybe we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=890" target="_blank">00:14:50.020</a></span> | <span class="t">have like a writer agent, which has been prompted with all this, you know, writing goodness and maybe can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.700</a></span> | <span class="t">reference, you know, our past materials to generate a article or social media post or whatever. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And those two agents would work in tandem to, you know, like read, okay, what, what should we talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.380</a></span> | <span class="t">about? I'm going to generate a post and, you know, post it out and, you know, just generate loads of AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.700</a></span> | <span class="t">slop for everyone to scroll past as they're on their, on X or LinkedIn or whatever else. Right. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.860</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, you might want to use it or not for, for that. This example is a little silly in that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.860</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, we would just use like, you probably won't even use these as tools a lot of the time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=934" target="_blank">00:15:34.900</a></span> | <span class="t">but nonetheless, this is how it works. So coming down here, we've created our two tool agents or sub</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=943" target="_blank">00:15:43.060</a></span> | <span class="t">agents, however you want to call them. And then we're also going to create this orchestra agent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=947" target="_blank">00:15:47.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is the kind of like the controlling agent. So when you're using agents as tools,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=952" target="_blank">00:15:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">you do need like a top level agent. And we actually don't need to provide this information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.180</a></span> | <span class="t">here. We can remove that. So it's just saying, okay, you're an orchestra agent. You're going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.500</a></span> | <span class="t">do some stuff. And then we have these two tools, which are agents, right? So we just write the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=970" target="_blank">00:16:10.100</a></span> | <span class="t">multiply agent or the agent name as tool. Then we provide the tool name. So as you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.180</a></span> | <span class="t">how do we call this and the description for it as well, let's go ahead and let's, let's put all this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=981" target="_blank">00:16:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">together. Let's run and we'll say, what time is it? Now, when we're using agents and tools, just remember</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=988" target="_blank">00:16:28.100</a></span> | <span class="t">that, okay, we have our orchestra agent that is going to say, I want to use the time agent. Time agent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">checks time, writes a response, takes it to the orchestra agent. Then the orchestra agent is going to write,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.260</a></span> | <span class="t">it's going to read that response and then write the response to you. So it's a token heavy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.140</a></span> | <span class="t">approach. Just bear that in mind. The, the handoffs are a bit lighter and better than we'll look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">those pretty soon. So let's see what we got. And yes, you can see. Okay, cool. So we can take a quick</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=1022" target="_blank">00:17:02.020</a></span> | <span class="t">look at our tracers to see what that looked like. So the, the multi-agent thing, you can see the two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.580</a></span> | <span class="t">tools we use here. So go into there. There was two tools were actually the orchestra agent calling the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.660</a></span> | <span class="t">fetch current time agent, and then the fetch current time agent calling the fetch current time tool. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, I just want to emphasize that this is not the way that you should use sub agents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RTxDOnLfVM&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.580</a></span> | <span class="t">like all agents as tools in agents SDK. This is a very, very silly example.
