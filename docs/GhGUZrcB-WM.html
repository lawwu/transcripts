This is the first video in what will be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=4" target="_blank">00:00:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of like a mini-series on how we can train a transformer from scratch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=10" target="_blank">00:00:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot of you have been asking for this in one way or another, so we're just going to run through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=17" target="_blank">00:00:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of everything I think you need to know to actually just build your own transformer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=25" target="_blank">00:00:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are a few different parts to this and that's why I'm doing it in a series because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=31" target="_blank">00:00:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">otherwise it would be a super long video. So we're just going to break it down into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">a few different parts. So the first video is going to be on getting our data and that's what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you're watching now. So we're going to learn how to use the Hugging Face datasets library,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.560</a></span> | <span class="t">which I think is very good actually. So we'll take a look at that. In the next video,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll have a look at actually training the tokenizer with that data. And then in these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">bits here, so these three parts, they might just be one video. I'm not sure I'm going to see how it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">flows. So there will probably be maybe one or two videos. Let's see. So we'll move on to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">getting our data over in Python. Now when it comes to getting data to train a transformer model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">we are pretty much spoiled for choice. All we really need is unstructured text data,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">which of course there's a lot of that on the internet. Now there's one dataset in particular</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">that I've noticed that is very good called Oscar and that is a multilingual dataset.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.400</a></span> | <span class="t">It has like hundreds of languages, I think, like really loads. So we're going to go ahead and use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that. Now to download the dataset or the Oscar dataset, we will be using a transformers library</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">called datasets. So if you do need to, you can pip install that. So you just do pip install</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">datasets. And once we have that, we just want to import datasets. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.520</a></span> | <span class="t">what we can do if we want to just view all of the datasets that are available to us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">within our notebook here is we can write datasets.list datasets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And let's just print out how many we have, because there's quite a few. So at the moment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">there's 965 of those. So I'm not going to print all of them out, but let's just have a look at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=172" target="_blank">00:02:52.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a few of those so we can see what we actually have here. So here's just five. So it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">alphabetically sorted. So we have five datasets all beginning with A. Now, one of these is called</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Oscar. So we can write Oscar pin or ds. We see true, but we can't really get that much information</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">from within Python. So what we can do is head on over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">to this website here, which is the Hugging Face datasets viewer, which is really cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So what we do is we go over here on the left, and we can search for a dataset based on tags.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Or what we'll be using is the actual dataset name. So we can just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">go through and see all these datasets. There's loads of them. Now, if I scroll down quite a lot,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you can also type in at the top, you will find, or I should find Oscar here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Now we search for Oscar, and then we also get this subset here. This is another important thing. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Oscar has all these different subset of languages within its dataset,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and these are all of those. Now, if you want to know what each of those are,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=271" target="_blank">00:04:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">because we just get a letter here, which is not really that useful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we can go over here. So this is oscarcorpus.com.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And I believe we click here. Okay. So we scroll down to here, and we have a big list of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">all of the languages here. So we have the language, and then we have the AF here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.040</a></span> | <span class="t">which is the first one. So the first one we know is Africans. Now, if we scroll down, I'm going to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">go, I only know English, but my girlfriend is Italian and she's going to come along and hopefully</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">tell us that the model works at some point. So we're going to be using Italian because that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=323" target="_blank">00:05:23.760</a></span> | <span class="t">literally the only choice I have other than English, and that's kind of boring. So we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">going to go with this one. So we need to search for the one with IT at the end. We come here,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and we can just type it in, I think, or maybe we can't. There we go. So we click that, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.400</a></span> | <span class="t">we are not actually allowed to view it because it's too big. I didn't realize that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's go with, I think, Latin you can view.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So obviously, this is in Italian, this is Latin, but you can see here we have the ID,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and we have text, and this is the data set that we're going to be using. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.200</a></span> | <span class="t">let's go back over to, let's copy this, and we'll go back over to our code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, what we do is we're going to be loading that data set or downloading</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=386" target="_blank">00:06:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">data set into this data set variable. We want to write data sets,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">load data sets, and here we want to write Oscar, which is the data set name,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and then we also want to include the subset. So our subset is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">hmm, not pasting. That's fine. It's unshuffled, deduplicated, IT.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=419" target="_blank">00:06:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So here we go. So I already have it downloaded, I think, so that's not going to download it again,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">but you should get a loading bar if this is your first time downloading this data set,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and that might take a little bit of time. Okay. So that has loaded for me now, so I can</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">do this, and we can see that we have this data set dictionary object, and inside there we have this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=449" target="_blank">00:07:29.360</a></span> | <span class="t">one item. So sometimes you have training data and testing data. We just have training data here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have train, and then inside that we have our data. So we have this many samples, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=464" target="_blank">00:07:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">28.5 million samples. I'm not going to use all of them because it will just take a very long time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.760</a></span> | <span class="t">and we have the two features that we saw before. So we have the ID,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=478" target="_blank">00:07:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and then we also have the text, which is what we care about. Now, if we wanted to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=485" target="_blank">00:08:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">just have a look at one of those, we could write train zero like this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=492" target="_blank">00:08:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and we see our data. Okay. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.760</a></span> | <span class="t">that's good, but when we're training our tokenizer, we're going to want to read these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=509" target="_blank">00:08:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">in from file rather than keeping them in memory. So what we're going to do is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.080</a></span> | <span class="t">first I'm going to import tqdm because this can take a little bit of time. So I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">have a loading bar so that we can actually see what is happening,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and from there we want to initialize the list, which is going to contain our text data.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I'm going to do is, so I'm going to loop through all of this data, format it in a way that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">we can then save it to file that we would expect for the tokenizer. So it essentially needs every</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=563" target="_blank">00:09:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">sample to be on a new line, and I'm just going to take, I think, 10,000 of those samples,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">put them into a file, and then save it and move on to the next file. So this is what the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">file count is for. I'm just going to write something like, I don't know, Italian data zero,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=581" target="_blank">00:09:41.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Italian data one, Italian data two, and so on. So we're going to loop through all of our samples,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">so for sample in, and here I'm going to wrap it in tqdm so that we can see the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.160</a></span> | <span class="t">loading bar or the progress bar. And here we're just going to go data set train,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=602" target="_blank">00:10:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">so that will go through all of our samples. Now we're going to be splitting each sample with a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">new line character, which also means we need to remove any other new line characters from our</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">data, otherwise we're going to be splitting each sample into multiple samples, which we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=620" target="_blank">00:10:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">don't really want. So we write sample equals sample, and in here, remember, we have ID</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and text here, so we want to access the text specifically, and we're going to replace the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">new line characters in there with just spaces, I think, yeah. Then what we're going to do is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">text data append sample, so that is going to add one sample to our text data list up here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now what we want to do is say if the length of that text data list</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">hits 10k, at that point, we want to save it to file, so I'm going to write with open,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=680" target="_blank">00:11:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and I'm just going to call it Italian text, or just IT, and I'll put in the file count,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.040</a></span> | <span class="t">so file count dot txt. We're going to be writing that, and then we just write fp dot write.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">We're using new line characters here, so we're just going to join everything within</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.560</a></span> | <span class="t">our text data list like that, and we also want to just here include the encoding, so utf-8.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Now once we've written that data, we don't want to keep all of the current data within</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">the text data variable or text data list, because we have 10,000, we want to sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">reinitialize that list so that we start again, and then we print the next, or we save the next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">10,000 after that. So we want to write text data equals, and it's going to equal an empty list,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=750" target="_blank">00:12:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and then obviously we just keep saving it with the current file count, we're just going to keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.200</a></span> | <span class="t">overwriting ourselves, so we need to add one to the file count. Now that will save most of our data,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=763" target="_blank">00:12:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">but on the final batch, so we have, what do we have?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So we have this many samples, and if we take that, we are left with 2,082 samples at the end</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.080</a></span> | <span class="t">there, so that means they will not save because it will not reach the 10k on that final loop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So at the very end here, all we're going to do is, I think we just copy this,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">so we will copy that, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah, that should be fine, so that will save that final 2k that we have there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=817" target="_blank">00:13:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm going to run that, I think it can take a while, well let me see, I think it does take a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">while, so what's that, 20, that's kind of weird, yeah it's going to take maybe 30 minutes, so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">that's fine. So after we have done that, we move on to what I'm going to cover in the next video,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhGUZrcB-WM&t=853" target="_blank">00:14:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">which is actually training our tokenizer, so I'll see you there.</span></div></div></body></html>
