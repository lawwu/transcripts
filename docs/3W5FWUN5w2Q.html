What are the differences?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=37" target="_blank">00:00:37.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So the biggest commonality of them is that they're both the subject of personality cults,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=43" target="_blank">00:00:43.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and that Mao was the center of a very intensely felt one from 1949 to 1976.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And when he died, there was tremendous outpouring of grief,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.120</a></span> | <span class="t">even among people who had objectively suffered enormously because of his policies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Xi Jinping is the first leader in China since him who has had a sustained personality cult of the kind</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">where if you walk into a bookstore in China, the first thing you see are books by him, collections of speeches.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And when Mao was alive, you might have thought that's sort of what happened with communist party leaders in China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">But after Mao's death, there was such an effort to not have that kind of personality cult that there was a tendency to not publish the speeches of a leader until they were done being in power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=92" target="_blank">00:01:32.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I was first in China in 1986, and you could go for days without being intensely aware of who was in charge of the party.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.140</a></span> | <span class="t">You would know, but his face wasn't everywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">The newspaper wasn't dominated with stories about him and quotations from his words and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=112" target="_blank">00:01:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So with Xi Jinping, you've had a throwback to that period in communist party rule, which seemed as though it might be a part of the past.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's a key commonality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And a key difference is that Mao really reveled in chaos, in turning things upside down, in a sense that, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.840</a></span> | <span class="t">he talked about class struggle, which came out of Marxism, but he also really, his favorite work of Chinese popular fiction was the monkey king about this legendary figure who, this monkey king who could turn the heavens upside down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So he reveled in disorder and thought disorder was a way to improve things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Xi Jinping is very orderly, is very concerned with kind of stability and predictability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see them as very, very different that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Mao also liked to stir things up, liked to have people on the streets, clamoring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So Xi Jinping, even though he has a personality cult, it's not manifesting itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">He doesn't like the idea of people on the streets in anything that can't be controlled.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can, you know, there are a lot of ways that they're similar, a lot of ways they're different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.400</a></span> | <span class="t">They're also different, and this fits with this orderliness, that Xi Jinping talks positively about Confucius and Confucian traditions in China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.120</a></span> | <span class="t">And Confucian traditions are based on kind of stable hierarchies for the most part and sort of clear categories of superior and inferior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas Mao liked things to be turned upside down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=205" target="_blank">00:03:25.660</a></span> | <span class="t">He thought of Confucianism as a futile way of thought that had held China back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can come up with things that they're similar, and you can come up with things where they're really opposites.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.060</a></span> | <span class="t">But they both clearly did want to see China under rule by the Communist Party.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's been a continuity, and that connects them to the leaders in between them, too, as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's some degree, as you said, that Xi Jinping espouses the ideas of communism and the ideas of Confucianism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's go all the way back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You wrote that in order to understand the China of today, we have to study its past.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So the China of today celebrates ideas of Confucius, a Chinese philosopher who lived 2,500 years ago.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you tell me about the ideas of Confucius?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.440</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, we don't know that much about the historic Confucius.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=255" target="_blank">00:04:15.220</a></span> | <span class="t">He's around the same time as, you know, figures like Socrates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And like with Socrates, we get a lot of what we know about him or think we know about him from what his followers said</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and things that were attributed to him and dialogues that were written afterwards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, you can have a lot of fun with these sort of axial age thinkers and what they had in common.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Another thing that connects these axial age thinkers is they were trying to kind of make a case for why they should be able to educate the next generation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the elite, and sort of had a way of promising that they had philosophical ideas that helped decide how you should run a polity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Confucius lived in a time when there were these warring kingdoms in a territory that later became China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But what he said was that there had been this period of great order in the past, that the lines between inferior and superior were clear,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and there was a kind of synergy between superior and inferior that kept everything ticking along really nicely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.940</a></span> | <span class="t">He thought that hierarchical relationships were a good thing, and that the trick was that both sides in a hierarchical relationship owed something to the other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So the father and son relationship was a key one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">The father deserved respect from the son, but owed the son care and benevolence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And things would be fine as long as both sides in a relationship held up their end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And he had a whole series of these relationships.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=352" target="_blank">00:05:52.220</a></span> | <span class="t">The husband to the wife was, again, an unequal one of the husband being superior to the wife,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.940</a></span> | <span class="t">but him owing the wife care and her owing him deference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And he had the same notion that then the emperor to the ministers, these were all parallels.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And there were no egalitarian relationships in Confucianism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=374" target="_blank">00:06:14.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Even something that in the West we often think of as a kind of quintessentially egalitarian relationship between brothers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">In the Chinese tradition of Confucianism, there was only older brother and younger brother.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Brotherhood was not an egalitarian relationship.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It was one where the older brother took care of the younger brother, and the younger brother showed respect for the older brother.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=399" target="_blank">00:06:39.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So stable hierarchy was at the core of everything in society.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It permeated everything, including politics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and there was even a sense that it connected the natural world to the supernatural world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=412" target="_blank">00:06:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So the emperor was to heaven, this kind of non-personified deity, like the emperor was to the ministers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So all of this had these relationships.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So the emperor was the son of heaven.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And for Confucius, he said, so we should study the text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=433" target="_blank">00:07:13.780</a></span> | <span class="t">We should study how the sages of old behaved, that society was becoming corrupted and was going away from that sort of purity of the sages when the relationships were all in order.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So Confucianism was a kind of conservative or even backward-looking thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.300</a></span> | <span class="t">It wasn't arguing for progress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It was arguing for reclaiming a pure golden age in the past.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So it was also a kind of conservative—so in all kinds of ways, you know, it's irreconcilable to many things about Marxism and communism, which is all about struggle and all about actually a progressive view of history moving from one stage to the next.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the interesting thing about Xi Jinping and the China of today, is there is that tension of Confucianism and communism, where communism and Marxism is supposed to let go of history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And Confucianism, there's a real veneration of history that's happening in China of today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So they're able to wear both hats and balance it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=495" target="_blank">00:08:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, you could say that in many points in the 20th century, there was a kind of struggle between different competing political groups over which part of the Chinese past to connect with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Was it to the Confucian tradition or to the kind of rebellious monkey king tradition, which was what Mao connected to?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Xi Jinping and before him, to some extent, you know, Hu Jintao, we saw this a little bit at the Olympics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">There was more of this kind of mix-it-all-together view.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=527" target="_blank">00:08:47.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Anything that suggested greatness in the past could be something that could be fused together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So Xi Jinping says that, you know, Mao is one of his heroes or one of the people he looks to as a model, but so is Confucius.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's really, you know, they had so little in common, but they both, in his mind and the minds of others, suggest a kind of power and greatness of the Chinese past.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=554" target="_blank">00:09:14.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so this platonic notion of greatness, and that, you could say, connects, that's a thread that connects for Xi Jinping, the great history, multi-thousand-year history of China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=569" target="_blank">00:09:29.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and it involves smoothing out all kinds of internal contradictions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">You had, you know, the first emperor of China, jumping forward a bit, you know, in 221 BC, he is anti-scholars.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">He burns books, and he doesn't venerate these kind of rituals and things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So he was very much against the things that Confucius stood for, but, and Mao, in a sense of having to choose between Confucius and the first emperor, he said, well, maybe the first emperor had the right idea, you know, scholars can be a pain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=605" target="_blank">00:10:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So he said, like, if you have to choose between Confucianism and that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But Xi Jinping, I think, continually is kind of not choosing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And if he wants to say, well, look at the great wall, look at this wonderful, in fact, that was a symbol of kind of strength and domination related to the first emperor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Who, by the way, didn't build anything like the great wall you see today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=627" target="_blank">00:10:27.160</a></span> | <span class="t">He built walls, and they were fine, you know, they were good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But the great wall itself didn't come into being until many centuries later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But still, this idea of anything that suggests a kind of greatness is something that, as a, in many ways, a nationalist above all else, Xi Jinping is a supporter of the party and single-party rule.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.840</a></span> | <span class="t">That's something he clearly believes in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=650" target="_blank">00:10:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And he's a nationalist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.880</a></span> | <span class="t">He wants to see China be great and acknowledge this great on the world stage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Boy, so many contradictions always.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So, Stalin, he was a communist, but also a nationalist, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.180</a></span> | <span class="t">That contradiction is, is, is, is, uh, also permeates through, through Mao and all the way to Xi Jinping.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you can linger on Confucius for a little bit, you write that one of the most famous statements of Confucianism is the belief that, quote,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.940</a></span> | <span class="t">people are pretty much alike at birth, but become differentiated via learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this sets the tradition that China places a high value on education and on meritocracy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=691" target="_blank">00:11:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Can you speak to this Confucius' idea of education and how much does it permeate to the China of today?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So, there's an optimism to this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">There's an optimism in the sense of a ability that people can be good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And when exposed to exemplary figures from the past, they'll want to be like those exemplary figures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it was a form of education through kind of emulation of models and study of past figures and past texts that were exemplary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And it, and it was, it did have this, this idea, uh, relatively positive view of human nature and the sort of changeability of humans through, um, through education.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that, um, that shows through in all kinds of things, even the fact that while there were lots of killings by the Chinese Communist Party and other groups, there was often an idea that, um, that people could be, could be remolded potentially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And China was one of the few places where they didn't kill the, um, the last emperor, you know, the last emperor, the idea was that he could become, anybody could be kind of turned into a citizen of this or a subject of this, a good, a good member of this polity through the kind of, um, education.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And often it was a very kind of forceful form of education, but I think that's a carryover from, from the Confucian times and, um, over time, this Confucian idea led to the creation of, uh, one of the early great civil service exams and idea that bureaucracy should be run not by people who were born into the right families, but ones who had shown their ability to master these fairly intensive kind of exams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=810" target="_blank">00:13:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And the exams were things that could make or break your career a bit like at some points in the American past, passing a bar exam, a really intensive thing could, could set you on the road to, to a good career in China, you had the civil service exam tradition.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think this kind of emphasis on, on, on education and on, uh, valuing of scholarly pursuits, but then Chinese leaders throughout history, including up to Mao and Xi Jinping have also found scholars to be, uh, tremendously difficult to control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's an ambivalence to it or contradiction again, there, but, uh, to which degree this idea of meritocracy that's inherent to the notion that we all start at the same line, there's a meritocratic view of human nature there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Or if you work hard and you, uh, learn things, you will succeed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=870" target="_blank">00:14:30.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the reverse, if you haven't succeeded, that means you didn't work hard enough or do not deserve the spoils of the, of the success.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, does that carry over to the China today?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">There's such a challenge in all these forms of meritocracy because, you know, you had the civil service exams, but the question was who, if you, if you had a really good tutor, if you could afford a really good tutor, you had a better chance of passing the exams.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, one thing that happened there was families would, would pool together resources to try to help the, the brightest in their group to be able to become part of the officialdom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and this kind of pooling together resources to help as a family was, was an important part of that structure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=916" target="_blank">00:15:16.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But there also was a kind of, um, there was always a tension of that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so what if you don't succeed?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Some of the leaders of rebellions against, um, against emperors were failed examination candidates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.940</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, this, this, you, you, you had this issue and then it became something, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=938" target="_blank">00:15:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">the system was out of whack and it needed a new, a new leader.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and also there was a, there was something built in that was not so much Confucius himself, but one of his main, um, main interpreters, early interpreters, Mencius, had this idea, which can be seen as a crude justification for rebellion or for a kind of democracy to say that even though the emperor rules at the, the will of heaven,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=968" target="_blank">00:16:08.060</a></span> | <span class="t">if, if, if he doesn't act like a true emperor, if he's not morally upstanding, then heaven will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.600</a></span> | <span class="t">remove his, uh, heaven will remove its, its mandate to him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there's, if it's, if it's, if the rebellion isn't justified, then heaven will stop the ruler from being killed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=994" target="_blank">00:16:34.060</a></span> | <span class="t">but if heaven has removed his, uh, support, then the rebellion will succeed and then a new, um, a new ruler will be justified in taking power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a, it's an interesting sense that the, the universe in this Confucian view has a kind of moral dimension to it, but it also, um, it's when things actually happen that you see where the side of morality is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1023" target="_blank">00:17:03.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. So it's meritocracy with an asterisk. It does seem to be the case. Maybe you can speak to that, that in the Chinese education system, there seems to be a high value for excellence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, hopefully I'm not generalizing too much, but from the things I've seen, there are certain cultures, certain peoples that, you know, it's just part of the value system of the culture that you need to be a really good student.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that the case with the China of today?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1051" target="_blank">00:17:31.540</a></span> | <span class="t">There's been a lot of emphasis on, um, on education and sort of working really hard and excelling at, at some subjects and having, um, you know, there isn't the civil service exam, but there is, um, the gaokao, an exam that really can determine where you get, what kind of, um, institution to get into.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1073" target="_blank">00:17:53.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think, you know, getting back to this idea of, of meritocracy, which, which is strong in a lot of, um, in a lot of tradition, it also a kind of, um, what it opens you up to is when there is a sense of unfairness and who's getting ahead and how the spoils are being divided.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1094" target="_blank">00:18:14.900</a></span> | <span class="t">This leads to a kind of outrage and some of the biggest protests in, in China have been about this sense of nepotism, which really seems to subvert this whole, um, idea of kind of meritocracy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1111" target="_blank">00:18:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And the, the 1989 protest at Tiananmen, even though kind of in the, the Western press in particular, it was discussed as a movement for democracy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1120" target="_blank">00:18:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But a lot of the first posters that went up that got students really angry were criticisms of corruption within the communist party and nepotism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1128" target="_blank">00:18:48.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And the sense that people, despite all the talk, I mean, despite the fact that most people seem to be having to study really hard to pass these exams, to get, uh, good positions in universities, that some of them were being handed out via the kind of back door.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And that led to a kind of outrage, not, I mean, that's true in, in, in many places, but I think it gives a special, a special anger against nepotism because of that, um, the way in which so much emphasis is put on kind of the standard exam way of, of getting ahead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1161" target="_blank">00:19:21.320</a></span> | <span class="t">I hope it's okay if we jump around through history a bit and find the threads that connect everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1166" target="_blank">00:19:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Since you mentioned Tiananmen Square, you have studied a lot of student protests throughout Chinese history, throughout history in general.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.340</a></span> | <span class="t">What happened in Tiananmen Square?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1177" target="_blank">00:19:37.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So in 1989, this massive movement took place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1182" target="_blank">00:19:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">The story of it's largely suppressed within China and largely misunderstood, um, in other places, in part because it happened around the same time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1190" target="_blank">00:19:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">That communism was unraveling and ending in the, the former Soviet bloc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1196" target="_blank">00:19:56.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think it's often conflated with what was going on there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1199" target="_blank">00:19:59.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so I think one of the key things to know about the protests in 1989 was that they were an effort to get the communist party in China to do a better job of living up to its own stated ideals and to try to support, uh, the trend within the party toward a kind of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.640</a></span> | <span class="t">liberalizing, um, liberalizing, um, liberalizing and opening up form, uh, that, that had taken shape after Mao's death.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1230" target="_blank">00:20:30.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And in a sense, the student generation of 89, and I was there in 86 when there were some sort of warmup protests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">There was a kind of frustration with what they felt was, um, um, a half-assed version of what they were talking about, that the, the government was saying, the party was saying, we believe in reforming and opening up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We need to liberalize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1254" target="_blank">00:20:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">We need to give people more, um, more control of, of their fate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1259" target="_blank">00:20:59.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And the students felt that this was being done more effectively in the economic realm than in the political realm, and that there were a lot of sort of partial gestures that, that suggested, um, the party needed to be pressed to really, really move in that direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's, it'll seem like a very trivial thing, but I found it fascinating in 86 when I was there in Shanghai in late 86, and students protested.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1288" target="_blank">00:21:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this was the first time that students had been really on the streets in significant numbers since the Cultural Revolution, or at least since 76.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1296" target="_blank">00:21:36.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and the students were inspired by calls for democracy and discussions of democracy by this, um, uh, this physicist, Fang Li-Jer, who was a kind of, um, often thought it was a Chinese Sakharov.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1310" target="_blank">00:21:50.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, he was a liberalizing intellectual.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1312" target="_blank">00:21:52.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But one of the things that students in Shanghai, which were some of the most intense protests of that year took place, were frustrated about, was a rock concert, of all things, that, um, Jan and Dean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1325" target="_blank">00:22:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">the American surf rock band, which was kind of like the Beach Boys, only not as big.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1330" target="_blank">00:22:10.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And they were, um, touring China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1332" target="_blank">00:22:12.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It was the first time in Shanghai that there'd been a rock concert, and the students were really excited about this, because this fit in with what they thought the Communist Party was moving toward, was letting them be more part of the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1344" target="_blank">00:22:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And for them, that meant being more in step with pop culture around the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the concert, some students got up to dance, because that's what they knew you were supposed to do at a rock concert.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1355" target="_blank">00:22:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And the security guards made them sit down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1357" target="_blank">00:22:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And for the students in Shanghai, this sort of symbolized what was, you know, a feint toward openness that really didn't have follow-through.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1365" target="_blank">00:22:45.700</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to give you rock concerts, but not let you dance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1369" target="_blank">00:22:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so the protests went on for a little while in 86, and, um, posters went up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1374" target="_blank">00:22:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The officials at, at, um, universities said, no, this is out of hand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1380" target="_blank">00:23:00.340</a></span> | <span class="t">We had chaos on the streets during the Cultural Revolution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1383" target="_blank">00:23:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">We can't go back to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1384" target="_blank">00:23:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And nobody wanted to go back to that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1386" target="_blank">00:23:06.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So there were posters I saw that said, this is new Red Guardism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1391" target="_blank">00:23:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and the students didn't want to be associated with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1394" target="_blank">00:23:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So it wound down pretty quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And they, they, they thought, you know, we're not like the Red Guards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1400" target="_blank">00:23:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">We don't want to make chaos.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1402" target="_blank">00:23:22.060</a></span> | <span class="t">We also are not fervent loyalists of anybody in power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1405" target="_blank">00:23:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">The Red Guards had been, you know, passionate about Mao.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1408" target="_blank">00:23:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">The, the, the analogy partly sort of scared them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1411" target="_blank">00:23:31.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And also it meant that the government was really serious about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.680</a></span> | <span class="t">uh, dealing with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1415" target="_blank">00:23:35.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So then in 1989, this protest, the protests restart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1419" target="_blank">00:23:39.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are a variety of reasons why they can restart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.220</a></span> | <span class="t">They, the space for them, students are thinking about doing something in 1989.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1429" target="_blank">00:23:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a very resonant year, 200th anniversary of the French Revolution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1434" target="_blank">00:23:54.080</a></span> | <span class="t">People are thinking about that, but more importantly, it's the 70th anniversary of the biggest student</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1439" target="_blank">00:23:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">movement in Chinese history, the May 4th movement of 1919.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1444" target="_blank">00:24:04.240</a></span> | <span class="t">And the May 4th movement had helped lay the groundwork for the Chinese Communist Party.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1448" target="_blank">00:24:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Some member, leading founders of it had been student activists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1452" target="_blank">00:24:12.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Then it was an anti-imperialist movement, but it was also, um, a movement against bad government.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1458" target="_blank">00:24:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so the students thought, you know, the anniversary of that movement was always marked,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">commemorated in China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1466" target="_blank">00:24:26.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And people took the series, the history seriously.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1469" target="_blank">00:24:29.500</a></span> | <span class="t">People were reminded of what students did in the past.</span></div><div

why people were itching to do something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1478" target="_blank">00:24:38.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, um, um, a leader, Pu Yaobang, who was associated with the more kind of reformist,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1487" target="_blank">00:24:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">more liberalizing, um, group within the Chinese Communist Party.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1491" target="_blank">00:24:51.700</a></span> | <span class="t">He had been stripped of a very high office, demoted after taking, partly taking a fairly light stance toward the 86-87 protests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1501" target="_blank">00:25:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And so he was still a member of the government, but he was not as high up in power.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1506" target="_blank">00:25:06.580</a></span> | <span class="t">He had been very high up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1507" target="_blank">00:25:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">He had been sort of Deng Xiaoping's potential successor.</span></div><div

for him, because he dies still as an official.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1517" target="_blank">00:25:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And the students take advantage of the opening of their having to be, um, having to be commemorations of his death.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1525" target="_blank">00:25:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And they put up posters that basically say the wrong people are dying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1529" target="_blank">00:25:29.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, Pu Yaobang was younger than some of the more conservative members.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1533" target="_blank">00:25:33.460</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:26:17.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a lot of frustration at this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1580" target="_blank">00:26:20.560</a></span> | <span class="t">There are also economic frustrations at this point.</span></div><div class="c"><span

that people with good government connections,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1590" target="_blank">00:26:30.480</a></span> | <span

class="t">And so it's, there's sort of a sense of unfairness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1596" target="_blank">00:26:36.060</a></span> | <span class="t">The students are also really frustrated by the kind of macro managing of their private lives on campuses.</span></div><div class="c"><span

country and other cities as well become this mix of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1610" target="_blank">00:26:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an anti-corruption movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1612" target="_blank">00:26:52.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a call for more democracy movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1614" target="_blank">00:26:54.680</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a call for more freedom of speech movement, but it's also a kind of, um, has some counterculture elements that are like, there are rock concerts on the square.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1623" target="_blank">00:27:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">The most popular, uh, rock musician, Sui Jien, comes to the square and is, um, celebrated when he's there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1631" target="_blank">00:27:11.640</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a sense of kind of a variety of things rolled into one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1635" target="_blank">00:27:15.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and I, I, I brought up how it sort of gets conflated with the movements to overthrow communism and the Eastern bloc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1643" target="_blank">00:27:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It was actually in many ways, I think more like something that happened in the Eastern bloc 20 years earlier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1649" target="_blank">00:27:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It was more like Prague spring and other 1968 protests in the communist bloc, which was about moving toward socialism with a human face, more like trying to get the parties to empower to reform rather than necessarily doing away with them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1666" target="_blank">00:27:46.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, so there was a kind of disjuncture happened at the same time as moves to, to end communism, but of course, I would say there was a possibility when all the protesters were on the square.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1677" target="_blank">00:27:57.340</a></span> | <span class="t">It seemed that for a time that this might be seen as an acceptable kind of movement movement to just have a kind of course correction, but then there's also an internal struggle within the communist party leadership.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1690" target="_blank">00:28:10.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And clearly the people who are more political conservatives, even if they believe in economic reform are clearly getting the upper hand and they're, this is not going to be tolerated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1702" target="_blank">00:28:22.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And the students stay on the square when signals are given to try to get them out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1708" target="_blank">00:28:28.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Students from around the country are pouring into, to Beijing to join this movement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1713" target="_blank">00:28:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">They don't want to end the movement when they've just arrived.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1716" target="_blank">00:28:36.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's actually one thing that keeps it going is new, new, um, participants are coming from the provinces.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1722" target="_blank">00:28:42.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And even if some moderates want to leave the square, people want to stay and then workers start joining in the movement as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1730" target="_blank">00:28:50.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And form a independent labor union.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And that really the, the Chinese communist party, to a certain extent, they might put up with student protesters, but they know from past experience that sometimes student protests lead to, to members of other social classes joining them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1749" target="_blank">00:29:09.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's important because they look up to students as sort of potential intellectual leaders of the country and admiration for scholars is part of this that turns people turn out when students protest something very different from the American case where there's a kind of often suspicious of American, of student activists being necessarily on the same side as, as everybody else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1771" target="_blank">00:29:31.260</a></span> | <span class="t">: But in China, there had been from the history of the 20th century, a sense of students as potentially a vanguard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1780" target="_blank">00:29:40.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So once there are, um, labor activists joining the movement, then troops are called in and there's a massacre near Tiananmen Square, um, on the middle of the night of June 3rd and early June 4th.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1794" target="_blank">00:29:54.260</a></span> | <span class="t">And the, the, the army just moves in and begins behaving very much like an army of occupation, which is something that people civilization of armies is, is supposed to be the one that saves China from foreign aggression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1808" target="_blank">00:30:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And they're acting like an invading force.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1811" target="_blank">00:30:11.300</a></span> | <span class="t">: So this is where famously the tanks rolling, the tanks roll in, and I think also you would have that famous image of the man standing in front of the tank, that's a band image within China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1821" target="_blank">00:30:21.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And I really think the reason why it's so considered so toxic by the regime is because it just shows the people's liberation army looking like an invading force, not like a stabilizing force.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1835" target="_blank">00:30:35.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: Can we talk about that? Who's not called the tank man? The man that stood in front of the row of tanks. This was on June 5th in Tiananmen Square. What do we know about him? What do you think about him? The symbolism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1850" target="_blank">00:30:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: It's a, it's an amazing symbol. Um, you know, he's on this boulevard near the square with this long line of tanks and it's unquestionably this act of incredible bravery. And there's some interesting things about it. Some that are forgotten.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1864" target="_blank">00:31:04.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: One is that in the end he climbs up on the tank and the tank swerves, you know, it doesn't run him over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1871" target="_blank">00:31:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And the Chinese Communist Party initially showed video of this and said, look, the Western press is talking about how vicious we were, but look at the restraint, look at this. He wasn't mowed down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1882" target="_blank">00:31:22.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And they tried this whole story with Tiananmen initially of saying, look, the students were out of control. This, everybody should remember what happened during the Cultural Revolution.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1891" target="_blank">00:31:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And the army showed restraint. And there were a small number of soldiers who were actually burned alive in their, in their tanks during, once the massacre began, people got outraged and they attacked the soldiers. But by selective use of footage, the Communist Party could say, look, actually look at this. The, the heroes, the martyrs were these soldiers. And they try for the first months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1920" target="_blank">00:32:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: Months after it to, to try to get this narrative to stick. They talk about Tiananmen a lot. They talk about these things. They show images of the tank man.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1927" target="_blank">00:32:07.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: The problem with it is that lots and lots of people around Beijing had seen what happened and knew that in fact, there first been the firing on unarmed civilians with automatic weapons. And then, and there had been many, many people, some students, but a lot of ordinary Beijing, Beijing residents and workers who were just mowed down. So lots of people knew somebody who had been killed. So that story just didn't work. And then I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1928" target="_blank">00:32:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: The, the, the, the, the problem with it is that lots and lots of people around Beijing had seen what happened and knew that in fact, there first been the firing on unarmed civilians with automatic weapons. And then, and there had been many, many people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1943" target="_blank">00:32:23.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: Some students, you know, some students, but a lot of ordinary Beijing, Beijing residents and workers who were just mowed down. So lots of people knew somebody who had been killed. So that story just didn't work. And then I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1955" target="_blank">00:32:35.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: The, the, the, the, the claim had to be made to try to try to suppress discussion of the event and particularly to this, to repress that visual imagery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1967" target="_blank">00:32:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: That was that image of the man in front of a line of tanks, whatever the tanks did do him or not, the main takeaway from it would be this idea that there were lines of tanks in a city.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1980" target="_blank">00:33:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: That was, um, that the, the image was of the government as having lost the mandate to rule. And they really didn't want to have that image, um, out there in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=1992" target="_blank">00:33:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: Yeah. We're watching the video now. He's got what like grocery bags in his hands. It's such a symbolic. I've had enough. Like that kind of statement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2007" target="_blank">00:33:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: Yeah. And it's probably not a student, you know, it's often described as a student, but he probably was, um, a worker and it is, it is a powerful, powerful image of bravery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2017" target="_blank">00:33:37.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And, you know, I brought up the 1968 parallel for Eastern and Central Europe. There was actually a very powerful photograph of a man bearing his chest in front of a tank in Bratislava during, um, what we think of as Prague spring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2033" target="_blank">00:33:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: That was a famous image of bravery against tanks. And in 1968 in Czechoslovakia, then still Czechoslovakia, the tanks that rolled in were Soviet tanks sent down there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2047" target="_blank">00:34:07.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And so not that people would know, but that was an image, you know, what was so powerful in that was saying, we're not going to put up with this invasion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2057" target="_blank">00:34:17.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: Again, I think you have the people's liberation of army, army looking like an invading force. And that's what, um, that's what the Chinese Communist Party in a sense can't, can't deal with now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2069" target="_blank">00:34:29.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: Even though sometimes they could tell a story about 1989, and they do tell a version of this and some people believe this, I think, is that in 1989, China went one route of not, um, not having the Communist Party dramatically change or relinquish control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2089" target="_blank">00:34:49.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And the Soviet Union and the former Soviet states went another. And you could say, well, look, and after 1989, the Chinese economy boomed. Life got better for people in China. Life got really terrible for a lot of people in the former Soviet blocs. Maybe we actually, maybe this was the right way to go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2107" target="_blank">00:35:07.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And you can make that kind of argument. But if you show the tanks and the man in front of the tanks, you, you, you just have a different kind of image of heroism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2116" target="_blank">00:35:16.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: It's one of my favorite photographs or snapshots ever taken videos ever taken. So I apologize if we linger on it. Sometimes you don't understand the symbolic power of an image until afterwards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2132" target="_blank">00:35:32.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And perhaps that's what the Chinese government didn't quite understand. They lost information more than mean more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2138" target="_blank">00:35:38.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: So I, I have to ask, what do you think was going through that man's head? Was it a heroic statement? Was it a purely primal, guttural, like I've had enough?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2149" target="_blank">00:35:49.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: It's so interesting to just speculate. And we just don't know because, you know, he was never able to be interviewed afterwards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2155" target="_blank">00:35:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: But I think your emphasis on patriotism is really important because one of the students' main demands was then, I think it might've been the thing that would have gotten them to leave the square would have been to say, you, we want this to be acknowledged as a patriotic, that our goals are patriotic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2171" target="_blank">00:36:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: We're not here to take China back into the cultural revolution. We're here, we're here to express our love for the country if it goes in the right way. So will you admit that? And you mentioned about the power of the image.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2185" target="_blank">00:36:25.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And I do think the Chinese Communist Party learned something, has taken to heart the power of the image after that, because we saw this in, but when there were protests in Hong Kong, the government on the mainland really wanted to tell a story there of, you know, crowds out of control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2204" target="_blank">00:36:44.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And initially there were in 2014, and again, initially in 2019, there were very orderly crowds, and it had trouble with that story.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2214" target="_blank">00:36:54.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: So they tried very hard to ban images of peaceful protests until there were some incidents, as there almost always are, of violence by crowds. And then they would show those images over and over again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2228" target="_blank">00:37:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: They also worked very hard when Hong Kong protests began in the 2010s to try very hard to avoid any use of soldiers to repress them. It was all the police.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2240" target="_blank">00:37:20.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And they tried very hard and managed to success, because the Western press was often saying, "Will this be another Tiananmen? Will there be a massacre? Will there be soldiers on the streets?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2251" target="_blank">00:37:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: The movements in Hong Kong were suppressed without the use of shooting to kill on the streets. They were shooting to wound, there was beanbags shot, there were rubber bullets, there was enormous amounts of tear gas, there was even tear gas let fly inside subway stations in 2019.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2274" target="_blank">00:37:54.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And all these things are really brutalizing, but they don't make the kind of images that sear in the mind the way something like the Tiananmen tank man image,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2286" target="_blank">00:38:06.780</a></span> | <span class="t">or the image of a Vietnamese woman being burned by napalm, a young woman that became another of the iconic images during the Vietnam War. Those images really can have an extraordinary power.

It's much more just remove them, imprison them. But the Tank Man, there was never a trial. There was never even a trial that was one that you knew what the result would be, which there was for Liu Xiaobo and others. Not even a hidden trial, but simply disappeared.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2378" target="_blank">00:39:38.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And there's been somebody who's like another figure like this who's disappeared.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2384" target="_blank">00:39:44.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: A couple of years ago in Beijing, there was a lone man who put up a banner on a bridge,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2392" target="_blank">00:39:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: Sitong Bridge in Beijing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2394" target="_blank">00:39:54.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And it was extraordinary.

And the banner somehow he managed to have it up and get it long enough to be filmed and to draw attention and the film to circulate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2414" target="_blank">00:40:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: Again, another image of the power of images. And he's disappeared. And there hasn't been a show trial or even a secret trial. And again, you know, we don't know if he's still alive, but these are cases where I think the Chinese Communist Party really doesn't want a competing story out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2432" target="_blank">00:40:32.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: They don't want somebody to be able to answer what he was thinking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2436" target="_blank">00:40:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: How much censorship is there in modern day China by the Chinese government?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2442" target="_blank">00:40:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: So, you know, there's a lot of censorship. My favorite book about one of my favorite books about Chinese censorship, Margaret Roberts, where she talks about there are three different ways that the government can control the stories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2455" target="_blank">00:40:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And she says there's fear, which is this kind of direct censorship thing, like banning things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2461" target="_blank">00:41:01.780</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's also friction, which she says, she has three apps: fear, friction and flooding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2466" target="_blank">00:41:06.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And she says they're all important.

And in fact, in 1949, Orwell sent his former teacher a copy of 1984 and said, "Look, I've written this."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2731" target="_blank">00:45:31.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: "This place is yours." He didn't say that. He just said, "I want you to have this." But he had criticized Brave New World and reviews as not having imagined a world of capitalism run wild like before realizing the kind of totalitarian threats of the middle of the 20th century.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2753" target="_blank">00:45:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: But Huxley wrote Orwell a letter in October of 1949, same month the Communist Party took control in China, not that he mentions China.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2761" target="_blank">00:46:01.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And he just said, "You know, it's a great book and everything, but I think the dictators of the future will find less arduous ways to keep control over the population."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2771"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2776" target="_blank">00:46:16.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: I have to say, I think Huxley might be really onto something there, truly a visionary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2783" target="_blank">00:46:23.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Although to give points to Orwell, I do think as far as just a philosophical work of fiction, 1984 is a better book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2795" target="_blank">00:46:35.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: Because Brave New World does not quite construct the philosophical message thoroughly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2800" target="_blank">00:46:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Because 1984 contains many very clearly, very poetically defined elements of a totalitarian regime.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2808" target="_blank">00:46:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: Oh, and the

you've got a point there, and I went back and reread Brave New World, and it's fascinating, but it's very messy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2819" target="_blank">00:46:59.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2820" target="_blank">00:47:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: I think there's a clarity to Orwell's 1984, there's a clarity to Margaret Atwood's Handmaid's Tale, similarly, the construction of the elements.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2831"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2839" target="_blank">00:47:19.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: But, you know, there was a kind of, it's not exactly a sequel, but Huxley did write something called Brave New World Revisited.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2846" target="_blank">00:47:26.780</a></span> |

<span class="t">: And it's a box set where you have Zemiatin's We, who then inspired both Orwell and Huxley to some extent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2879" target="_blank">00:47:59.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: That's one book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

it was published in Complex Characters, you could buy it in Hong Kong, but I compared it to the book you can buy on the mainland.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2899" target="_blank">00:48:19.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And it's all the same, except the parts in Brave New World Revisited that refer to China are scalpeled out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2907" target="_blank">00:48:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And this, I think, shows the subtlety of the censorship system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2912" target="_blank">00:48:32.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: You can buy these books and you can read about them, but the parts that really show you how to connect the dots, that gets taken out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2921" target="_blank">00:48:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And I do think the Brave New World side of things, I think, with China, I was feeling it was definitely moving more toward Brave New World, except Tibet and Xinjiang being more the crude, boot-on-the-face 1984 style of control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2939" target="_blank">00:48:59.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: But then during the COVID lockdowns, when people were being so intensely monitored and controlled, even places like Shanghai, that it seemed much more the Brave New World kind of style, had their Orwellian moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2952" target="_blank">00:49:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: So you have it, now I think it's, you know, there are more 1984, more Brave New World parts of the country, and there are also more Brave New World, more 1984 moments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2962" target="_blank">00:49:22.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: I see why it could give a sense, after you've thoroughly internalized the fear that you have complete freedom of speech, just don't mention the government.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2973" target="_blank">00:49:33.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: So you could talk about totalitarianism, you could talk about the darkest aspects of human nature, just don't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2981" target="_blank">00:49:41.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: You can even talk about the government in a sort of metaphorical, like poetic way that's not directly linkable.</span></div><div

a dumb keyword search.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=2994" target="_blank">00:49:54.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: It's, yeah, it's, and I think it's like one of these really good examples of how, you know, China's distinctive, but it's not unique.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3004" target="_blank">00:50:04.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: Like you have other settings where you have these, like, no-go zones that you

Singapore, you know, there was this, so National University of Singapore has a world-class history department, but no Singapore historian in it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3019" target="_blank">00:50:19.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: Nobody who focuses on the history of Singapore, because, you know, it's incredibly

<span class="t">: But when you're actually talking about the family that's been most powerful in Singapore, then it gets to be touchy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">00:50:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And so you, in all of these settings, you have to figure out ways to work around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3115" target="_blank">00:51:55.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: because I was just curious about like what the culture in this Foreign

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3147" target="_blank">00:52:27.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: the ability of the individual mind to compartmentalize things.</span></div><div

Even, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3516" target="_blank">00:58:36.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: it's more porous than in North Korea, things like that.

I mean, fundamentally, the human spirit is curious and wants to understand.

I often enjoy talking to people from different backgrounds, from different parts of the world,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3632" target="_blank">01:00:32.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: talking to them about World War Two. Because it's like, it's clear that the emphasis, you've read certain chapters of the story,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3642" target="_blank">01:00:42.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: a lot of times, and not the other chapters of the story. Now, the Western Front in Europe, and the Eastern Front in Europe, and then Japan and China's role in World War Two, and the history around that, before and after World War Two, of China, is not often talked about in the United States.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3658" target="_blank">01:00:58.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And I'm sure, if I can venture a guess, that the opposite is true in China. I certainly know the opposite was true in the Soviet Union, and even in Europe,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3668" target="_blank">01:01:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: that directly experienced France, Great Britain, Germany, Italy. They all have very different ways of speaking and thinking and reading about World War Two. And the same goes across all of history and all of culture. So, yes, it's always good to sort of question the mainstream narrative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3676" target="_blank">01:01:16.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: In your country, and looking outside, it's just harder to do in China, based on technological, based on all the reasons you mentioned. And if I can, I just want to give a shout out. Thank you. I'll look at her work, Margaret Roberts, the fear of the friction and the flooding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3690" target="_blank">01:01:30.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: Her ideas, I can really tell there's a lot of brilliance here. Fear, this is the most traditional form involving overt threats and punishments for accessing and sharing sensitive information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3704" target="_blank">01:01:44.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: However, Roberts finds that fear-based censorship is used selectively, mainly targeting high-profile individuals such as journalists or activists. For the average citizen, the risk of punishment is relatively low, and fear alone is not the main deterrent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3716" target="_blank">01:01:56.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: She goes on to describe the friction and the flooding. The friction is a tax on information access. And flooding is less visible than fear or friction, but is a powerful tool for shaping the information environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3734" target="_blank">01:02:14.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: Flooding once scares me more and more. Flooding once scares me more and more. Flooding once is the brave new world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3752" target="_blank">01:02:32.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: Yeah, it is. And I think it's a whole kind of the world of short attention spans and social media and how this all works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3760" target="_blank">01:02:40.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: Chinese Communist Party leaders, I brought up Singapore, and Deng Xiaoping and some of the other leaders were looking at that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3767" target="_blank">01:02:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: There are all kinds of things that both going to Singapore can sometimes make you feel like you're in this futuristic setting in terms of a lot of things that eventually came to other parts of the world would be tried out there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3786" target="_blank">01:03:06.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And I think the seductiveness is that some of these things are really--they both add to convenience at the same time they strip away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3795" target="_blank">01:03:15.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: Mm-hmm. : They're collecting information about you, which can be also something that can make your life easier at the same time it's stripping you away of--I mean, we talk about the siloing of information and targeting of ads and targeting of news.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3813" target="_blank">01:03:33.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And so two things come to mind to mention. One is Christina Larson, a very bright journalist, a friend of mine who's now working on other things but was working on China, and she wrote about this in MIT Technology Review.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3828" target="_blank">01:03:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: She said, "You need to think about China as having the best as well as the worst internet experience in the world."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3833" target="_blank">01:03:53.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And, you know, you think about it with--you think of the worst as easy, you know, the Great Firewall, you try to search for what happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3841" target="_blank">01:04:01.780</a></span> | <span class="t">You search for the tank man, you won't get it.

Like, I said, "Oh, we've got such and such."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3886" target="_blank">01:04:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And I said, "Oh, that's like Yelp."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3888" target="_blank">01:04:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: I said, "Well, yeah, but Yelp just tells you the overall rating for a restaurant over time."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3894" target="_blank">01:04:54.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: We've got one that can tell you who's--which part of the restaurant you want to sit in because there's a waiter that's in a really bad mood and people have posted enough information to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3904" target="_blank">01:05:04.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: Or, you know, what the best dish there is in the last week.

You had way before--you go into an underground parking lot now in the U.S.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3930" target="_blank">01:05:30.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And you find out whether there are any empty spaces on a floor.

So the other line besides Best and Worst Internet I always like is William Gibson, who wrote one of the other important dystopian novels of the present Neuromancer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3961" target="_blank">01:06:01.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And he wrote a rare, for him, nonfiction piece about Singapore where he referred to it as Disneyland with the death penalty.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3968" target="_blank">01:06:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And, you know, there are times when--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3971" target="_blank">01:06:11.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: I shouldn't laugh.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=3972" target="_blank">01:06:12.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: But it is.

It's this kind of like, you do certain kinds of behaviors, and we're seeing this other places too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4012" target="_blank">01:06:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: You know, we're seeing versions of it in the US as well, where it's like, oh, we can tell from a pattern that you're the kind of person who might do X.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4020" target="_blank">01:07:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And so in Xinjiang, they were--when they were starting to round people up, there's this great book by a Uyghur poet, he talks about how people were just starting to disappear off the streets, and they were being accused of being radicalized and being potential terrorists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4039" target="_blank">01:07:19.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: And the cues could be something like somebody giving up smoking or not drinking alcohol, because that was seen as something that sometimes went along with becoming more devoted to Islam and more devoted to something, a particular version of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4058" target="_blank">01:07:38.780</a></span> | <span class="t">: So he talked about how a group of the poets, when they would get--writers, when they get together, they would--whether or not any of them drank, they would make sure there was a bottle of alcohol on their table,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4067" target="_blank">01:07:47.780</a></span> | <span class="t">because it was simply a way of trying to stay ahead of this system of looking for these kind of clues. So you really have this dark side of Xinjiang is this example, and Tibet also, with incredible tight control. And there's more of that kind of push on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4088" target="_blank">01:08:08.760</a></span> | <span class="t">: personal life in other parts of China as well. But I think the question of whether we give up too much and who can abuse what we do give up is something that is being asked in the United States now about big tech companies as well. It's asked about governments, but it's also asked about big tech and what you have as a trade-off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4107" target="_blank">01:08:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">: But I hadn't thought about it until this conversation, which I can tell is why people find it stimulating to have these extended conversations, because you have set lines, but then you kind of--the conversation goes and you think in a different way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4126" target="_blank">01:08:46.760</a></span> | <span class="t">: So what I used to always say about China after 1989 was the Chinese Communist Party wanted to stay in power, and they realized that the Soviet Union, Soviet bloc, was falling apart. They knew that one reason why people--and this is like the simple way of--one way I think you have to understand why communism fell in Eastern Europe--was partly about ideals and thirst for freedom and that, but also people knew that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4156" target="_blank">01:09:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">: East Germans knew that West Germans were having more fun and getting better stuff. And when some East Berliners got over the wall, one of the first places they went to was this department store to see if the images of better food and more choices were available there. And it was true. And I think this is a human--as human as the desire for more freedom.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4178" target="_blank">01:09:38.740</a></span> | <span class="t">: So one of the things that the Chinese Communist Party--they never articulated it this way, but how can we try to get to a stage where we don't have things like Tiananmen again? Well, what if we tried to make a deal with people? We'll give them more choices in their daily life. We'll give them better stuff. We'll give them more choices at the store. We'll give them more choices about what to read, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4200" target="_blank">01:10:00.740</a></span> | <span class="t">: Because, you know, we'll give them more choices in consumer goods and intellectuals. The consumer goods they want are to watch the movies and read the books that other people like them around the world are reading.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4210" target="_blank">01:10:10.740</a></span> | <span class="t">: So we'll give them more choices. We won't open the floodgates completely, but we'll give them more choices, but not give them more choices at the ballot box or in politics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4218" target="_blank">01:10:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">: And this was the new kind of new social compact. Allow us to keep ruling and we'll make sure that you're living better than the last generation in terms of choices and in terms of material goods.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4236" target="_blank">01:10:36.740</a></span> | <span class="t">: Now, one of the things that's happening now is the Chinese Communist Party, the economy isn't booming the way it was before. The sort of sense of clearly we're living better materially than the generation before, it's not as easy an argument to make when you have slower growth rates and things like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4256" target="_blank">01:10:56.740</a></span> | <span class="t">: But the Communist Party makes different kinds of arguments now about the rest of the world is in chaos and we're stable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4264" target="_blank">01:11:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">: But the thing that I now am going to think about differently is the argument was we'll give you more choices and you'll have more of a private life, more of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4276" target="_blank">01:11:16.740</a></span> | <span class="t">: But now, in the period we are globally, now there's a new kind of suspicion about the degree of any kind of private choices.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4286" target="_blank">01:11:26.740</a></span> | <span class="t">: I mean, there was an idea that the post Tiananmen generation was promised to have a little bit more space away from the prying eyes of the state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4296" target="_blank">01:11:36.740</a></span> | <span class="t">: And now, globally, we worry about the prying eyes of whether it's the state or whether it's tech companies. It's a different moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4306" target="_blank">01:11:46.740</a></span> | <span class="t">: What does it mean to say you have more choices?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4308" target="_blank">01:11:48.740</a></span> | <span class="t">: It's almost like you have two knobs. One is 1984 and one is Brave New World.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4312" target="_blank">01:11:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">: At first they turned up to Brave New World, more choices. And now they're turning up to 1984, keeping the choices, but turning up to 1984 with more surveillance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4322" target="_blank">01:12:02.740</a></span> | <span class="t">: So the choices you make have to be more public. Do you have a sense that the thing we've been talking about, the increase in censorship, does that predate Xi Jinping?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4335" target="_blank">01:12:15.740</a></span> | <span class="t">: Is Xi Jinping a part of that increase in censorship? Like, what is that dynamic? What role does Xi Jinping play in what China has gone through over the past, let's say, a decade and a half?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4347" target="_blank">01:12:27.740</a></span> | <span class="t">: That's a really great question. I was actually just writing a review of two books. One is called The Xi Jinping Effect, which was just a bunch of scholars, an academic volume, sort of looking at,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4360" target="_blank">01:12:40.740</a></span> | <span class="t">take this topic and that topic, how much has Xi Jinping as a person really affected it? And they come up with all kinds of answers. But there's a book I really like. Emily Fang of NPR has a new book out called,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4374" target="_blank">01:12:54.740</a></span> | <span class="t">"Let only red flowers bloom." And what she talks about, the changes in China as she was covering it from the mid-2010s on, was, and I think this really is Xi Jinping's, one of his imprimators on the country, is there's a narrowing of spaces available for variations of ways of being Chinese within the country. And this goes against the grain of a pattern of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4404" target="_blank">01:13:24.720</a></span> | <span class="t">pattern in the sort of post Tiananmen period of allowing more space for sort of civil society, but also allowing sort of way Muslims felt that they didn't have to choose between being, you know, their Muslim identity and their Chinese identity. But there's more and more of a kind of...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4422" target="_blank">01:13:42.720</a></span> | <span class="t">We see this in Xi Jinping becoming impatient with Hong Kong, where there was a way of which, okay, this is a city that's part of the PRC, but it really operates very differently. He seems to be uncomfortable with difference, I guess. He's not alone in strongmen in this way, of sort of wanting to impose a kind of singular vision of what Chinese identity means, what loyalty to the status quo means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4450" target="_blank">01:14:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">to the status quo means. And so there's been a kind of tightening of controls over all the borders. And even things, one thing Xi reported on was Mongolia, Inner Mongolia. It's been seen as an unproblematic kind of frontier area, and who cares if there was some revival of Mongolian language, but under Xi, there's been a less patience with those kinds of difference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4479" target="_blank">01:14:39.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, it's been a, there's been a, there's been more of a resurgence of patriarchy, all kinds of things have happened under him. But how much is it just him? Or how much is it also a kind of mood or group within the party? Some of these trends, I think, began before he took power in late 2012.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4499" target="_blank">01:14:59.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I think really my own feeling going to China fairly often from the mid-1990s till about 2018, was that until 2008, the year of the Olympics, year, each trip, it would feel like, oh, there's just more space, there's more breathing room for, uh, you know, it's not becoming a liberal democracy, but I would notice things that felt like, I'm surprised that that, that happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4528" target="_blank">01:15:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">That happens. That there just felt, people felt less worried about what they were saying and what they were doing. Um, that kind of trend line up until about 2008. But from the Olympics, um, and then the financial crisis after that, the Chinese Communist Party felt, I guess, more, it's still insecure, but it felt cockier in some ways. And you had, like, okay, maybe we can start.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4557" target="_blank">01:15:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Start asserting more control over things. So I think that's been stronger under Xi Jinping's time and power. And Xi was already the designated successor by 2008. He was in charge of, um, he was in charge of security for the Olympics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4573" target="_blank">01:16:13.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And the Olympics. And the Olympics was supposed to be a moment possibly of more opening up because when Seoul hosted the Olympics, South Korea became a less tightly controlled right-wing, um, dictatorship and move toward democracy. And some people were hoping the Olympics might move China that way. And it went quite the opposite.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4593" target="_blank">01:16:33.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You mentioned that you mentioned that you, we don't know the degree to which this change has to do with Xi Jinping or the party apparatus.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4601" target="_blank">01:16:41.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And that question, going back to Confucius of hierarchy and how does the power within this very strict one-party state, uh, work, what can we say? What do we know about the structure of this Communist Party apparatus? Uh, how much internal power struggle is there? How much power does Xi Jinping actually have? Is there any insight we have into the system?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4627" target="_blank">01:17:07.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So James Palmer, who worked in Beijing as a journalist and now is an editor at foreign policy, wrote an important piece a few years ago about just, we should really be straight about what a black box of the Chinese elite, elite politics are, and really not try to pretend we know more than we do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4647" target="_blank">01:17:27.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We did, used to have more of a sense of these kind of ideological factions, but also partly about different views of how much tinkering there should be with the economy and things like that. And they were also basic, partly based on personalities and personal ties. But we did have a sense you could sort of map out these kinds of rival power bases and things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4673" target="_blank">01:17:53.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And we just have much less of a sense of that under Xi Jinping. It's very hard to know other than the sort of small group around him, how it works. We don't have a major defector who says, yeah, this is how, this is how Xi Jinping, we have Xi Jinping's self-presentation and a lot of things that are then, um, said about him.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4693" target="_blank">01:18:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">There were some false expectations about him that some people thought, oh, he's going to be a reformer because his father was a liberalizing figure. And, you know, that doesn't work that way. And he does seem to care about orderliness. He does seem to care about certain things. He wants to present himself as a kind of scholarly figure in touch with China's deep past.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4714" target="_blank">01:18:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, we know he's a strong nationalist and a kind of cultural nationalist as well as, um, political nationalist. But beyond that, we don't have that much of a sense of what makes him, what makes him tick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4726" target="_blank">01:18:46.380</a></span> | <span class="t">We get little hints. Um, you know, there was a secret speech where he talked about that leaked out that he talked about how the Soviet Union had collapsed because people didn't, the leadership didn't pay enough attention to ideology. And he also said that none of them were manly enough to keep control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4745" target="_blank">01:19:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So he, if I imagine if he and, he and Putin ever have a kind of heart to heart conversation, it's one thing they'd find to agree on is this sort of distaste for Gorbachev. This feeling that Gorbachev was, that was the wrong way to do things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4760" target="_blank">01:19:20.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Not manly enough.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4761" target="_blank">01:19:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, to not strong enough about, you know, really keeping control. And, you know, for Putin, it would be that it led to the Soviet Union, to the loss of an empire. But for Xi Jinping, it's, there is a bit of being haunted.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4774" target="_blank">01:19:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">There is a bit of being haunted by what happened to the Soviet Union. And we're not, I'm not going to be the leader who sees the diminishment of this landmass that was in a sense rebuilt over time for Mao and then Deng Xiaoping.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4793" target="_blank">01:19:53.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, you have the story, a very powerful story about the Chinese past that the Chinese Communist Party makes a lot out of. But the Chiang Kai-shek, the Nationalist Party, who was Mao's great rival, also made a lot out of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4806" target="_blank">01:20:06.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And it has a partial basis, in fact, was that from the middle of the 19th century to the middle of the 20th century, China, which had been a strong force in the world, got bullied and nibbled away at by foreign powers. And it's important to realize there are elements of that story that are very true. And the answer they had is that, under my watch, that's not going to happen. And the reason why my party deserves to rule is because it can reassert China's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4835" target="_blank">01:20:35.380</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a place in the world. And both the Nationalist Party and the Communist Party predicated themselves on this kind of nationalistic story of being in a position to prevent that from happening again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4848" target="_blank">01:20:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a bit of a tricky question, but is it safe for journalists, for folks who write excellent books about the topic to travel to China?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4862" target="_blank">01:21:02.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there are all kinds of different things about safety or not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4865" target="_blank">01:21:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, until recently at least, the people who were most vulnerable were people of Chinese descent, people originally from China who had gone abroad and coming back, or even people who were Chinese Americans who went there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4882" target="_blank">01:21:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So you had early cases. My friend Melissa Chan was an early person kicked out when she was working for Al Jazeera and reporting on Xinjiang. So that's one kind of person who was vulnerable because of this expectation that they should be somehow more loyal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4904" target="_blank">01:21:44.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Another kind of person who was vulnerable or, in this case, more likely to be blocked from China, the Communist Party is particularly concerned about people from outside of China who are amplifying the voices of people within China or exiles from China who the government would like to silence.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4926" target="_blank">01:22:06.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So the Dalai Lama, you had scholars who worked on Tibet and had connections to the Dalai Lama, where early people would have trouble going to the PRC.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4934" target="_blank">01:22:14.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Then scholars who worked on Xinjiang and were connected to Uyghurs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4940" target="_blank">01:22:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">But there also were people who were sort of personally

all that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=4975" target="_blank">01:22:55.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And I kept getting visas to

there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5012" target="_blank">01:23:32.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It was also not picking a fight

Hong Kong was a place that I'd be free to go, even if things got difficult.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5066"

target="_blank">01:24:29.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But with Hong Kong, with the mainland, I had kept a kind of distance from the dissidents that I was writing about.</span></div><div

apply and I was more connected to them, more friends with some of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5088" target="_blank">01:24:48.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And then with this crackdown that's come on Hong Kong and their exiles from Hong Kong who have bounties on their heads.</span></div><div

that anything would happen to me if I went to Hong Kong, but I feel I would be very closely watched.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5105" target="_blank">01:25:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I wouldn't want to meet with some of my friends there who aren't this high profile.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5110" target="_blank">01:25:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So I don't want to go to a place where I would feel that I was toxic in some way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5116" target="_blank">01:25:16.700</a></span> |

target="_blank">01:26:48.900</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think the consensus among us, and these were some of the most knowledgeable foreign scholars on China, was this was somebody who really had probably topped out because he was meeting with us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5FWUN5w2Q&t=5220" target="_blank">01:27:00.780</a></span>
