And now, dear friends, here's Jeannie Vermetti.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=79" target="_blank">00:01:19.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You worked at IBM for over 40 years, starting as a systems engineer, and you ran the company</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">as chairman, president, and CEO from 2011 to 2020. IBM is one of the largest tech companies in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=91" target="_blank">00:01:31.840</a></span> | <span class="t">world with, maybe you can correct me on this, with about 280,000 employees. What are the biggest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.760</a></span> | <span class="t">challenges running the company of that size? Let's start with a sort of big overview question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">The biggest challenges I think are not in running them, it's in changing them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And that idea to know what you should change and what you should not change. Actually, people don't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=114" target="_blank">00:01:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">always ask that question. What should endure, even if it has to be modernized, but what should endure?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I found the hardest part was changing how work got done at such a big company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">What was the parts that you thought should endure? The core of the company that was beautiful and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">powerful and could persist through time, that should persist through time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I'd be interested, do you have a perception of what you think it would be?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Do I have a perception? Well, I'm a romantic for a history of long running companies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.040</a></span> | <span class="t">so there's kind of a tradition as a AI person. To me, IBM has some epic sort of research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">accomplishments where you show off, you know, Deep Blue and Watson, just impressive big moonshot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">challenges and accomplishing those. But that's, I think, probably a small part of what IBM is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">That's mostly like the sexy public facing part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Well, certainly the research part itself is over 3,000, so it's not that small. That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a pretty big research group. But the part that should endure ends up being a company that does</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.040</a></span> | <span class="t">things that are essential to the world. Meaning, think back, you said you're a romantic. It was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the '30s, the social security system. It was putting the man on the moon. It was, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.680</a></span> | <span class="t">to this day, banks don't run, railroads don't run. That is at its core, it's doing mission</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">critical work. And so that part, I think, is at its core, it's a business to business company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And at its core, it's about doing things that are really important to the world becoming running and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">being better. Running the infrastructure of the world, so doing it at scale, doing it reliably.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, secure in this world, that's like everything. And in fact, when I started,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I almost felt people were looking for what that was. And together, we sort of, in a word,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it was to be essential. And the reason I love that word was I can't call myself essential.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.280</a></span> | <span class="t">You have to determine I am, right? So it was to be essential, even though some of what we did is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">exactly what you said, it's below the surface. So many people, because people say to me, well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">what does IBM do now? Right? And over the years, it's changed so much. And today, it's really a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.240</a></span> | <span class="t">software and consulting company. Consulting is a third of it. And the software is all hybrid cloud</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and AI. That would not have been true, as you well know, back even two decades ago, right? So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it changes. But I think at its core, it's that be essential. You said moonshot, can't all be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">moonshots because moonshots don't always work, but mission critical work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So given the size, though, when you started running it, did you feel the sort of thing that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">people usually associate with size, which is bureaucracy, and maybe the aspect of size that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.680</a></span> | <span class="t">hinder progress or hinder pivoting, did you feel that? - You would, for lots of reasons. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">when you're a big company, sometimes people think of process as the client themselves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I always say to people, your process is not your customer. There is a real customer here that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.760</a></span> | <span class="t">exist for. And that's really easy to fall into because people are a master to this process. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that's not right. And when you're big, the other thing, and boy, there's a premium on it, is speed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">right? That in our industry, you got to be fast. And go back, like when I took over and it was 2012,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">we had a lot of catching up to do and a lot of things to do, and it was moving so fast. And as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.800</a></span> | <span class="t">you well know, all those trends were happening at once, which made them go even faster. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">pretty unprecedented, actually, for that many trends to be at one time. And I used to say to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">people, "Go faster, go faster, go faster." And honestly, I've tired them out. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it kind of dawned on me that when you're that big, that's a really valuable lesson. And it taught me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the how's perhaps more important than the what. Because if I didn't do something to change how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.560</a></span> | <span class="t">work was done, like change those processes or give them new tools, help them with skills,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">they couldn't. They'll just do the same thing faster. If someone tells you, "You've got hiking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">boots," and they're like, "No, go run a marathon." You're like, "I can't do it in those boots."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">But so you've got to do something.

And then I watched IBM people say, "Oh,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually could learn something."

And I think there's like a few areas that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">really important that you always do. Now, it doesn't mean you're showing. So, like when it has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1069" target="_blank">00:17:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to do with values and value-based decisions, like I think it's really important to constantly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">show people that you walk your talk on that kind of thing. It's super important. And I actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">think it's a struggle young companies have because the values aren't deeply rooted. And when a storm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1088" target="_blank">00:18:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">comes, it's easy to uproot. And so, I always felt like when it was that time, I showed it. I got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1095" target="_blank">00:18:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">taught that so young at IBM and even General Motors. In fact, I do write about that in the book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">First time I was a manager, I had a gentleman telling dirty jokes. And not to me, but to other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1110" target="_blank">00:18:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">people. And it really offended people and some of the women. And this is the very early '80s.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1118" target="_blank">00:18:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And they came, said something. I talked to my boss. I'm a first-time manager. And he was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">unequivocal with what I should do. He said, and this was a top performer, "It stops immediately</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1130" target="_blank">00:18:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">or you fire him." So, there are a few areas like that that I actually think you have to always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1136" target="_blank">00:18:56.400</a></span> | <span class="t">continue to role model and show. That to me isn't the kind that like when do you let go of stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">The values and relationships with clients.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, whatever you're in service of. And the other thing was, I really felt it was really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1150" target="_blank">00:19:10.960</a></span> | <span class="t">important to role model learning. So, I can remember when we started down the journey</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1157" target="_blank">00:19:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">and we went on to this thing called the Think Academy.

When the whole</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">company has to transform, everybody's got to kind of have some skin in this game and understand it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1177" target="_blank">00:19:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I taught the first hour of every month for four years.

I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1189" target="_blank">00:19:49.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, that kind of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1190" target="_blank">00:19:50.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it was a compulsory Thursday night education for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm a little bit better prepared than that.

I'm always</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1225" target="_blank">00:20:25.680</a></span> | <span class="t">almost late. And I don't know why that is. I mean, there's some deep psychological thing we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1230" target="_blank">00:20:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">should probably investigate. But it's probably the anxiety brings out the performance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1234" target="_blank">00:20:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">That can be. That's very true with some people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1236" target="_blank">00:20:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, so, I'm a programmer and engineer at heart. And so, programmers famously overestimate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1241" target="_blank">00:20:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">or underestimate, sorry, how long something's going to take. And so, I just, everything,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1247" target="_blank">00:20:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">always underestimate. And it's almost as if I want to feel this chaos of anxiety of a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1254" target="_blank">00:20:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">deadline or something like this.

So, we have to know ourselves. But for you, you like to prepare.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.600</a></span> | <span class="t">For me. Yeah. It came from a few different places. I mean, one would have been as a kid,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1268" target="_blank">00:21:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, I was not a memorizer. And my brother is brilliant. He can read it once, boom, done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, I always wanted to understand how something happened. It didn't matter what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1281" target="_blank">00:21:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">it was I was doing. Whether it was algebra, theorems, I always wanted, don't give me the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">answer. Don't give me the answer. I want to figure it out, figure it out. So, I could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1287" target="_blank">00:21:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">reproduce it again and didn't have to memorize. So, it started with that. And then over time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1292" target="_blank">00:21:32.720</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, so I was in university in the 70s. When I was in engineering school, I was the only woman.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1299" target="_blank">00:21:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I meet people still to this day and they're like, "Oh, I remember you." I'm like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1302" target="_blank">00:21:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">"Yeah, sorry, I don't remember you. There were 30 of you, one of me." And I think you already</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1307" target="_blank">00:21:47.360</a></span> | <span class="t">get that feeling of, okay, I better really study hard because whatever I say is going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1310" target="_blank">00:21:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">remembered in this class, good or bad. And it started there. So, in some ways, I did it for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">two reasons. Early on, I think it was a shield for confidence. The more I studied, the more prepared</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1324" target="_blank">00:22:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I was, the more confident. That's probably still true to this day. The second reason I did it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1330" target="_blank">00:22:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">evolved over time and became different to prepare. If I was really prepared, then when we're in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1337" target="_blank">00:22:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">moment, I can really listen to you. See, because I don't have to be doing all this stuff on the fly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1341" target="_blank">00:22:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in my head. And I could actually take things I know and maybe help the situation. So, it really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1347" target="_blank">00:22:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">became a way that I could be present in the moment. And I think it's something a lot of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1354" target="_blank">00:22:34.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that in the moment, I learned it from my husband. He doesn't prepare by the way at all. So, that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1358" target="_blank">00:22:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">not it. But I watched the in the moment part. The negative example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1363" target="_blank">00:22:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">No, no, no. And I'm not going to change that. As he says, he's a type C, I'm an A.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1366" target="_blank">00:22:46.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, of course. That's how love works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1367" target="_blank">00:22:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And I have been married 43 years and that seems to work. But that idea that you could be in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">moment with people is a really important thing. Yeah. So, the preparation gives you the freedom</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">to really be present. So, just to linger on, you mentioned your brother. And it seems like in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1386" target="_blank">00:23:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">book that you really had to work hard when you studied to sort of, given that you weren't good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1393" target="_blank">00:23:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">at memorization, you really truly deeply wanted to understand the stuff and you put in the hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">work. And that seems to persist throughout your career. So, hard work is often associated with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1403" target="_blank">00:23:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of has negative associations. Well, maybe with burnout, with dissatisfaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1409" target="_blank">00:23:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there some aspect of hard work at the core of who you are that led to happiness for you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1416" target="_blank">00:23:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Did you enjoy it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I enjoyed it. So, I'll be the first. And I'm really careful to say that to people because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1423" target="_blank">00:23:43.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think everyone should associate, "Gee, to do what you did, there's only one route there."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1428" target="_blank">00:23:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? And that's just not true. And I do it because I like it. In fact, I'm careful. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">as time goes on, you have to be careful as more and more people watch you. Whether you like it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1437" target="_blank">00:23:57.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you're a role model or not. You are a role model for people. Whether you know it, like it, want it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1441" target="_blank">00:24:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">does not matter. I learned that the hard way. And I would have to say to people, "Hey, just because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1445" target="_blank">00:24:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I do this does not mean I do it for these reasons." Right? So, be really explicit. And I'd come to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1451" target="_blank">00:24:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">believe, usually when people say the word power, I don't know, do you have a positive or negative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1454" target="_blank">00:24:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">notion when I say the word power? We'll just do a- - Probably negative one, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1458" target="_blank">00:24:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">- For some stereotype or some view that somebody's abused it in some way. You can read the newspaper,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1463" target="_blank">00:24:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">somebody's doing something. Personal people, like I'll ask people, "Do you want power?" And they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1469" target="_blank">00:24:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">like, "Oh no, I'd rather do good." And I think the irony is you need power to do good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1475" target="_blank">00:24:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, that sort of led me down to, as I thought about my own life, right? Because it starts in a,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1482" target="_blank">00:24:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like many of us, you don't have a lot, but you don't know that because you're like everybody</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1488" target="_blank">00:24:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">else around you at that time. And on one end, tragedy, right? My father leaves my mother,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1494" target="_blank">00:24:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">homeless, no money, no food, nothing, four kids.

And the irony that I hear I would end up as the ninth CEO of one of America's iconic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1506" target="_blank">00:25:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">companies. And now I co-chair this group 110. And that journey, I said, "The biggest thing I learned</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1511" target="_blank">00:25:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">was you could do really hard, meaningful things in a positive way." So now you ask me about why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">do I work so hard? I ended up writing the book in three pieces for this reason. When you really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1522" target="_blank">00:25:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">think of your life and power, I thought it kind of fell like a pebble in water. Like there's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">ring about you really care about yourself and like the power of yourself, power of me. There's a time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1535" target="_blank">00:25:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">it transcends to that you are working with and for others and another moment when it becomes like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1539" target="_blank">00:25:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">about society.

And that hard work part, my great-grandma, as you and I were comparing notes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1565" target="_blank">00:26:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">on Russia, right? And never spoke English, spoke Russian, came here to this country, was a cleaning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1571" target="_blank">00:26:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">person at the Wrigley Building in Chicago. Yet if she hadn't saved every dime she made,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1577" target="_blank">00:26:17.120</a></span> | <span class="t">my mother wouldn't have a home and wouldn't have had a car, right? What did I learn from that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1582" target="_blank">00:26:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hard work. In fact, actually, when I went to college, she's like, "You know, you really should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1585" target="_blank">00:26:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">be on a farm. You're so big and strong." That was her view. And then my grandmother,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1591" target="_blank">00:26:31.520</a></span> | <span class="t">another tragic life. What did she do though? And think how long, that's in the 40s, the 50s,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1597" target="_blank">00:26:37.680</a></span> | <span class="t">she made lampshades. And she taught me how to sew, right? So I could sew clothes when we couldn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=1603" target="_blank">00:26:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">afford them.

So I was a young kid. And I met him when I had a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2072" target="_blank">00:34:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">General Motors scholarship.

And a professor said, "Hey, you should sign up for this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2083" target="_blank">00:34:43.440</a></span> | <span class="t">interview.

I am eternally thankful for that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2101" target="_blank">00:35:01.680</a></span> | <span class="t">advice.

So part of that was in the summer,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2111" target="_blank">00:35:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I had to work in Detroit.

I'm going to fix you up with someone tonight." And that turned out to be my husband.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2128" target="_blank">00:35:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it was a blind date is how we very first met.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2131" target="_blank">00:35:31.680</a></span> | <span class="t">- And then it was over.

Your book is called "Good Power, Leading Positive Change in Our Lives,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2146" target="_blank">00:35:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Work, and World."

I would also tell you, I hope one day I'm remembered for how I did things, not just for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2165" target="_blank">00:36:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">what I did.

So the essence to me of good power, if I had a contrast, good to bad, let's say, would be that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2175" target="_blank">00:36:15.360</a></span> | <span class="t">first off, you have to embrace and navigate tension. This is the world we live in. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2182" target="_blank">00:36:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">by embracing tension, not running from it, you would bridge divides that unites people,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2188" target="_blank">00:36:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">not divides them. It's a hard thing to do, but you can do it. You do it with respect,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2193" target="_blank">00:36:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">which is the opposite of fear. A lot of people think the way to get things done is fear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2197" target="_blank">00:36:37.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the third thing would be, you got to celebrate some progress versus perfection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2204" target="_blank">00:36:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I also think that's what stops a lot of things from happening. Because if you go for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2208" target="_blank">00:36:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever your definition of perfect is, it's either polarization or paralyzation. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2214" target="_blank">00:36:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">something happens in there versus no, no, no.

It was a really hard thing for me to do because I don't actually talk about all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2237" target="_blank">00:37:17.360</a></span> | <span class="t">these things. And I had to, nobody cares about your like scientific description of this. They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2242" target="_blank">00:37:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">want the stories in your life to bring it alive. So it's a memoir with purpose. And in the writing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2247" target="_blank">00:37:27.200</a></span> | <span class="t">of it, it became the power of me, the power of we, and the power of us. The idea that you build a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2253" target="_blank">00:37:33.120</a></span> | <span class="t">foundation when you're young, mostly from my work life, the power of we, which says, I kind of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2260" target="_blank">00:37:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in retrospect, could see five principles on how to really drive change that would be done in a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2267" target="_blank">00:37:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">good way. And then eventually you could scale that, the power really of us, which is what I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2272" target="_blank">00:37:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">doing about finding better jobs for more people now that I co-chair an organization called 110.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2278" target="_blank">00:37:58.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So that essence of navigate tensions, do it respectfully, celebrate progress,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2286" target="_blank">00:38:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and indulge me one more minute, these sort of, again, it's retrospect that I didn't know this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2294" target="_blank">00:38:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in the moment. I had to learn it. I learned it. I am blessed by a lot of people I worked with and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2298" target="_blank">00:38:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">around. But some of the principles, like the first one says, if you're going to do something,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2307" target="_blank">00:38:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">change something, do something, you got to be in service of something. Being in service of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2314" target="_blank">00:38:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">is really different than serving, super different. And like, I just had my knee replaced</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2319" target="_blank">00:38:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and I interviewed all these doctors. You can tell the difference that the guy who's going to do a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2324" target="_blank">00:38:44.800</a></span> | <span class="t">surgery, hey, my surgery is fine.

Your hardware is good. I actually had some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2332" target="_blank">00:38:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">trouble.

Okay. There's a big difference in those two things. And it's true in any business</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2347" target="_blank">00:39:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you have.

Or did he care</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2353" target="_blank">00:39:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">he had a good time? So that thought to be in service of, it took me a while to get that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2358" target="_blank">00:39:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like to try to write it, to get that across.

So anyways, I just felt that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2403" target="_blank">00:40:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like good tech, everybody's a tech company.

I believe one of the tenants of good tech is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2418" target="_blank">00:40:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like responsibility for the longterm.

Like we did quantum computing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=2427" target="_blank">00:40:27.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Great.

So I think of it as how to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=3892" target="_blank">01:04:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">improve business and apply technology and see it all the way through.

Yes. So let me say, it's almost like a personal question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=3901" target="_blank">01:05:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was a big thing you were a part of that you led in 2002, that you championed and helped,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=3908" target="_blank">01:05:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I should say, negotiate the purchase of Monday, the consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=3914" target="_blank">01:05:14.640</a></span> | <span class="t">for $3.5 billion. So what were some of the challenges of that that you remember,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=3919" target="_blank">01:05:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">personal and business? - At that time, PW had to, really had to divest.

So we sort of swept in at that point and said, and we'd been thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=3933" target="_blank">01:05:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">about it a long time and started to work on that as an acquisition. So, kind of balancing which way</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=3939" target="_blank">01:05:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">would they go, IPO or acquisition. And so the challenges are obvious and part of it's why they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=3944" target="_blank">01:05:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">went with us as an acquisition.

You have the challenge of when you acquire</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=3965" target="_blank">01:06:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">something like that, as I say, you acquire hearts, not parts.

And then we had to really build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=3980" target="_blank">01:06:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a new business model that people and clients would see as valuable and be willing to pay for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=3986" target="_blank">01:06:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And so we had to do something that lived at that intersection and say that how this was unique is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=3991" target="_blank">01:06:31.760</a></span> | <span class="t">what we were doing.

So, and the others had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=4004" target="_blank">01:06:44.160</a></span> | <span class="t">all failed that had tried to do this.

Well,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiCxj-bXu5M&t=4170" target="_blank">01:09:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">that had an impact on margins really fast.
