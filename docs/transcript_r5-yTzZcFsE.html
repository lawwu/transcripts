You want a house to be as airtight and well insulated as you can. If you don't have a well airtight house, it doesn't matter what kind of tech you put into it, what kind of solar panels you put on it, if it can't hold onto its heat energy or keep heat out efficiently, your energy use is gonna go through the roof.</p><p>So you have to make sure that you're building it right to make sure that it meets certain standards. And one of those is a passive house. There's a passive house standard that is very popular around the world. It's gaining ground. I did not build my house to passive house certification, but I took a lot of the underlying principles into mind when putting this house together.</p><p>And I worked with a company that was able to meet close to passive house level, airtightness, insulation values, to make sure that every watt of energy I spend to heat this house stays in the house as long as it can.</p></div></div></body></html>
