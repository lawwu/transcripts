The new kid on the street, the U.S. Bank Smartly Visa Signature Card, because it earns up to 4% cashback on every single purchase. It's stated as a unlimited 2% cashback card, because in order to get to 4%, you need to have some money stored at U.S.</p><p>Bank. Now that money doesn't have to be in a checking account. It could also be in a brokerage account. And so you could transfer over an IRA or some stocks. And if you transfer 5,000 or more dollars over, or you hold $5,000 or more in your accounts, you get 2.5% on everything.</p><p>If you go over 50,000, you get 3% back on your card. And if you go over $100,000, you get 4% back on everything. Now, that is incredible. I don't honestly even understand how this is possible, because as someone who now runs an e-commerce website, I'm not paying 4% to run credit card transactions.</p><p>So how they can afford to give you 4%, I have no idea. How long this will last, I don't know. But I have multiple friends with this card and they have gotten their 4% back and they've been very happy with their experience with U.S. Bank.</p></div></div></body></html>
