So my agent said C, the inside items. - Yeah. - Personal belongings, he described it as this, which I thought was a great, just a perfect analogy for it. If I were to take your home, and I'd pick it up off the ground, and I were to shake it, anything that falls out would be considered those personal belongings.</p><p>Now, I had installed speakers in my ceilings and all that stuff, and he's, those are hard attached. Those are attached to your home. You couldn't remove them without causing damage to the home. So we have to include that in the main dwelling. And if you hit your cap there, then they're not covering the speakers.</p><p>So I hit my cap on the dwelling. So they're like, oh, you're out the cost of speakers. The electronics are related to that stuff that it was hard mounted. It's actually to your benefit to get like sound bars and stuff that isn't- - Now if it's mounted to the wall.</p><p>- Then you'll be okay with that if it's mounted to the wall. But just remember, if you're going and doing that dream 7.1 surround sound system where it's all put into the wall and all that, they are not gonna include that. As a personal belonging, it's part of your dwelling.</p></div></div></body></html>
