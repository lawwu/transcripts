And I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, Dave, maybe you could talk a little bit about the scale of the problem. I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you've highlighted a lot of this in your investor presentations.

So, you know, I think as we think about the problem, of course excess calories</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=315" target="_blank">00:05:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">versus expenditure is a key part, but so is probably the ultra processed food story, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=322" target="_blank">00:05:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you didn't have data on there, but it is, you know, I think in the US we're now eating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">two thirds of our calories in our country are ultra processed.

And that compares</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to like 35% in Europe.

And in this environment today, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2456" target="_blank">00:40:56.760</a></span> | <span class="t">may be more challenging to deal with than it ever has been certain senators that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2463" target="_blank">00:41:03.080</a></span> | <span class="t">shall not name would look at this and say, hey, you're making an 81% gross margin selling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2467" target="_blank">00:41:07.640</a></span> | <span class="t">these products to sick people. How can you justify that? So maybe talk a little bit about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2472" target="_blank">00:41:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">how you deal with the political environment in the US around the world, as you are successful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2479" target="_blank">00:41:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and are projected to triple the business over the next couple of years here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2482" target="_blank">00:41:22.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, well, it's obviously a top of list issue for me every day. Maybe a couple things there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2487" target="_blank">00:41:27.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Dave. So I mean, first of all, this is a very long investment cycle business. As we talked</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2493" target="_blank">00:41:33.200</a></span> | <span class="t">about earlier, like we launched the first GLP-1 drug in the world in 2005. And since</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2497" target="_blank">00:41:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that time, we've been working for, you know, this kind of performance, because we took</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2502" target="_blank">00:41:42.240</a></span> | <span class="t">risk against that idea, right, and refined it and work that problem. And that, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2508" target="_blank">00:41:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that timescale is hard for people to think about. But also, you know, the dollar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2512" target="_blank">00:41:52.080</a></span> | <span class="t">scale of the R&D, this year, we'll spend over $11 billion on R&D, which is a meaningful,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2519" target="_blank">00:41:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like a nation state scale, like it's more than the country of Germany. So we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2525" target="_blank">00:42:05.160</a></span> | <span class="t">pushing forward new medicines, based on the revenue of today's medicines. And that virtuous</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2530" target="_blank">00:42:10.760</a></span> | <span class="t">cycle is sometimes just hard to articulate. But when you get it right, you can have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2534" target="_blank">00:42:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">big societal impact. So that's the first thing. Secondly, you know, I think the pressure is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2538" target="_blank">00:42:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">a privilege in a way, it means we made something useful enough that a lot of people need it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2543" target="_blank">00:42:23.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and want it. And now our job is to work with, you know, the healthcare system to sustainably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2548" target="_blank">00:42:28.280</a></span> | <span class="t">adopt it. And we do see that as our responsibility to work with, you know, politicians, if that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2554" target="_blank">00:42:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">who we work with, or health plans or employers to find a way to get this medicine, which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2560" target="_blank">00:42:40.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we think is amazing, there's appetite to so many people, and do it in a way that's sustainable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2566" target="_blank">00:42:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, hopefully, we've created enough value that certainly the people who are getting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2571" target="_blank">00:42:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the drug are benefiting, that the health plans are actually lowering costs in the long term,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2575" target="_blank">00:42:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">even though there may be an increase in the short term, and that we make a reasonable</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2579" target="_blank">00:42:59.400</a></span> | <span class="t">profit for our shareholders, and sustain R&D for the future. So I think that's what's happening</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2584" target="_blank">00:43:04.840</a></span> | <span class="t">here. I think this week, actually, Novo Nordisk, our competitor, was called before Congress</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2589" target="_blank">00:43:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">to talk about this issue. There's a lot of other dysfunctions in the US system that we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2594" target="_blank">00:43:14.840</a></span> | <span class="t">could talk about in terms of how inefficient healthcare is. I mean, here's a medicine that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2599" target="_blank">00:43:19.320</a></span> | <span class="t">could augment 100, 200 adult diseases in a meaningful way. It's expensive, yes, probably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2606" target="_blank">00:43:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">net pricing for us, you know, is going to be something like $3,000, $4,000 a year in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2612" target="_blank">00:43:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">the steady state per person. But I think we'll create more value than that. We'll save the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2617" target="_blank">00:43:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">system more money than that per year per user. That's what we should be aiming for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2621" target="_blank">00:43:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">I think what's interesting about it is the biologic products, the molecules are advancing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2629" target="_blank">00:43:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and they're advancing in a pretty kind of steady way. The issue, I think, with insulin,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2636" target="_blank">00:43:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">and there's obviously been a lot of legislation and regulatory and political scrutiny around</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2642" target="_blank">00:44:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">insulin pricing, is it's the same molecule, and the price has just gone up, right? This</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2648" target="_blank">00:44:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">is the old kind of pharmaceutical companies are bad story is they've got a product that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2653" target="_blank">00:44:13.560</a></span> | <span class="t">they make for 10 cents, and then they sell it for 10 bucks, then someone says, let's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2656" target="_blank">00:44:16.680</a></span> | <span class="t">charge 100. They're like, okay, let's charge 100. And so it's classified as price gouging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2662" target="_blank">00:44:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In this particular market, you guys are certainly making a healthy market, but the products</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2665" target="_blank">00:44:25.440</a></span> | <span class="t">are also advancing. There's new combination therapies coming out and the oral therapy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2670" target="_blank">00:44:30.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's a lot of investment in improving the overall landscape of what's possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2674" target="_blank">00:44:34.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, let me address that because I took over in early 17, as you mentioned, and like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2680" target="_blank">00:44:40.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the insulin pricing scandal, which Novo and Lilly were also center of, right, was hot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2686" target="_blank">00:44:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and heavy. And so I took a lot of personal lessons from that. But, you know, every day</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2692" target="_blank">00:44:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">since that we had reduced the price of insulin, even though, you know, we have this weird</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2697" target="_blank">00:44:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">system in the U S where a lot of our two thirds of actually our gross price goes to PBMs and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2704" target="_blank">00:45:04.520</a></span> | <span class="t">insurance companies. So of the gross price that's often quoted, the net for us is about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2709" target="_blank">00:45:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">a third of that. And insulin, it was even more, where does that money go? Well, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2714" target="_blank">00:45:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">used often to cross subsidize other things in healthcare. So we have to unwind that system</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2719" target="_blank">00:45:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">if we really want to value innovation. And then the other thing, which is in this chart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2723" target="_blank">00:45:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is, and I mentioned is some of that revenue from insulin we use to invest in the next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2727" target="_blank">00:45:27.960</a></span> | <span class="t">generation of therapy, whether it be insulins, which we're still investing in new insulins</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2732" target="_blank">00:45:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">or GLP one drugs, which of course we did. And that is hard to articulate in the moment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2737" target="_blank">00:45:37.720</a></span> | <span class="t">but it actually produces good economic and social value later. Here though, we, we took</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2743" target="_blank">00:45:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">those lessons. We launched at a 20% discount to Novo's product, even though we have better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2747" target="_blank">00:45:47.240</a></span> | <span class="t">efficacy data and we've only cut the price since then.

So efficacy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2758" target="_blank">00:45:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and quality, but also mass production. And that requires a pricing strategy consistent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2763" target="_blank">00:46:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">with that. Well, you've also invested a lot in manufacturing in the United States, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2767" target="_blank">00:46:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Didn't you just do like a $5 billion investment in Indiana to build new facilities?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2771" target="_blank">00:46:11.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, we're building the largest API site in the history of the United States in Indiana.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=2776" target="_blank">00:46:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

So we have to pay a lot of attention to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=3678" target="_blank">01:01:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's what I noticed so far is there's a lot of money. I think last year, 5 billion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=3681" target="_blank">01:01:21.960</a></span> | <span class="t">with a B went into new venture backed tech bios, you know, that's what they like to call</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=3687" target="_blank">01:01:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">themselves.

Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=023exhA9irY&t=3697" target="_blank">01:01:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right.
