What does this model fundamentally want? - We can be in a position where we can look at the broad features of the model and say like, is this a model whose internal state and plans is devoted to doing what looked like fairly destructive and manipulative things?</p><p>I give an analogy to humans. It's actually possible to look at an MRI of someone and predict above random chance whether they're a psychopath. There was actually a story a few years back about a neuroscientist who was studying this and then looked at his own scan and discovered that he was a psychopath.</p><p>Is this something we can afford to be empirical about? Or do we need like some deep root math proof that this is aligned? I've actually always been a fan of studying these circuits at the lowest level of detail that we possibly can. That's how you build up knowledge by trying to make a lot of these very specific discoveries.</p><p>Like you have to understand the building blocks and then you have to figure out how to use that to draw these broad conclusions even if you're not going to figure out everything.</p></div></div></body></html>
