class="t">I had been wanting to come to the AI engineering summit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=29" target="_blank">00:00:29.900</a></span> | <span class="t">for a long time, but SWIX never invited me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Until very recently, I shared a section of agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.600</a></span> | <span class="t">from my book, AI engineering.</span></div><div class="c"><span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.500</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like 8,000 words, and people seem to like it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=42" target="_blank">00:00:42.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So SWIX invited me here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=43" target="_blank">00:00:43.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And I actually prepared another talk for the summit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=50" target="_blank">00:00:50.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But then after watching a lot of talks yesterday,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=53" target="_blank">00:00:53.720</a></span> | <span class="t">I realized that people have covered a lot of ground.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So I created a new talk hoping to cover newer, more exciting topics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=62" target="_blank">00:01:02.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a new talk created especially for this conference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And I hope you like it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I heard that if you are to give an agent talk today,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.080</a></span> | <span class="t">you're obligated to define what an agent is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=75" target="_blank">00:01:15.820</a></span> | <span class="t">I know that a lot of people think there's a lot of talk about agents is just hype.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But I don't think so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there's a lot of exciting use cases for agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I guess I'm preaching to the choir.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So "Asian" is not a new term.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">When I was working on my book, I decided to look at a lot of AI books from the 80s and the 90s,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=97" target="_blank">00:01:37.880</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to understand how people define agents back then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And a definition that's really resonate with me is from the book by Stuart Russell and Peter Novick.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=108" target="_blank">00:01:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So they define an agent as anything that can perceive the environment and then acts on the environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's say that you have an agent that plays chess.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.360</a></span> | <span class="t">That the chessboard is its environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And its actions are the chess moves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.860</a></span> | <span class="t">ChatGPT.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.860</a></span> | <span class="t">ChatGPT can interact with the internet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So the internet is its environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=131" target="_blank">00:02:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And it can do actions like web browsing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.700</a></span> | <span class="t">It can also use calculator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=135" target="_blank">00:02:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It can also like generate text and images.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So one of the most popular use cases of agents nowadays is like coding agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And here is from the paper, like SuiAgent paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=147" target="_blank">00:02:27.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And as you can see here, the environment for SuiAgent is a computer with terminal and file system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=154" target="_blank">00:02:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the list of actions it can perform includes navigate repo, search files, view files, edit lines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So the environment determines the kind of actions that the model can perform.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're in a game, if an agent is in the game, it can only perform the actions that the game allows.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.020</a></span> | <span class="t">At the same time, giving the model more actions can also help expand its environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you give the model the ability to browse the web, then now the internet becomes its environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.360</a></span> | <span class="t">There are many reasons why we would want to give a model access to actions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So first actions can help address a model limitations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So all the models have the cut off date, and that makes it pretty hard to answer questions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.900</a></span> | <span class="t">that require new information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.940</a></span> | <span class="t">By giving the models access to newer APIs such as news or weather web browsers, the model now</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.780</a></span> | <span class="t">can get relevant recent information to answer questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.820</a></span> | <span class="t">A very common limitation that people discover very early on with AI is that AI is pretty bad with math.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So instead of trying to train a model to be really, really good with numbers, it can simply give the model access to a calculator.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Another thing is a very exciting use case that you can turn text-only or image-only models into a multi-model model by giving it access to tools or actions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So first of all, given a language model, right, a language model can only process text and output text.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you want a model to also be able to process image, I can give you access to, say, an image captioning model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=254" target="_blank">00:04:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">So given an image, it can use this tool to generate captions and then use a caption to generate a response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Now that model can process both text and image.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.380</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.300</a></span> | <span class="t">But sometimes it's even more cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's why agents are so exciting is that actions allow you to embed models into the workflow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So now, for example, you can give the model access to your inbox, your Slack, your calendars, or the code editors,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">so that you can use the model in the data workflow instead of having to open, say, a web browser so that you can use AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=290" target="_blank">00:04:50.520</a></span> | <span class="t">So when we're talking about agents, people will always ask me, like, OK, if agents are so cool, so why isn't everyone using it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, tell me, like, everyone asking me, like, what would be, like, give me one good use cases of, like, agents?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=307" target="_blank">00:05:07.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So why isn't everyone using it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It's because, like, doing agents is, like, really, really hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So for the rest of the talk, I will cover, like, a few reasons why, like, doing agents is so hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So when I start with the cursor complexity, so we know that, like, task failure rate increases as the task complexity increases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">This is true not just for AI, but also for humans as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, if you're given more complex tasks, we will be more likely to fail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's say that you're building an application for your company and you're OK with a failure rate of, like, say, 1% or 2%, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And the model makes mistakes, like, 2% of the time for one step.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So over 10 steps, the model could make mistakes about, like, 18% of the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.120</a></span> | <span class="t">That might be unacceptable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=358" target="_blank">00:05:58.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And, like, if you increase your number of steps to, like, 100 steps, the model becomes, like, almost, like, worthless.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you could make mistakes most of the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=367" target="_blank">00:06:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For a lot of agent use cases, a lot of agent use cases are pretty complex and might require multiple steps to solve them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's not that you don't want to use agents for, like, simple tasks, but, like, simple tasks just don't usually need agents to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=388" target="_blank">00:06:28.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And also simple tasks might have, like, lower economic value so, like, they are less exciting for people to solve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And let's go through, like, a very, very simple example.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, let's say that you want to ask the agent to, like, how many people bought products from, like, company X in last week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=407" target="_blank">00:06:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a very, very simple query, but the agent might need to break it down in, like, in several steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=413" target="_blank">00:06:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it might first get the product list of the company X, and then for each product in this list, it will want you to get the number of, like, order from, like, last week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And then given all this number of order counts, it would have to sum it up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=427" target="_blank">00:07:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And then given this number, it had to generate a response to the users.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So even with this very, very simple query, very simple task, there were, like, four steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=436" target="_blank">00:07:16.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And the more steps there are, like, the more complex queries, even the higher number of steps, and the more likely the agent is going to fail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=445" target="_blank">00:07:25.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So in the vast majority of agent use cases I'm seeing right now, it's very, very rare to see them, like, consistently being to solve tasks that involve, like, more than five steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=459" target="_blank">00:07:39.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I do believe that enabling agents to handle more complexity will unlock many, many new use cases.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=465" target="_blank">00:07:45.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is a tricky question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=468" target="_blank">00:07:48.460</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you know what complexity your agent can solve?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you want to give agent the task that, like, at the right level of complexity, it can solve so that it doesn't fail and, like, cause, like, catastrophic business failure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So different kind of tasks, different use cases have different definitions of complexity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.340</a></span> | <span class="t">A very, very common way to define complexity is by the number of steps needed to solve the task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=497" target="_blank">00:08:17.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is, like, a synthetic planning benchmark that I'm working on and I'm hoping to, like, publish very soon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So I use synthetic data set, synthetic benchmark because it allows me to, like, control the level of complexity to study a model behavior.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So now I can ask the model, like, generate, like, tasks that require, like, five steps to solve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So with that, so in my benchmark, most models don't perform quite well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, most models can only solve tasks, like, that have, at most, like, five, that require, at most, five steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=537" target="_blank">00:08:57.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And after 10 steps, most models fail.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=541" target="_blank">00:09:01.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is, like, consistent with another study that I have seen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.940</a></span> | <span class="t">It's an older study now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=546" target="_blank">00:09:06.060</a></span> | <span class="t">It was from 2021.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's in coding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So the results, so the actual pass rates for the tasks for models must have increased a lot by now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">However, the learning, the insight, is still, like, I think, still very relevant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So in this paper, they try to construct, like, different doctrines.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they ask the model, the agent, the model to generate code based on the doctrine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=577" target="_blank">00:09:37.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So they count the complexity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">They consider, they measure complexity of the task based on, like, how many steps needed in the doctrine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=586" target="_blank">00:09:46.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, like, for this task, like, first you want to, you ask the model to write code to convert the string into lowercase.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=593" target="_blank">00:09:53.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you ask the model to write code to remove half of the characters in the string.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, this are considered, like, two building blocks or, like, two steps in the doctrine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And they found out the same result, like, as I did, is that the success rate, the pass rate, like, decreased rapidly as the number of steps increased.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=616" target="_blank">00:10:16.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But the good news is that, like, with newer models, they are actually getting a lot better with blending.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=623" target="_blank">00:10:23.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So here, in the same result, you can see this, like, here are these three very nice curves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=630" target="_blank">00:10:30.300</a></span> | <span class="t">They come from a DeepSec R1, Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, and R1 Preview.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't test this on, like, R1 and R3 because I didn't have access to this model when I ran this test.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see this, like, the curves are being pushed upward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, the models, the newer models are able to solve, like, tasks with more complexity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=649" target="_blank">00:10:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And I do believe that this is going to increase over time, allowing us to, like, using agents for more practical, complex, real-world tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's another result from my benchmark.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=661" target="_blank">00:11:01.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So as you can see here, it shows the number of tasks that each model was able to solve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=666" target="_blank">00:11:06.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And in overall, you can see that, like, there's a pretty big difference</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.020</a></span> | <span class="t">between, like, newer reasoning models, such as R1 Preview, D6 R1, and Gemini,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Flash Thinking, and non-reasoning models, just, like, Sonnet 3.5, Gemini 2.0 Pro, or, like, GPT-4-0.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=687" target="_blank">00:11:27.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Different use cases might define the complexity differently.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So here is a paper from ZebraLogic that just came out, like, just last month, in which it's a logic task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So they define each problem complexity by its number of, like, Z3 conflicts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=705" target="_blank">00:11:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see this, like, by the-- they also got the same result.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, the model success rates, like, decreased rapidly as the number of Z3 conflicts increased.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=716" target="_blank">00:11:56.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think there's several tips to get the agent to handle more complexity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.740</a></span> | <span class="t">First, we might want to break tasks into subtasks that agent can solve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So you don't want to give an agent a task more than it can handle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's say that a task-- or your task, like, consistently requires something like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.820</a></span> | <span class="t">five or six steps to solve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And so agent can-- maybe, like, sooner-- can do at most, like, three steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Then you might want to break the task into, like, two subtasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Another way to, like, help the model deal with more complexity is do, like, test-time-compute scaling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So I-- test-time-compute-- but I think that in the last few years, people have been talking a lot about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.300</a></span> | <span class="t">test-time-compute scaling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=759" target="_blank">00:12:39.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's one of the very-- one of the newer, very exciting concepts that give rise to, like, reasoning models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=765" target="_blank">00:12:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm very excited about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So the idea is that, like, you can have-- you can give the model more compute during inference.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So-- so that-- so that it can either generate, like, using more-- more thinking tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So it can think more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Or it can also-- you can-- it can also use the compute budget to generate more-- more output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, given a math problem, you can maybe, like, output 10 different samples,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.220</a></span> | <span class="t">10 different solutions, and then pick the ones that, like, the model-- like, most of this--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll pick the ones that's most common.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, most-- um, that's one of the model things output most of the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=805" target="_blank">00:13:25.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's tensile-compute scaling.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=808" target="_blank">00:13:28.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You can also use stronger models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, using stronger models can also call, like, uh, train time-- train time-compute scaling,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=816" target="_blank">00:13:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">because now you need to invest more compute into, like, training bigger models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=820" target="_blank">00:13:40.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So we finished the first challenge, which is, like, the Curse of Complexity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">The next part, we're talking about the challenge is to tune use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, tune use is basically, like, natural language, uh, through API translations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And what does this mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=836" target="_blank">00:13:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, a lot of time for agents, right, we have humans using agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And the human gives the agent instructions in natural language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, an agent-- a human might give the agent a task like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.060</a></span> | <span class="t">"Hey, given this customer email, create an order."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the agent, um, will need to translate that into, like, uh, functions that can perform this task.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it might first need to call a function to extract the customer ID from the email address.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=863" target="_blank">00:14:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And then it might call another function to extract the order ID from the content of the email.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=868" target="_blank">00:14:28.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And then given this customer ID and the order, you would need to actually create the order.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So, now you can see that it can-- it needs to translate from this natural language to just a set of API calls.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=879" target="_blank">00:14:39.340</a></span> | <span class="t">The challenge with this is that the challenge comes from both sides of the-- of the translations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=885" target="_blank">00:14:45.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for natural language, it can be, like, extremely ambiguous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=889" target="_blank">00:14:49.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And at the same time, on API side, you can have very bad API and very bad documentations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=895" target="_blank">00:14:55.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's go and show the first example of, like, ambiguous natural language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Consider these agents with access to very, very simple functions, like fetch top products and fetch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.740</a></span> | <span class="t">product info.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that fetch product info can return you, like, the product price.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's say, like, I see that the fetch top products take in, like, three arguments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, start date, end date, and number products, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So, now the agent knows that it needs to call the fetch top products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But what would the start date be?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=929" target="_blank">00:15:29.980</a></span> | <span class="t">What would the number product be?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, how many products should it query?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=933" target="_blank">00:15:33.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And what start date, what end date should it be?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=935" target="_blank">00:15:35.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, would it be, like, from, like, does the user want best-selling products from, like, yesterday,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.020</a></span> | <span class="t">from last week, or from last month?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this is very ambiguous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=944" target="_blank">00:15:44.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=946" target="_blank">00:15:46.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, now we talk about, like, very, very bad API or bad documentations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.940</a></span> | <span class="t">In my coding career, I have been, like, pretty, like, fortunate or unfortunate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=956" target="_blank">00:15:56.060</a></span> | <span class="t">You have seen, like, really, really, really bad comments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=959" target="_blank">00:15:59.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So, as an engineer myself, I know that, like, people don't usually like writing documentations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=966" target="_blank">00:16:06.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you can't explain the function to the agent, it's going to be really, really hard</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.900</a></span> | <span class="t">for the agent to know how to use this right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I do think that's, like, when you give an agent, like, access to a tool,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.700</a></span> | <span class="t">you will need to provide necessary documentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=987" target="_blank">00:16:27.020</a></span> | <span class="t">As a list, you need to explain, like, what the function does,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=989" target="_blank">00:16:29.820</a></span> | <span class="t">what parameters does it take in, like, what is the type of the parameter,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=993" target="_blank">00:16:33.740</a></span> | <span class="t">what does the parameter stand for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.660</a></span> | <span class="t">You also need to show, like, different error codes for the functions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1000" target="_blank">00:16:40.620</a></span> | <span class="t">and also, like, expected, like, returned values.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1003" target="_blank">00:16:43.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And the more details, the better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1005" target="_blank">00:16:45.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's not all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1007" target="_blank">00:16:47.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Because, like, with error code, right, you don't just want, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1010" target="_blank">00:16:50.060</a></span> | <span class="t">"Okay, this model returns this error, like, stat 99."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1013" target="_blank">00:16:53.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it doesn't mean much for the model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1015" target="_blank">00:16:55.820</a></span> | <span class="t">You might want to, like, explain to the agent, like, "Okay, this error is usually caused by this."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1020" target="_blank">00:17:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you enter this error, if you encounter this error, maybe that is how you should address this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And one company told me that, like, one of the biggest improvements they got for their agents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1033" target="_blank">00:17:13.740</a></span> | <span class="t">is after they explained and add to the documentation, like, how to interpret return values of the functions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.900</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's say that the function, like, returns the value of, like, one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1044" target="_blank">00:17:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, what does that mean?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1045" target="_blank">00:17:25.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you help the model interpret the result, the model, the agent can actually be able to perform, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1053" target="_blank">00:17:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">call the functions, like, a lot better and then be able to plan a lot better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1056" target="_blank">00:17:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Another very important thing to think about is that, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.300</a></span> | <span class="t">tool use for agents can be, like, counter-intuitive for us because humans and AIs, like, have fundamentally</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.540</a></span> | <span class="t">different ways of, like, using tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1072" target="_blank">00:17:52.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, like, humans and AI have different, like, preferences.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So humans might prefer working with, like, visual things, like with GUIs, whereas, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">AI might work better with, like, APIs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1083" target="_blank">00:18:03.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, if you ask a human to use Salesforce, they might go to Salesforce website.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1087" target="_blank">00:18:07.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you, like, assign tasks for AI, it will, like, it would perform much better, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">not having to deal with a lot of visual cues and just, like, calling the straightforward API instead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And also, like, humans and AI operate in a different way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, humans, like, at least for me, I find impossible to perform multiple tasks at once.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1106" target="_blank">00:18:26.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So I could perform, like, different steps, like, sequentially.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1109" target="_blank">00:18:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas AI can perform tasks in, like, parallel.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, if you need agents to perform, like, to browse, if you need to, like, browse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1119" target="_blank">00:18:39.100</a></span> | <span class="t">a hundred websites, it could be, like, very, very boring for humans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1124" target="_blank">00:18:44.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I did that for my book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, I browsed, like, thousands of websites, but it was not fun at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.420</a></span> | <span class="t">However, for AI, browsing a hundred of websites or, like, a thousand of websites is extremely easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1135" target="_blank">00:18:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">You can just send out, like, open, like, like, query, like, this thousand of websites</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and get back the summaries.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1141" target="_blank">00:19:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's pretty straightforward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So that is actually a challenge for, like, training or creating examples for the models</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1148" target="_blank">00:19:08.700</a></span> | <span class="t">to do planning or tool news.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1151" target="_blank">00:19:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Because given a task, what the human annotator does might not be optimal for AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1157" target="_blank">00:19:17.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's the reason why the reinforcement learning is so exciting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Because with supervised file tooling, like, you are teaching AI to, like, clone human behaviors,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1170" target="_blank">00:19:30.460</a></span> | <span class="t">which might not be optimal for AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1172" target="_blank">00:19:32.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas with reinforcement learning, like, you let the model figure it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1176" target="_blank">00:19:36.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, we try an error, and you might find ways to do it that is optimal for AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1181" target="_blank">00:19:41.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So there are several tips, like, how to make agents better at tool use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first is that you should create, like, very, very good documentation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, with everything, not just the function descriptions, parameters,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1195" target="_blank">00:19:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">but, like, arrow, like, return values, like, we just talked about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1197" target="_blank">00:19:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">We should actually give agents, like, very narrow and well-to-defi functions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So we just caught up with a friend working for a very big company.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1207" target="_blank">00:20:07.260</a></span> | <span class="t">I wouldn't say the name, but if you say the search engine, you probably know what it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1211" target="_blank">00:20:11.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And he was saying that, like, for their use cases, they give their agents, like, only three or four</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.220</a></span> | <span class="t">very narrow and small well-to-defi tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1220" target="_blank">00:20:20.300</a></span> | <span class="t">For their agents, like, for their tasks, like, their agents just did not work at all with, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1225" target="_blank">00:20:25.260</a></span> | <span class="t">more than five tools.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1226" target="_blank">00:20:26.220</a></span> | <span class="t">You should also, like, because of, like, the ambiguity of natural languages,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1231" target="_blank">00:20:31.420</a></span> | <span class="t">you can help the models understand the tasks or the use of queries better by using techniques</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1237" target="_blank">00:20:37.100</a></span> | <span class="t">like query rewriting or using, like, intent classifier to help, like, classify the user intent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.060</a></span> | <span class="t">You can also, like, instruct, or you should definitely instruct your agent to ask for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1248" target="_blank">00:20:48.620</a></span> | <span class="t">qualifications when it's unsure of what users want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, like, if you just ask, like, five best-selling products until, like, under $10,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1259" target="_blank">00:20:59.340</a></span> | <span class="t">you can, like, mix a random guess, like, to fetch products from yesterday or from last year,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1264" target="_blank">00:21:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">or you can also, like, ask users, like, hey, do you want top product, best-selling products from yesterday</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.060</a></span> | <span class="t">or from last week?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1271" target="_blank">00:21:11.340</a></span> | <span class="t">You can also see one pretty exciting or interesting direction I'm seeing is that, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">a lot of companies are building specialized action models for specific types of queries and APIs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when we have, like, specialized model, action models for coding, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1288" target="_blank">00:21:28.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, we have some model trained specially for, let's say, like, VS Code or, like, for coding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1293" target="_blank">00:21:33.580</a></span> | <span class="t">So, why not have, like, specialized action models for different environment as well?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1299" target="_blank">00:21:39.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So, for example, I've seen, like, Salesforce might be interested in, like, building,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.100</a></span> | <span class="t">maybe I shouldn't say, like, Salesforce, I should say general, like, different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1306" target="_blank">00:21:46.140</a></span> | <span class="t">companies with very complex, like, ecosystems might want to train action models for their environment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1312" target="_blank">00:21:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, true doubt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1315" target="_blank">00:21:55.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the cursor complexity is a true new issue with natural language and API translations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the last one is context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1322" target="_blank">00:22:02.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's really funny because we have been talking about context for a long time, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1326" target="_blank">00:22:06.140</a></span> | <span class="t">first for RAC and now for agents, which is talk about context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1329" target="_blank">00:22:09.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So, models, like, AI has always requires a lot of information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1335" target="_blank">00:22:15.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So, before agents, like, a model has already had to look, like, system instructions, which can be pretty long if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1341" target="_blank">00:22:21.100</a></span> | <span class="t">you, like, really want the model, really want the application to perform well and secure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1347" target="_blank">00:22:27.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you might want to instruct the model to, like, what kind of queries you should respond to,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1351" target="_blank">00:22:31.900</a></span> | <span class="t">what kind of queries you should not respond to, what kind of tool you should carry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1355" target="_blank">00:22:35.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And then also, like, user instructions and, like, examples.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1357" target="_blank">00:22:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">But with agents, like, you see a lot more information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1362" target="_blank">00:22:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So, first, you might need to pass documentations about your tool to the agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1367" target="_blank">00:22:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And the more tools there are, the more documentation will be needed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1371" target="_blank">00:22:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Of course, like, after you call a tool, there can be tool outputs that the model will need to keep</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1376" target="_blank">00:22:56.700</a></span> | <span class="t">track of as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1377" target="_blank">00:22:57.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And this will grow with more, like, execution steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1381" target="_blank">00:23:01.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And after getting back, like, a tool output, right, the model may need to reason, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1385" target="_blank">00:23:05.980</a></span> | <span class="t">"Okay, now I got this reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1387" target="_blank">00:23:07.260</a></span> | <span class="t">What do I do next?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1388" target="_blank">00:23:08.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Or, like, after a model generated a plan, the agent may also want to reason, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1393" target="_blank">00:23:13.020</a></span> | <span class="t">"Hey, is this plan, like, reasonable?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1395" target="_blank">00:23:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Should I execute it?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1396" target="_blank">00:23:16.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And all these reasoning tokens, like, take a lot of, like, take a lot of input tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1403" target="_blank">00:23:23.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And this also grows with more complex tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, the information that an agent can work with, like, can grow very, very quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1410" target="_blank">00:23:30.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And I haven't even mentioned, like, other kind of, like, information,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1414" target="_blank">00:23:34.380</a></span> | <span class="t">such as, like, table schemas for tasks like text to SQL.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1418" target="_blank">00:23:38.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's say that you want to do, like, a text to SQL task, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're not just, you don't have, you have not just one table,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1424" target="_blank">00:23:44.940</a></span> | <span class="t">but, like, a thousand of tables.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1426" target="_blank">00:23:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when you translate a SQL query, you might need to figure out, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1430" target="_blank">00:23:50.780</a></span> | <span class="t">what table to apply the SQL query to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1433" target="_blank">00:23:53.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And for the model to be able to pick the right table, you might need to pass in, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.380</a></span> | <span class="t">all the table schemas.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1439" target="_blank">00:23:59.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you have, like, a thousand, like, table schemas,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1442" target="_blank">00:24:02.540</a></span> | <span class="t">there can be a lot of information for the model to process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1445" target="_blank">00:24:05.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So, one thing that, like, I have experienced, like, when I was working with agents,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1450" target="_blank">00:24:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that I would love to have more research on, is, like, how to make a model that works well</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1457" target="_blank">00:24:17.420</a></span> | <span class="t">with both planning and long contacts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Because in my experience, like, the models that are good with planning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1463" target="_blank">00:24:23.420</a></span> | <span class="t">are not necessarily the models that work with long contacts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1466" target="_blank">00:24:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason is that, like, plannings are, like, reasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1469" target="_blank">00:24:29.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Usually, like, require a lot of reasonings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1471" target="_blank">00:24:31.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, it requires a lot of, generate a lot of thinking of reasoning tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1474" target="_blank">00:24:34.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So, this kind of task are, like, output heavy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1478" target="_blank">00:24:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas for long contacts, it's, like, input heavy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1481" target="_blank">00:24:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And I have in my benchmark, my personal benchmark, I've seen this, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1485" target="_blank">00:24:45.420</a></span> | <span class="t">models that perform well on my long contacts benchmarks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1489" target="_blank">00:24:49.020</a></span> | <span class="t">don't perform as well on the planning benchmark and vice versa.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1493" target="_blank">00:24:53.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, okay, so we've talked about, like, an agent's, like, how to deal with a lot of information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1497" target="_blank">00:24:57.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And that information might not fit inside a model's, like, affections context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1502" target="_blank">00:25:02.540</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I want to highlight the word, like, affections here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1505" target="_blank">00:25:05.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Because a model might have very long contacts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1507" target="_blank">00:25:07.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But then it might not use that context, like, affectionately.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1510" target="_blank">00:25:10.940</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, a model might be able to fit in, like, a million tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1515" target="_blank">00:25:15.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But, like, if you give it anything more than, like, 30,000 tokens,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1518" target="_blank">00:25:18.780</a></span> | <span class="t">it might get really, really, really funky and, like, hallucinate all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1522" target="_blank">00:25:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So, at least in my personal experience, I have, like, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1527" target="_blank">00:25:27.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I have, like, done a lot of, like, benchmarks evaluations that you see, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.540</a></span> | <span class="t">at what point of my documentation does the models that, like, hallucinate and making up things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1539" target="_blank">00:25:39.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So, like, if you can't fit all your information into the model context, like, affection context,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1547" target="_blank">00:25:47.500</a></span> | <span class="t">you might need to realize on, like, other forms of, like, information persistence or information storage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1554" target="_blank">00:25:54.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, context, you can think of it as, like, a short-term memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1557" target="_blank">00:25:57.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you should use this for, like, it should be used to store information relevant to the task at hand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1563" target="_blank">00:26:03.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can also supplement it with, like, long-term memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1566" target="_blank">00:26:06.460</a></span> | <span class="t">For example, like, external databases or storage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1569" target="_blank">00:26:09.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's very common with use case, like, Rack, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1572" target="_blank">00:26:12.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, so, if you connect a model to your external databases, then you're connecting it to, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1577" target="_blank">00:26:17.900</a></span> | <span class="t">long-term memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1579" target="_blank">00:26:19.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you can also, like, it's a case of agents, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1583" target="_blank">00:26:23.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, you can, like, store less immediately relevant information in, like, external files.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1590" target="_blank">00:26:30.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's say that your task requires, like, 10 steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1595" target="_blank">00:26:35.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, maybe, and the output from these only 10 steps, like, doesn't, don't quite fit into the context.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1601" target="_blank">00:26:41.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you might want to store the output of the first few steps into external files</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1607" target="_blank">00:26:47.100</a></span> | <span class="t">and only retrieve the output, like, when necessary.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1609" target="_blank">00:26:49.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And, of course, like, there's also, like, short-term memory, long-term memory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1614" target="_blank">00:26:54.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And another level of, like, memory system is internal knowledge,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1619" target="_blank">00:26:59.580</a></span> | <span class="t">which is, like, the knowledge that the model already has.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1622" target="_blank">00:27:02.460</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you have some information that models, like, that is essential for, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1626" target="_blank">00:27:06.460</a></span> | <span class="t">the model to perform, like, multiple tasks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1629" target="_blank">00:27:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">you might want to include that in the trading data and fine-tune the model on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1633" target="_blank">00:27:13.260</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that the model can just use it as part of internal knowledge</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1636" target="_blank">00:27:16.460</a></span> | <span class="t">instead of, like, having to waste, like, context tokens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1639" target="_blank">00:27:19.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so, that is pretty much for today.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1642" target="_blank">00:27:22.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I think we talked about, like, what is an agent?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1646" target="_blank">00:27:26.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Different challenges to building agents, including, like, first, including</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1652" target="_blank">00:27:32.540</a></span> | <span class="t">trying to, like, get the model to handle the right, the task of right complexity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1658" target="_blank">00:27:38.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And we talked about tips, like, how to make the model handle more complexity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1662" target="_blank">00:27:42.540</a></span> | <span class="t">We talked about two new challenges, like, how to translate with natural language</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1666" target="_blank">00:27:46.460</a></span> | <span class="t">and API.</span></div><div

like, handle longer contacts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1671" target="_blank">00:27:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">with, like, a memory system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v5rlqUIc8&t=1672" target="_blank">00:27:52.620</a></span> | <span class="t">So, thank you
