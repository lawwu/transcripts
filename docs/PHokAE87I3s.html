And so they crossed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the river, the River Bug, traveled and lived in Siberia and then down to Uzbekistan, which is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">where they met and got married. And I was born in a displaced persons camp, which is a polite word</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">for a refugee camp in 1947. And we came to Israel in 1949. And the funny thing, there were so many</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">families who were identically situated that it seems like it's just a normal thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Your upbringing was in Israel when the country was being formed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Indeed. And of course, when you're a child, you know, just one environment, and that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">your particular neighborhood in your particular country. And so in the 1950s, as I was growing up,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">there was rationing, food was rationed. So you had to have a coupon in addition to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">money. And so my dad was managing grocery stores. And so we had a bit of better access to food. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">is a childhood like, like any childhood, it has its own peculiarities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">So then you ended up going to Hebrew University and getting your undergraduate degree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Indeed, yeah, my undergraduate degree, and then I continued immediately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=279" target="_blank">00:04:39.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in fact, combined it with an MBA. So that was the late 60s. And I was in the building</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that housed the economics department. And so I studied economics, statistics, and then finance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And in the building right next to me was the psychology department. And I would go there from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=302" target="_blank">00:05:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">time to time to earn pocket money by participating in experiments. And I just found out later that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Kahneman and Tversky were doing their revolutionary work right then. But I never heard their names</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=318" target="_blank">00:05:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">from my professors. I had no idea what they were doing, which tells you about how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">standard economics and standard finance in particular were at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=332" target="_blank">00:05:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Very small, and very narrow, and really kind of proud of being narrow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So then you decided to come here to the US and go to Columbia University to get your PhD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">That is right. Yeah, I had a boring job as a financial analyst. And so I took that leap.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=354" target="_blank">00:05:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">By then I was married.

But I never really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=360" target="_blank">00:06:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">thought about it in units of risk. I just felt compelled to move on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=365" target="_blank">00:06:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">You've had a wonderful career.

And so we kind of got together. And as we were speaking about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=417" target="_blank">00:06:57.200</a></span> | <span class="t">self-control and mental accounting, I remembered my experience in New York in 1973, '74,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.600</a></span> | <span class="t">soon after we arrived, where the energy crisis came and Con Edison, the utility company of New York,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">had to pay more for the oil they were buying.

And so they had to cut the dividend. And the shareholder meeting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=448" target="_blank">00:07:28.720</a></span> | <span class="t">was really raucous.

Exactly. I just held up your book. This is where this book came from,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">published in 2011. It came from this idea of the second generation of behavioral finance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">where you say, let's talk about what is it that investors really want. Yes, they do want money,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=752" target="_blank">00:12:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">but they also want other things. Yes. Again, it is really important to me. I am using myself as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">a laboratory and I'm looking at experiences and they tell me things. So I remember speaking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">before a presentation in Montreal years ago with an investor, friends of the Hebrew University,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=774" target="_blank">00:12:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">and I said something about mutual funds.

He told me that he is a wealthy man.

Yeah. How was I so stupid? It's ridiculous. And, you know, you have to see that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=841" target="_blank">00:14:01.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I know I am actually taking a lot of risk in the sense that I'm buying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">index funds that go up and down by many thousands each day.

But also,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=2755" target="_blank">00:45:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">perhaps even more important, women have more friends, more social capital than men.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=2762" target="_blank">00:46:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">When women are widowed, they usually have some circle of friends that is going to be there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=2769" target="_blank">00:46:09.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to support them.

When I was reading that, it just became very clear</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=2862" target="_blank">00:47:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">to me that, "Gee, I'm living in a place like this, where we're kind of practicing that."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=2867" target="_blank">00:47:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">But let me move on to divorce. Sometimes things don't work out. What you say is that a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=2875" target="_blank">00:47:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">times, divorce occurs because there wasn't well-being before people got married. In other</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=2881" target="_blank">00:48:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">words, marriage doesn't solve that. If your well-being is low before you get married,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=2886" target="_blank">00:48:06.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the higher probability that you're going to get divorced. Can you explain how all that works?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=2891" target="_blank">00:48:11.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. People who have higher well-being are more likely to attract a mate. They're more optimistic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=2899" target="_blank">00:48:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">for example.

Now, of course, there are going to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=2905" target="_blank">00:48:25.120</a></span> | <span class="t">bumps in every marriage, but being dour and sour is not really a good recipe. But it is important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=2913" target="_blank">00:48:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to know that sometimes it is two good people, two people who can enjoy high well-being. They're just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=2921" target="_blank">00:48:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">not matched right.

The kids get the point. In many cases, if it was obvious that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=2940" target="_blank">00:49:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">parents don't get along when they divorce, kids, in fact, are relieved that they don't have to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=2946" target="_blank">00:49:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">witness that stress every day and they can go to the home of mother and a home of father and have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=2954" target="_blank">00:49:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a better time than when they are together. And so there are really many stories and they go in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=2960" target="_blank">00:49:20.960</a></span> | <span class="t">different directions and people have different views as to what to do. For some people, it is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=2967" target="_blank">00:49:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">you're married, you have kids, you better stay together if they are minor. Other people say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=2974" target="_blank">00:49:34.240</a></span> | <span class="t">no, it just does not make sense for us.

And so I think that what will happen</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=2990" target="_blank">00:49:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to readers of the book is that they're going to see themselves in some of the stories and some of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=2996" target="_blank">00:49:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">the stories will strike them as being strange, but that's good because it kind of prompts thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=3002" target="_blank">00:50:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and you know that you're not alone. And perhaps once you reflect on it, I believe that people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=3009" target="_blank">00:50:09.440</a></span> | <span class="t">can change, you know, people can improve their well-being. That's exactly what happened to me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=3015" target="_blank">00:50:15.040</a></span> | <span class="t">as I was reading through the book. There were some things that just turned me the wrong way. I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=3019" target="_blank">00:50:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't believe that. That's not what I would do. But then there were some things, oh, that's me,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=3024" target="_blank">00:50:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you know. And what you do in the book though is you say, you know, it's not like I'm right and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=3029" target="_blank">00:50:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that other person is wrong. That's not what it is. What enhances my well-being and what enhances that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=3036" target="_blank">00:50:36.240</a></span> | <span class="t">other person's well-being? And what might enhance somebody else's well-being can be completely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=3040" target="_blank">00:50:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">different than what enhances my well-being, but we try to keep everybody within our own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=3045" target="_blank">00:50:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">belief system. And the book really opens that up in many different ways. So it's much more than a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=3051" target="_blank">00:50:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">finance book, but it does all relate to finance. As you were saying, you know, if you have one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=3058" target="_blank">00:50:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">person in a relationship who's a spendthrift or worse, they hide spending and hide debt from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=3065" target="_blank">00:51:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">other spouse. I mean, this is going to eventually blow up. So really interesting observations that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=3071" target="_blank">00:51:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you put way beyond basic behavioral finance that we'd read about.

You wrote that they feel much more stressed with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=3092" target="_blank">00:51:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the extracurricular activities that they're involved in than they do just with their school</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=3097" target="_blank">00:51:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">work.

Many things, many things that surprised me that I found</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=3123" target="_blank">00:52:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">fascinating. And I think that readers will find them fascinating as well. That is why is it that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=3129" target="_blank">00:52:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">there is this big fascination now with getting the kids into an Ivy League college.

It's because they offered me the financial aid that was necessary. So what is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=3153" target="_blank">00:52:33.520</a></span> | <span class="t">going on?

In the US, it is a thing. And it is big, but it's not as big. You can do well even if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHokAE87I3s&t=3191" target="_blank">00:53:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">graduate from a second or third level college.
