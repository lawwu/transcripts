Thank you very much. Bye. Well, you know, it is a universal problem. I think teenagers and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">their usage of these phones is extreme. You know, they do use them all the time. Now there's an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=84" target="_blank">00:01:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting question here before we get to a solution is, okay, what's new about this and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">what's not? I mean, I think it's certainly true that if we went back to the 1980s or the 1990s,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, what you would probably see is that teenagers used to watch a lot of TV.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So they probably were watching as much TV as they could instead of using their phone. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=104" target="_blank">00:01:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">it's not like they were before social media, we should be clear about that, like before social</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">media, they would come home from school and be like, all right, mommy dear, I shall be in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">library.

But if you need me, I will be thinking deeply. And then when social</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=130" target="_blank">00:02:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">media came along, they were gone. Okay. It wasn't like that. But we have to first ask this question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">TV versus what's happening with social media. Is it worse? Is it the same? Is it better?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.600</a></span> | <span class="t">That's the place I want to start. I have my thoughts. Jesse, you and I grew up in a time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.040</a></span> | <span class="t">when it would have been TV at this age. What do you think? More stupefying, but better worse than</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.960</a></span> | <span class="t">four hours of TikTok? Definitely worse. There we go. Yeah. Why does that mean? TV, you would sit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">down and be dedicated, then you could go outside or something. Now they're always bringing the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">phone with them. That's true. And TV was bad. It's not that entertaining. Compare ALF, which was on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">when we were kids, to algorithmically optimized TikTok videos that have been selected based off of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.520</a></span> | <span class="t">a 1,200-point data vector that has been analyzed with recurrent neural networks to figure out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">exactly what to show you that is going to make you want to watch that through to the end. Compare</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">that watching ALF to, "There is a complicated, distressing social dynamic happening at my school</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.720</a></span> | <span class="t">unfolding in these comments on Instagram posts, and people are talking about me, and my standing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">is shifting.

All of that is much more compelling than ALF. And as you're saying,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it can come with you everywhere.

So I think I agree. We have ramped up the invasiveness</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnSa_8qHY8&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and the addictiveness of the tools.
