I'm Tim Chen, and today we're talking about how to be a market researcher. Market research, in my opinion, is a field that often flies under the radar, but is critical to any company in any industry. In high tech, there's a lot of emphasis put on product management, demand generation, business operations, engineering, but you rarely hear about market research. It kind of reminds me of the iPhone. So back in the day, I owned this indestructible little brick called Nokia. These cell phones were all the rage, and it came with all these cool interchangeable covers and accessories. But work started to require more access to email, and then Blackberry became the next big thing. So when the iPhone first came out, I looked at it as pure luxury. Until I got one. Then like everyone else, I never looked back, and I can't imagine life without one. So to me, market research is like that. With it, you can identify market trends, you can gain insight on your competitors, and you can hear directly from your customers about what they actually want by testing new products and services. So if you've ever considered a career in market research, then this episode is for you. Today, we're going to sit down with Tony Tong. He's a senior market research manager at LinkedIn. Not only are you going to get a day in the life of a market researcher, but you're going to get some practical insights on several topics, including when to use primary, secondary, qualitative, and quantitative research, how insights influence the major product decisions at LinkedIn, and how to start a new career as a market researcher. All right, let's get started. Today, we're talking about market research, and joining us is Tony Tong. Tony, how are you doing? I'm doing awesome. Thanks, Tim. Tony, I don't want to make you nervous. I've actually truly been looking forward to this conversation because I'm a huge fan of market research. You know, like companies, we always say that we strive to be customer centric, we put our customers first. We don't really know if you're succeeding in that if you don't hear the voice of the customer. And that's kind of where someone like you in market research comes in. So can you tell us a little bit about what you're doing for market research, how long you've been doing it, and then how it relates to LinkedIn? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So I kind of cringe at this question a little bit because it makes me realize how long I've been doing this. But it has been, as the kids like to say, it's been a minute. I've been in market research almost three decades now. So I started on the agency side, then I worked at Visa for a number of years, and then at Logitech for a short stint, and then currently, I'm at LinkedIn where I've been for the last nine years. So yeah, that's a quick journey. We're seasoned vets, as we say, right? That's right. Cool. So can you help us understand and you can use maybe LinkedIn as an example, but like, what is market research? You know, and what objectives or questions are you trying to solve? And then what are the common types of market research you do? Yeah, yeah. So very simply put, market research is essentially trying to understand what... So I'm going to use the word members because at LinkedIn, we talk about members, but yeah, if you are a company, you might talk about your customers or your consumers, whatnot. But yeah, so at LinkedIn, basically, in terms of market research, we're trying to understand what our members, what their needs are, what their attitudes are towards certain things. And that's really to help kind of inform two major areas. One is like products that we build, and then two is like marketing, how we market to members. And so in terms of market research, at the end of the day, what I'm trying to do is help LinkedIn understand like the needs of our members in terms of products and what that experience on LinkedIn is like, and what kind of tools resonate with them versus what tools that some engineer might want to create, but it's not really resonating with members. And so we try to steer basically our products towards being products that are actually useful for our members. And so that's from a product standpoint. From a marketing standpoint, I also support marketing. Actually, my core stakeholders are typically PMMs, product marketing managers. And so a big part of their job is just trying to understand how to best market to members, what kind of messages like resonate with members. So I'll give you a very quick example. One of the things right now that's new on LinkedIn is this whole idea of verification. So LinkedIn, maybe like a lot of social media platforms, maybe less so than other social media platforms. But one of the things that LinkedIn struggles with is sometimes we have people who are not who they claim to be. And so this idea of verifying like who you are, the fact that you work at Netflix or you work at State Farm, what have you, basically verifying your employment as well as verifying who you are, that's an initiative that's going on right now at LinkedIn. And so in terms of messaging, we're trying to figure out what is that core messaging or that positioning that really will help people sign up to verify that they are who they say they are. So two very high level examples, but yeah, so market research in essence is helping companies understand the needs, the desires, the attitudes of their members, their customers, their consumers. Can you help us understand, maybe even through practical example, I'd love the example you just now used right now, verification. You mentioned you have two stakeholders, one being marketing, one being product. I assume each of those have their own priorities of things that they care about, right? So what does it look like to you, like when you're working with your stakeholders to look at maybe the roadmap of research they want to do, is it categorized by genres, by type? And then how do you then kind of prioritize which one you're going to do? Yeah, that's a great question. So I think that kind of differs depending on the role someone has within market research. So typically I would say what would happen is that on a quarterly basis, a market research manager would get together with people in product, with people in marketing, and for that upcoming quarter, basically talk about what are the core research needs that those teams have, and we'll call them the big rock. So we'll work on those big studies that are usually more strategic questions. But then within those big rocks, there's all sorts of like micro questions that usually come up. And like that's actually a world that I play in pretty heavily. And so for my role, specifically at LinkedIn, I manage what we call an insight community. And the core goal of an insight community is to answer more, they tend to be more tactical questions. So yeah, so in addition to those core, you know, big rocks that we're tackling, we also, you know, we're an internet company, it moves like really quickly, really quickly. So a lot of times you don't have time to spin up like a huge study. And so that's where having like a community at the ready to answer these types of questions is really useful. And the program that I've managed, launched probably six, seven years ago now, and has grown each and every year, it's highly leveraged. But yeah, earlier, you asked like different types of research, and let me sort of backtrack a little bit. Yeah, that'd be great. What I'm talking about right now is called primary research. There's a whole nother world called secondary research. So if you're familiar with like organizations like Forrester or Nielsen, they do what we call secondary research. And the difference between primary research and secondary research is, I'll go back to like Netflix, as an example, if you're in Netflix, one of the questions you have, you might have is like, hey, what are the trends like in streaming? And you and that's a very big question that maybe a lot of like, maybe Disney Plus has those questions, Hulu has those questions. So someone like Forrester may have already done studies about like the landscape of like streaming media, right? So that's secondary research. That's basically research that's broadly applicable. It's at the ready, assuming it's been done already. The other world, I'm getting my hands straight. Primary research is basically specific questions. So like Netflix might have a question that's specific to Netflix, right? So maybe it's something along the lines of, oh, we being Netflix are really curious about the appetite for like Korean dramas outside of Korea, like, do we think that this is like something we should really double down on? Or like, are people like, I don't speak Korean, and therefore, it's not relevant to me. So that's a primary research question. So Netflix might commission a study specifically to answer that question. And so I share that because those are two big worlds of research, primary and then secondary, which is already done. So the world that I'm in is primary research, they're research questions that are specific to LinkedIn, specific to our members, specific to our situation. And then so once you kind of like, those are two big schools, the other two big schools is qualitative research and quantitative research, right? And so qualitative research is things like focus groups, one-on-one interviews. Quantitative research tend to be survey-based research. And I've done both in my career. Right now, I'm more on the survey side, which is more quantitatively based. But there is a path for either someone who wants to specialize in qualitative, someone who wants to specialize in quantitative, or someone who wants to exercise like both parts of those brains, and they kind of exercise different parts of your brains. So it's kind of cool. So there's some variety within the market research realm. And then there's another way to kind of parse this out, which is market research. And then there's user experience research. These are all kind of like primary research, secondary research, qualitative, quantitative. And then I'll stop here. But the last one is market research, traditional market research, and then user experience research, which is another very big branch of research. And so at a 30,000-foot level, user experience research tends-- now, not all of this is 100%, but 90% of the time, it tends to be qualitative. And it's typically about how a single person interacts with your product. Like if I click this, what do you think is going to happen? Is this button in the right place? Like that sort of thing. And then market research is more like at the broad, like hundreds, if not thousands of people level, trying to understand attitudes toward certain things, perceptions of different things, that sort of thing. So that was a lot. My apologies if I went too deep. Those are like three kind of like dichotomous ways of looking at market, looking at research in general. Yeah. And I appreciate that, because that's so important. And I'm thinking about like, companies like LinkedIn, they're large. You can afford to have all the disciplines, right? And I think the smaller you go, I'm thinking even my previous companies, like they would double down in certain areas and try to skate by on the other ones, just based on, again, maybe feedback from customers, maybe that's enough for the kind of usability piece of it. And they kind of focus on something else. So I definitely see the need, ideally, to kind of double down on all of those. Because again, they give you such different insights that can drive business decisions that ultimately impact the customer. And so I appreciate that. I'm kind of curious. So LinkedIn, you mentioned earlier, you have like, there's like 1 billion users right now, or members. Nearly. Yeah. Oh, nearly. So obviously, like when you're running a test, like, typically, what is your size, your pool? And how long does it normally take you to reach statistical significance based on whatever research you're conducting? Yeah. So like in the community that I manage, and then even outside, like for the other market research managers, usually, at the very minimum, you're talking about like 100 plus people per segment to reach statistical significance to be able to say, to make some broad statements. Obviously, the more the better, and the more confidence you have. But usually, at the minimum, we've got about 100 people per segment that we're trying to make statements about. Got it. And what incentives do you use to either get them to participate, or even discover and find them? And find willing participants? Right? Oh, my goodness. So yeah, that's such a great question. And I will say we are very typical, very atypical in the world that I'm in, whereby a lot of market research, either companies or market research groups within many companies will offer an incentive to take a survey. So we in this community, there's no monetary incentive. And so the way we've positioned the community, like, if you want to join the community, it's a very like, reciprocal relationship that we have with them. And so the idea behind the community is that they share back with us their feedback on like some new product idea. And then we share back with them how LinkedIn is going to be better as a result of them having taken part in this research. And so really, their payment is knowing that they're having an impact on their experience on LinkedIn. And this is, I would say it's, it's unique, I wish it was not so unique. I really think that that is one of the ways that market research can thrive. And I think that's one of the things that the industry needs to strive more for is not so much like paying people 5-10 bucks for for their time, because what we don't want at the end of the day is like a professional survey taker. That's just gonna give us like, you know, five, five, five, five, like they're not, they're not really thinking about it. Like what I'm trying to do in this program that I manage at LinkedIn is basically offer value back to them. That's not monetary, it's actually worth much more than 5-10 bucks. It's basically, help me help you on LinkedIn, help me help, help me be the voice of you so that we can make better products for you that fit what you're looking for in your career. Yeah, that's really helpful. And in the B2B world, like there's, you might hear like partner champion programs or customer reference programs or brand advocates, and that's similar. But I agree with you that detaching some kind of monetary reward, instead, instead of focusing on like making them feel like they're a part of your roadmap, is actually not only do you get better feedback from them, but they actually develop a closer tie and relationship to your brand because now they feel invested in having contributed to that. So that's, I agree. Yeah, if more companies can do that, I think that'd be awesome. Now, opportunity kind of fucks your muscles though here, Tony, like, I personally know you and how like awesome you are. Can you give me some examples of some really big wins you've had that, whether influenced major strategy or decisions within a company, or maybe even from a product side, influenced or implemented major product feature? Yeah, yeah. Oh my goodness. I just, I just came back. I'm sweating a little bit, not because of this interview. I love like talking to you, Tim. I actually came back from a Muay Thai kickboxing class that I'm taking right now, so I'm still like in the aftermath of that, but anyhow, no, back to back on topic. I've got, I've got two examples I would share with you, things that I'm proud of in terms of how talking to our members actually shaped what LinkedIn did, hopefully for the better. And so about a year ago, LinkedIn was trying to, was trying to break out of this, of this idea that it's all, like LinkedIn has to be all about work, 100% about work. And what we, what we're trying to do is trying to be more holistic in terms of, yes, we never want to be Facebook. Like, let's get that like out of the way, right? We do not want to be Facebook, but we recognize that like there's a whole bunch of stuff operating like on our periphery that affects our careers, affects our work life. And so one of the studies that I did was basically about what types of content do you want to see on LinkedIn? And so in addition to those things that you might expect, like interviewing tips or negotiating tips or networking, you know, guides or things like that, there was a lot of things that were kind of like on the periphery of like your, your professional life. And one of the things that one of those items was mental health. And so mental health amongst like a whole bunch of other things that were not traditionally professional topics of discussion on LinkedIn, that was the one that really came out as being an area where our members wanted to talk about that and, and gave LinkedIn permission to talk about that. And so it was awesome. So like our editor in chief, Daniel Roth got, you know, was, was very interested in these results being the editor of content on LinkedIn. And so he told me that, oh my goodness, Tony, this is awesome because like this is the area that we've been wanting to get into, but just wasn't sure whether we really would have permission from our members to talk about mental health on LinkedIn. And fast forward a year, like I don't think it would be out of the ordinary to see mental health conversations take place on LinkedIn, how people are managing it, how people are coping with it as it relates to professional lives. And so that was based on a study that where I don't know that we would have dared to venture in that area had it not been the, the, the guidance from our members through the community study that talked about that, where they shared that they were willing to, to see that conversation, to participate in that conversation. So, so that's, that's one example that I'm pretty proud of in the last year. And that's an example where member feedback gave us permission or gave us the go ahead to do something. I'll share another example. This is actually the opposite is where we chose not to do something because members said that is not what we wanted to do. So the context for this next example is, is this idea of sharing your, your thoughts on LinkedIn anonymously. And so at the time we call this like masked identity, right? So the idea behind it, the positive idea behind it is that someone may not be willing or brave enough to share their thoughts for risk of cancellation or their boss seeing it, what have you. They're just not comfortable sharing some thought on LinkedIn. And so the idea was like, Hey, what if we gave members the ability to share this anonymously? And so one of the things we've been doing within the insight community is a lot is, is, is concept testing and concept testing in a very consistent way so that we have a benchmark in terms of whether 62% of audiences liking something, is that good? Is that bad? And so we have like a benchmark of of like the average concept. And so anyways, this whole idea of being able to share anonymously was our lowest performing concepts. And so it was a very clear sign that, well, while I, well, I think we all understand the rationale behind it, it's something that our members like, like, no. And the number one reason, as you might guess, is that they did not want LinkedIn to turn into like into Reddit where people like to say whatever they want to say without recourse or without a second thought. And so we, that's an example of where like market research saved us from going in a direction that that maybe we may have without member guidance. Yeah, I think that's, I would have agreed with that result as well. I think I would have voted the same like it that the unique thing about LinkedIn is like taking ownership of what you say and that that kind of representing and reflecting on you as an individual, usually, hopefully for the better, right, but can obviously go the other direction. And being able to like, do it in a masked way can result in a lot of content that's probably not maybe even professional on this. Yeah, like very much of LinkedIn is all based on the reliability of your profile, right? You are, you are, you're proud of what you're saying, what you're putting out in the world. So I think this kind of went against that. Cool. So talking back about the fundamentals of market research, you know, like, can you help me understand what skills are, do hiring managers look for or skills that someone brings to the table that are, are paramount for succeeding in this role? And I'm kind of thinking about different kinds of people, right? So one audience could be someone who is maybe looking to transition into market research and trying to figure out, do their skills translate to maybe an entry level role? And there's the other side of it, which is like, you're a practitioner and you're trying to become an even more seasoned expert. So can you kind of help us kind of get a little bit of the land of what to look out for? Yeah, yeah, I, it's a great question. I, I'm trying to think about this conversation, how I like, honestly, I'm trying to think about like, how can I add like unique value? Because anyone can kind of like chat GPT or Google, like, what are the core skills of like a market researcher? And I think a lot of things will come down, like analytical skills and Excel skills and presentation skills and that sort of thing. I, I would like to take a step back and like, just in my experience, like specifically, if you want to kind of differentiate yourself, it's so much about the soft skills and just being able to like relate to people, to have a genuine curiosity for why people do the things they do, why they like the things they like, why they don't like the things that they don't like. It's being very comfortable, like in a collaborative environment. This, this, this job is very much like a people person job. It's like a team oriented job. Like I'm at any one point in time, I'm usually working with some combination of PMMs, PMs, product managers, brand people, operational people, biz ops people, and, and it's very much a cross functional team effort. It's also important that I should be a little cautious about saying this, but I'm going to say it because that's kind of how I see it. You should be comfortable being a supporter at the end of the day. You're very much in a supportive function of like product and marketing. You're trying to help product shine. You're trying to help marketing shine. There's moments for you to shine as a market research expert as well, but ultimately you're part of a greater team. So I think like it's this whole being comfortable with that, being like being that, being like the place where you want to be, where you're kind of wired that way. I think it's helpful. So all those sort of like soft skills are helpful along with like being analytical and like learning research methodology. I'll dive back more into like the more practical side of things too. So like research methodology, yeah, you could learn it from, you know, like from books or like resources online, practically speaking. And I think that's kind of will be pertinent to people who are interested in a career in market research. I tend to think that it's great to start on the, on the agency side. So like earlier I had all those like, you know, this or that. So in market research, you could be on the agent, you can be on the agency side, which is basically a market research agency that is providing market research services to a whole plethora of clients. Or you could be on the client side. You could work like within a market research department, like within a Netflix or a state farm or what have you. So I, my, my strong recommendation is if you're first starting out, this is how I started as well is to start on the agency side, because on the agency side, you learn all sorts of different research methodologies. That's where I learned to do both quantitative and qualitative research. They all have like their nuances. They all have their specialties within those broad sectors. You also get to learn to work with different industries. So when I was on the agency side, I was very fortunate to work with an agency that had really like great clients. So at any one point in time, I was working with like Microsoft and EA and Adobe, but at the same time, I was also working with Pillsbury and Dreyer's ice cream, and then like a whole other sphere with all sorts of like insurance or visa finances or something like that. So I highly suggest like starting out like on the agency side if, yeah, if you're able to, because that's where you can get a lot of different experiences. I would totally agree with that. And that's actually how I started my career in digital marketing as well. And to your point, you get to experience breadth, and then depth and the ability to move around because like within agencies, they also kind of depends on how big or small they are. But everyone kind of needs to kind of pitch in and apply to various disciplines. And to your point, it gives you exposure, either direct exposure or observing someone else doing it, and you kind of passively kind of kind of grow that skill set, even though you're not practicing it. So that's a really, really good call out. I'm even thinking, I'm hoping this is unique to this current market today, right? But like, right now, like, leveraging external resources versus hiring for internal, there's obviously the current economy is harder for people to hire dedicated market researchers. So you might just naturally find more opportunity on an agency right now, as it is, again, I'm really hoping that this market kind of turns itself around, but that's kind of where I'm seeing a shift. And it applies to digital marketing as well. I'm seeing those trends, too. Yeah, so I really appreciate that. It actually gives me a lot of hope, quite frankly, Tony, because I don't know if I ever admitted this to you. About like two years ago, I was like, considering a career change as well. I was like, Oh, man, can I do some market research? And I was like, Oh, no, no. I know, Tony, I don't want to look like an idiot to him. I don't want to ask, but it but part of the things that caused me to not want to reach out to you besides pride, or whatever I call it, is just, I want to make it look like I've got my stuff together. And I was afraid that I didn't. And what you're telling me here, which is really helpful is like, yes, there's some hard skills, you definitely need to know. But the the soft skills part is so important. And that's, I think, something that a non practitioner has. And so I think if you're listening to this video, and that's where you find yourself, like, don't be discouraged from considering market research at all, as a matter of fact, like maybe lean into it a little bit, because your natural skills might actually kind of take you ahead. And you just would know if you don't give yourself a chance. Cool. So Tony, can you help us understand just just career growth in market research? Like, like, what does an entry level position normally look like? And what is for someone like in your role, who's been kind of obviously more seasoned? Like, what does growth look like? Yeah. So I can I can speak to my own career, which I think is a is a fairly linear path that someone could follow. So like I said, I started on the agency side. And I started out being as I worked on in a market research agency, but not so much in a market research specific role. So my role was that of a we call it a data coordinator. And so the whole idea is that I worked with a lot of market research managers to basically get the data from the research studies into like PowerPoint decks. And so I did that I did a lot of that. And so I did that for about a year. And then after a while, I had an opening for an assistant research manager. And obviously just be kind of marinating in that world for a while, like I became an assistant research manager, realize I loved it, like I was very much in my sweet spot. And by sweet spot, I mean, I'll take you back to college real quick. I didn't declare a major until I think my junior year. And I knew I wanted to do something in marketing, but I didn't feel I was creative enough to do marketing. But I also knew I love my psychology classes. So market research and psychology, psychology, and, and marketing kind of like fits, it kind of becomes market research. Yeah. And so I knew that's what I wanted to do. And so sure enough, like in that first legitimate market research role, I really felt like, yes, like this is what I wanted to do. I had a curiosity for people, I was kind of okay with numbers. I'm Asian, I hate math, I'm doing okay, but I'm not I'm not a mathematician, not a mathematician. So don't let the word the fact I'm using the word data, this is very straightforward data that very is very basic data. So so yeah, so from from being an assistant research manager became research manager. And then from from the agency side, I went to visa, where I got to experience life on the on the client side, which has a lot of benefits. So in terms of growth, I would say, my apologies, if I'm jumping back. No, this is perfect. You're doing great. One of the things that what growth may look one of the dimensions of growth is how much visibility do you have to the person actually making use of your data and the insights from your studies. So like, when I was a data coordinator, I had zero visibility, I they hid me in the back room in the corner somewhere. And then as an as an assistant research manager, I was like the silent person in the room. So like the research managers interfacing with the client, I'm there like taking notes, doing the best that I can not to look like if like a fool not to say anything stupid. And then when I became a research manager, then I like had amassed enough knowledge enough confidence to to be able to talk to the clients. And then when I became a senior research manager, that's when I made the jump from being able to talk the language to being able to consult and like, and to basically translate like their business questions into research solutions. So earlier, like, let's say like, we were, let's say we're working on Netflix, and Netflix had the question of, hey, should we double down on Korean content like outside of Korea? And so I'd be as a research manager, I would have to come up with like the proper research solution. Is it is a primary research? Is it secondary research? Is it quantitative? Is it qualitative? And then like, so on down the line, and so I would be able to like consult on that. And then so from there, I left and went to the to the client side at Visa. And then when you're on the client side, you're even closer yet to the people who are acting on it, right? Because on the agency side, you may be working with you may be working with a market researcher at the client, not even the people who are making use of that data, that study. And so when you're on the client side, you're working with the PMMs, you're working with the product, the people who are making the products, you're working with, yeah, the people who are basically implementing the studies that that you're you're executing on. And so, yeah, I would say that's probably one dimension, that's the one that comes that's most apparent to me, it's just kind of like, how, how removed or how close at the hip are you to the people? How much of a partner are you to those people who are actually doing it and executing on on the studies? Yeah, that's really good, actually, that you even kind of hinted at another skill set here, which is, I don't know if it's a software hard skill set, but the ability to take a lot of information, and then distill it down and framed in a way that can be used in research, right? Because again, like, someone can have like five disparate ideas, and they think it's one singular thought for a business objective, and you're like, actually, maybe, maybe it's being able to ask the right questions to kind of get to the crux of what you want, and then taking that and framing it into a test, I think that that ability to kind of logically work through that is probably really good. And I liked also the part we talked about, like how you engage with people, I think about even my own career, right, the, the, there's a lot of ways where you can show value to either a peer or a manager, right? One of them is like, because you sit so close to the data to the research, providing value could look like, hey, I've noticed something else in the data that might be worth looking at, or have we considered this or when someone comes to you with a research idea, maybe, as you kind of help them qualify or, or substantiate the request, maybe there's a different way of looking at it. And those questions, while they may not become executed upon, like that sets you apart as well, right? That's providing value. I think those are the kind of thinking mechanisms or skill sets that I at least look for when I'm looking for direct, for even junior folks, like if they show that I'm like, oh, that's like kind of rockstar quality, because you're coachable, right, and that attitude is important. Yeah. Yeah. So that, that, that kind of speaks to like, to another continuum too, right? If it's not evident, I love these continuum, but I'm also working on my camera, spatial skills here. It's a continuum between like, just like supplying data versus like making sense of data and then like, kind of like, you know, driving value from that data. Yeah. Cool. So this question, maybe closing question for you is just like, you know, if you think of a typical person, maybe who's trying to consider a new career in market research, like you should consider a market research if blank, you know, or maybe you should not consider it for blank, like what would those look like to you? Yeah. So I think first and foremost is just like a natural curiosity for, for human behavior. I think more because at the end of the day, a lot of this is just being intellectually curious about why people think the way they do. So that's part of it. So intellectual curiosity, you know, earlier I talked about like the team orientation, you're part of like a broader team to accomplish something. You're not like a soul, like Lone Ranger, Rockstar out there. You're part of a collective effort. So it's, it's good for someone who's, who, who functions that way and it's comfortable in those environments. You have to be a good communicator, both verbally as well as written. There's a lot of like communication, presentations, that sort of thing. So like communications, and that's not just market research. I think I'll serve you well in any, in any, any discipline. There's probably a ton more, but I would kind of stop there. Yeah. I think it's good. It's really helpful. And like, I really enjoyed this conversation today, Tony. I think you have a lot of really good insights on like how to practice the skill and industry of market research. But I think you're kind of your real life applications kind of really helps humanize the experience. And I think in a way that people can relate to and, and for those viewers out there who are trying to consider a career, like hopefully this inspired you to maybe dig deep or do some research and learn more about it. I definitely think as a seasoned professional, you gave them a lot of things to think about. I think areas to hone the craft and maybe they, you actually identified the six areas essentially of market, of research and maybe other areas that maybe other muscles they want to flex because maybe they've been overly focused on market research. Maybe I'll do something else within the research field. So I think this is really good. Tony, thank you for your time and hopefully you can come back soon and talk about something else. Yeah, absolutely. 100. And before we go, like, I think I'm in a season of my life where I mentioned I'm almost like in market research for 30 years. So I think I'm very much in a season of giving back. So if any of your viewers like wanted to talk market research, working at LinkedIn, what have you, in more depth, happy, reach out to me on LinkedIn and happy to chat. How can they find you on LinkedIn? Just Tony Tong, market research should do it. Cool. All right. Thanks a lot, Tony. Have a great day. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
