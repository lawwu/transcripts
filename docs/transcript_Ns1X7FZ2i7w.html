So you're extracting a piece of the whole food and then taking these individual pieces of whole foods that really weren't meant to exist in isolation together and re-putting them together into what I would call a frankenfood.</p><p>So something that never could exist. So it's not like it's cooked, or it's squished, or blended, and mixed with other whole foods to make something new. Basically, when you get to ultra-processed foods, it's when you've taken out individual constituent components of a whole food and then repackaged them together.</p><p>So what you're going to see on labels-- and fundamentally, this has come down to we all need to read all the labels on the food we're eating. Because if we think about the food as the bricks to re-3D print our bodies and also the instruction manuals for ourselves, we realize why we have to read labels.</p><p>Because we want to know what impact we're going to have on our body of tomorrow. And that's why we read labels. 'cause it's like, this is who we're gonna be tomorrow.</p></div></div></body></html>
