There are definitely in-store only deals. We talked about Kroger and Safeway. Those are examples where the good stuff is going to be in store. From my perspective, as a middleman who's trying to make money on reselling gift cards, my favorite deals are like hyper-regional local grocery stores.</p><p>We track deals even from individual stores. There's like five stores in Utah that we track that occasionally have great deals. So oftentimes it's these obscure local grocery chains will sometimes have killer gift card deals, and you have to go in-person, in-store to get those deals. That being said, there's plenty of online stuff, as we already talked about, the apps and giftcards.com and things like that.</p><p>There's deals in both places. But if you think about Economics 101 and Supply and Demand, if there's a deal that's only available at five stores in Utah and you live next to one of those stores, then the market, if you plan to resell those gift cards, will be much more favorable because you'll be the only supplier of them.</p></div></div></body></html>
