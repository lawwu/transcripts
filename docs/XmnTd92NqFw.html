First one is coding. And as you can see, BARD refuses to do coding. They actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=56" target="_blank">00:00:56.340</a></span> | <span class="t">mentioned this in the FAQ that BARD won't do coding for you. As it says, I'm designed solely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to process and generate text. As you can see, it's a fairly basic coding challenge and BARD won't do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.700</a></span> | <span class="t">it. GPT-4 had no such qualms and the code worked first time. Of course, I did check it and it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=73" target="_blank">00:01:13.300</a></span> | <span class="t">worked, but this was just a simple challenge to turn letters into numbers. Next, and even worse</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.700</a></span> | <span class="t">for BARD, it can't summarize PDFs.

By the way, it didn't admit that it couldn't summarize the PDF. It summarized a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.340</a></span> | <span class="t">completely different PDF.

Of course, the GPT-4 accessed via OpenAI also can't do this because it can't access the web. It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=101" target="_blank">00:01:41.720</a></span> | <span class="t">also picked a completely different paper, but our old friend Bing could indeed read the PDF and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.280</a></span> | <span class="t">summarize it. Okay, what about summarization when I literally paste in the text that I need it to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.300</a></span> | <span class="t">summarize? Imagine you want to summarize a meeting via Google Meets or shorten an email thread in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Gmail. It has to get this right. I pasted in the same New York Times article into BARD and GPT-4,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.900</a></span> | <span class="t">and I am sad to say that BARD fluffed its lines. The link to the article will be in the description,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.340</a></span> | <span class="t">but I've read it carefully and it makes numerous mistakes. Let me scroll down and show you this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.580</a></span> | <span class="t">erroneous summary. First, it says the Fed is expected to raise interest rates, but doesn't say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.880</a></span> | <span class="t">by whom. Second, it starts chatting about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.280</a></span> | <span class="t">full employment and inflation. Not only is full employment not mentioned in the article at all,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.780</a></span> | <span class="t">it also gets both numbers wrong. The unemployment rate in America isn't currently 3.8% and inflation</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=159" target="_blank">00:02:39.140</a></span> | <span class="t">isn't at 7.9%. I checked these against the latest data and you can check it yourself,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">but both are wrong. BARD also keeps going on tangents, like stocks are typically considered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.760</a></span> | <span class="t">to be riskier investments than bonds. Okay, that's fine, but why are you teaching me financial advice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.520</a></span> | <span class="t">you're supposed to be summarizing an article? Honestly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.260</a></span> | <span class="t">it was a pretty unusable summary. So bad that to be honest, you'd have been better off just not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">reading it. Trust me, I am not an open AI fanboy, but its model is just better currently. Notice how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in its summary, it doesn't go on tangents and it clarifies that it's investors who think that there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.460</a></span> | <span class="t">will be a quarter point increase. The five bullet points are succinct and accurate. This is a pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.200</a></span> | <span class="t">colossal loss for BARD. What about light content creation and idea generation? Surely it could do</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.760</a></span> | <span class="t">well here. Just something in a sense. BARD is a pretty good example of how BARD can be used to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.240</a></span> | <span class="t">create new content, like create eight new YouTube video ideas with titles and synopses on integrating</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.800</a></span> | <span class="t">generative AI into retail. If BARD can't be used by analysts, maybe it can be used by content</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">creators. Not really. I mean, you make your own mind up, but these titles are pretty repetitive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.340</a></span> | <span class="t">and bland. I know I can't really complain because my channel name is AI Explained, but these titles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">are just unoriginal and these synopses lack detail. I'll let you read these, but compare them to GPT-4's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.220</a></span> | <span class="t">outputs. Each title is different and the ideas are much more explored and nuanced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, fine. What about email composition? And I have to say, count me a skeptic on this one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I have never found that any model, let alone BARD, can do a decent job at this. It's not always that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the emails are bad. It's just that the time it takes me to teach the model what I want to say</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.720</a></span> | <span class="t">in my email, I could have just written the email. I'm going to make a prediction at this point. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">don't think using language models to do emails is going to become that common. Of course, feel free</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=266" target="_blank">00:04:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">to quote me on this in a year's time. Now, you're probably thinking I'm being harsh. This is a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.660</a></span> | <span class="t">perfectly fine email. I did leave a thumbs up. It's just that I would never use BARD for this purpose.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And I would also never use GPT-4. Like, I don't want it to make up all these extra details about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=281" target="_blank">00:04:41.640</a></span> | <span class="t">what I'm going to discuss with John.

No, I haven't. I never mentioned anything about data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.180</a></span> | <span class="t">and graphs.

It's an okay email, but look at the length of it. I could have just written</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it out. Would have been quicker to do the email than the prompt.

I picked a paragraph that someone I know used for a personal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.620</a></span> | <span class="t">statement to get into university. Of course, they were happy for me to share it. It's decently</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.040</a></span> | <span class="t">written, but could be improved significantly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=326" target="_blank">00:05:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">I asked BARD, rewrite this paragraph with better English, make it original,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.560</a></span> | <span class="t">professional, and impactful. Now BARD did remove some of the errors, but it again went on a wild</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.480</a></span> | <span class="t">tangent, trying to sell a career in data science, as if we were some sort of recruiter. Now I'm not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=342" target="_blank">00:05:42.540</a></span> | <span class="t">going to be too harsh. If you just take the first paragraph, it's okay. GPT-4's output is better,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=348" target="_blank">00:05:48.900</a></span> | <span class="t">but still has some problems.

I said, "Rephrase this text with smoother language." It seemed to like that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and then did the job. I think it's the best output, but still has problems. Anyway,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmnTd92NqFw&t=380" target="_blank">00:06:20.320</a></span> | <span class="t">this is not a grammar lesson, so let's move to science and physics.
