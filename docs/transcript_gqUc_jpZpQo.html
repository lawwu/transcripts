I'm Luan Johnson, pastor of Grace Bible Church of Oxnard. All right, and Luan, you've been reading the LSB for a bit. What do you think? Love the LSB. And it's clear, it's simple, and my family loves it. So I had no choice but to jump on it fully.</p><p>How long have you been preaching from it? I've been preaching from it now for about six months and trying to get our church adjusted from the NASB 95 into the legacy. So it's been a very smooth transition. And has there been a particular passage that you've really enjoyed, the highlights of the LSB, where accuracy or precision, consistency comes into play?</p><p>It's in Jude, I believe it's verse 5, 6, where it talks about in the NASB, it says the Lord has delivered a people from slavery, from Egypt, but the LSB uses Jesus, which is a more accurate translation. Yeah, I like that a lot. Thanks for sharing with us. Appreciate it.</p><p>You're very welcome. Thank you. And how many LSB Bibles do you own? I'm going to just say this. My wife tells me there's greater addictions in the world than mine. So I'll just leave it at that. Thank you.</p></div></div></body></html>
