The reason dovetails with what exactly I said previously.</p><p>The stock market is unpredictable, especially in the short term, and I define the short term as anything less than three years. However, if you can keep your money in the S&P 500 for a period of five years, the odds of you earning a positive real return, real meaning after the effects of inflation, are actually very high.</p><p>The number is about 80%. So you have an 80% chance, if you can keep your money in the stock market for five years or longer, of earning a positive real return. That to me is an acceptable level of risk to take on, although everybody is different.
