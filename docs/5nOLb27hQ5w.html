So at Dawn, we help some of the best companies in the world, everyone from GitHub</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=52" target="_blank">00:00:52.740</a></span> | <span class="t">to Can of Soup build better, more predictable AI products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.560</a></span> | <span class="t">My entire life, I've been really obsessed with building and designing unbounded products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=70" target="_blank">00:01:10.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So unbounded products are products that transcend the mouse, the monitor in some way, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=81" target="_blank">00:01:21.380</a></span> | <span class="t">So for me, that started with robotics. I think the first one was when I was in eighth grade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Eventually, rockets at SpaceX. So these are very unbounded products. And then most recently,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I was on the design team for the Apple Vision Pro for four years. So we designed the first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.020</a></span> | <span class="t">version of Vision OS. I think that AI makes products less bounded than they've ever been, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=121" target="_blank">00:02:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">You can type, you can talk, you can show images or show video just like we just saw. You can also sort of plead, you can bargain, you can confide, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">These are very interesting sort of input modalities. And this unboundedness often makes products unpredictable, right? Confusing, hard to understand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Users assume your product can do things that it can't. They try to do those things. Doesn't work. And they walk away thinking that it can't even do the things that it can't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">When you talk to people, and specifically people that are not in this room, how they use ChatGPT, how they learn how to use it, it's often word of mouth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=176" target="_blank">00:02:56.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Right? So they hear one of their friends say that they used it for travel planning, and then they go use it for travel planning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.160</a></span> | <span class="t">A lot of us, a lot of us in this room, especially like people that are more technical, we often learn through trial and error, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So we just keep trying, keep trying. We keep trying because we know that these models are good, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=193" target="_blank">00:03:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">We know that it's impressive. But a lot of people are not. They don't do the trial and error thing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=198" target="_blank">00:03:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So they try it once. That doesn't work. They don't try good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, this talk is about making good AI products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And to that end, I'm going to cover just three things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=214" target="_blank">00:03:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So those three things are the past, right? So how have products become more unbounded, and what has worked for unbounded products in the past?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The present, which is AI products today. What are sort of good design patterns and bad design patterns?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then the third point is going to be the future, right? So again, just three things. Just the past, the present, and the future. Easy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's start with the past. So most software that we use lives on a screen, right? And you use it just by typing--</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">sorry, you use it primarily by swiping, clicking, and tapping, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">When you click something, whatever the developer expected to happen is what happens, depending on how good of a developer you are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's easy for users to understand what your app can do. They look. They see the buttons. They get it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's also very easy for you to understand what your users are doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You just add an amplitude or mix panel call on a button press. You see what they did.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you think about one of the biggest changes to this, previous to the last two years, was multi-touch, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is just like, instead of one pointer, you have two. But just by adding that second pointer, you get relative distance. You get rotation, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And just this one little change, like, largely made the smartphone possible, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, largely made it easy to use a screen that is that small.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And now it's just getting crazy, right? It's like we have unbounded products everywhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=320" target="_blank">00:05:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The products are so unbounded. You have software, you know, just freely roaming the streets of San Francisco, getting attacked by fiery mobs, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is getting crazy. And so I want to talk a little bit about just one unbounded product that I got to work on, which is the Vision Pro.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And what I want to talk about is just three lessons that we learned while we were designing it, lessons that I think aren't as intuitive looking from the outside in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=351" target="_blank">00:05:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think that unbounded products are often defined by this "what if" question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, when we were starting, it's like users get themselves into the craziest situations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=364" target="_blank">00:06:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So something as simple as, oh, well, what if someone's in the living room and then they move to the bedroom and they lay down on their bed, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=370" target="_blank">00:06:10.920</a></span> | <span class="t">What should happen to your apps? If you're designing Mac OS that's on a laptop, you don't have to worry about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But that's something we had to think about. And there's hundreds of more questions like this, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=381" target="_blank">00:06:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">What if someone's on a plane? What if someone's next to their friend?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.920</a></span> | <span class="t">What if someone has a disability of some sort, right? Like, they cannot move. They can't move their neck. They're bedridden.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=391" target="_blank">00:06:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So all of these what ifs. And I think this is, again, what defines unbounded products, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">All of us that are building AI products, we're constantly thinking, you know, oh, like, what if someone puts in this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">What if someone puts in that? And there's evals, et cetera, et cetera.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=406" target="_blank">00:06:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so without structure, you just have chaos, right? You have a blank slate. You have all these what ifs, infinite world of possibilities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's really on us as product designers to add structure. And structure is what creates clarity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=423" target="_blank">00:07:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, I want to talk about three ways we added structure. The first was highlighting what matters and doing it really fast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=431" target="_blank">00:07:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So the first thing you see in Vision OS is a home screen. It has apps, it has people, and it has environments.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So those are the things that we think matter when you're using Vision OS. So they're the first thing you see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It might not sound that novel, and it's not. In a lot of ways, it's the same thing that happens on your iPhone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=452" target="_blank">00:07:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But when you compare it to VR products that came before, it's very hard to understand how you're actually, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.920</a></span> | <span class="t">what is this thing good for when you look at this menu. The second point is hierarchy. Hierarchy is what gives unbounded products a shape and a purpose, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=476" target="_blank">00:07:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's what helps users understand what it's good for, what they should use it for. So again, we have the home menu.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=483" target="_blank">00:08:03.920</a></span> | <span class="t">That's kind of where everything starts and ends for Vision OS. We have windows. They have bounds. You can resize them and move them. And any individual window can go full screen, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=500" target="_blank">00:08:20.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So that was our hierarchy. The last point, which is really important, and I think the easiest way to make unbounded products feel familiar is -- sorry, intuitive. I got ahead of myself. It's familiar. Familiarity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It was something we hit when we were building dawn. Our first kind of prototype was this star cluster thing that you could explore. It was really fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=525" target="_blank">00:08:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Nowadays, it looks a lot more like this, which are, you know, tables. And we have graphs and examples. Again, it's just structure, clarity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=535" target="_blank">00:08:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think that it's no accident that, you know, the TV app on Vision OS looks a lot like the TV app on TV OS, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not an accident. It wasn't laziness. When people are sort of in uncharted territory, you want to give them as many signs of home as possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=561" target="_blank">00:09:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's not an accident. It's an accident, right? And it's not an accident. Same thing for Control Center, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">When people see Vision OS, they already know how to use it. So again, these three points. Highlighting what matters, bringing that to the forefront, establishing hierarchy, and then leveraging familiarity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. And so that was the past. Now we're going to talk about the present. And specifically, we're going to talk about the present.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">We're going to talk about AI products. We're going to talk about ways, both good and bad, that products have been incorporating structure into their AI features.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=606" target="_blank">00:10:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's really important to note the right structure is very unique to your app, right? That's the whole point, is that it gives your app a shape. It helps your user understand what it's actually for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=619" target="_blank">00:10:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's take something like Dot, right? Dot is a companion. Dot is sort of a journal, at least for me. And so the structure they added was that if you pinch out, you can see each day separated, right? It feels a lot like a journal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=637" target="_blank">00:10:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you tap a person or two people, in this case my co-founders, I can see this, again, structured information about them and a timeline every time I mention them to Dot. And so again, you're pulling that structure out of the chat.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it does a really good job of using structure to make their experience feel more like a search engine and less like ChatCPT, less like a chat you're having a conversation with, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=664" target="_blank">00:11:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And they do this by, you know, really pulling your title, you know, your query up top as like a title, you know, highlighting the sources it came from, and then having the answer below that, right? And then having that take up the full page kind of regardless.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So it makes it feel, again, like more like one shot, less something you're having a back and forth with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Now I want to talk about sort of an anti-pattern I've seen, which is this is in the Vercel chatbot demo.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I think Vercel does some of the coolest design work in the entire world. I didn't like this one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is like having this idea of almost ephemeral UI, but inside the flow of chat, right? And I get the appeal, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=710" target="_blank">00:11:50.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So actually, if we go back here, sorry, this was a video I want to show, you know, you have a slider, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So instead of having to like, you inquire about, you know, you want to buy Doge, and it shows you this UI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=721" target="_blank">00:12:01.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can adjust exactly how many instead of having to do it over text. It's, you know, could be good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=726" target="_blank">00:12:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The problem is that when it's stuck inside this sort of unstructured thing, it starts like floating away as I try to ask follow-ups, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then at some point, I even have two of them, right? So I go back up to the first one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=739" target="_blank">00:12:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I press purchase, and now I'm interacting with something that's completely different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So it reminds me a lot of sort of the house in up, right? It's just kind of up, up, away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=748" target="_blank">00:12:28.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So instead of trying to put structure stuff into this unstructured thing, I think the answer is you pull it out, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">You pull it off to the side. And what that means is that as the conversation continues, you can just sort of update that structure without disrupting where the user is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's exactly what Claude did with artifacts, right? And I think why it's so successful is that they pulled out the structure, which is the app you're working on and iterating on, from the actual conversation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then so as you make changes, you can even go between the versions here without even having to scroll in the conversation, right? So it's beautiful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And it actually brings us to another thing that I think has been really effective for AI apps, which is this almost concept of version control.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So this was actually one of the shipping, like, original Chat CPT features, which is kind of crazy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=801" target="_blank">00:13:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you edit a message, you can go between the versions, right? And it actually maintains this entire tree.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.920</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very complicated. But it's super powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">With v0, Vercel did something, again, amazing, where it feels extremely familiar, almost like you're working on Google Slides or something.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=819" target="_blank">00:13:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But you can go back and iterate, keep iterating on UI without having to be afraid that you're losing something, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=826" target="_blank">00:13:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, versions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, I think familiarity is really one of the most important things for unbounded products.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I think Claude did an excellent job with this. Again, I'm hyping them up here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But Chat CPT introduced memory across all of your chats, right? Completely unbounded.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=846" target="_blank">00:14:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So when I tell it something about, you know, some sort of medical problem as I'm working on a JavaScript,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">it's like, you know, it knows that, which is very weird to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this idea of projects and that structure of a project is very familiar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=858" target="_blank">00:14:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So sharing context across a project makes more sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Agents are something that are extremely unfamiliar to most people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And this idea of having, you know, all these different tasks and you're feeding data between steps, whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But you know what is familiar are spreadsheets, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Spreadsheets are extremely familiar to -- not to me, actually, but to a lot of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=882" target="_blank">00:14:42.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the only real uses of agents I've seen in the world, in the real world, are spreadsheets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is Clay, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=894" target="_blank">00:14:54.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And each column is essentially a step that an agent is taking, the user is defining.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's going across, building up kind of context across the spreadsheet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=902" target="_blank">00:15:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Each row, it's often almost -- you do it like an eval, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=907" target="_blank">00:15:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like you run the first 10 rows and then you run the next 50,000, 100,000, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So you get it right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=913" target="_blank">00:15:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can see here, eventually, you end up with a personalized email as the last column.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But with all these steps in between.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">The next thing that I think is extremely effective in helping people understand what your app is for,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=930" target="_blank">00:15:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and skipping all the sort of noise of prompt hacking, prompt engineering, are examples and presets.</span></div><div class="c"><span

everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1071" target="_blank">00:17:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think sparse autoencoders show a really promising path towards that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1076" target="_blank">00:17:56.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you guys have tried Golden Gate Claude, where you can kind of identify the one feature of Golden Gate Bridge-ness and amplify it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1085" target="_blank">00:18:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and it makes Claude obsessed with Golden Gate Bridges specifically, or the Golden Gate Bridge.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">My friend Gittes has an amazing demo towards this, but for manipulating images, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1096" target="_blank">00:18:16.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see here he's increasing the amount of play of light and shadows, increasing the amount of serene forest streams or Venetian canals,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in, again, a very controllable and predictable way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1109" target="_blank">00:18:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, but -- so now we have a million, billion options, whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1112" target="_blank">00:18:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">How do we avoid too many options?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1116" target="_blank">00:18:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I think this gets to point three, which is ranked presets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1119" target="_blank">00:18:39.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So these are presets that are personalized, searchable, and even invoked through natural language.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1124" target="_blank">00:18:44.920</a></span> | <span class="t">They might not even be directly visible to the user.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1128" target="_blank">00:18:48.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So the user types in something like more friendly, and you pull up the corresponding presets, like kindness, how close you are, how confrontational it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1137" target="_blank">00:18:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Again, maybe they're directly editing it, maybe they're not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And this gets to the last point, or second to last point, which is developer-defined personalization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So as soon as you're able to define those sort of features, you can start tuning them per user.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1153" target="_blank">00:19:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So each user, in a way that you can't do with just text prompts today, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1158" target="_blank">00:19:18.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Because text prompts are sort of this fragile house of cards, where if you remove one word, the whole output changes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1165" target="_blank">00:19:25.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're able to tune it per user.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1169" target="_blank">00:19:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And the last point, and especially true, as you start, your app is going to become increasingly different per user, is shifting from evals to analytics.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1181" target="_blank">00:19:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think there's going to be some objectively correct, for a lot of domains, answer to things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1186" target="_blank">00:19:46.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, who was the first president, yes, but the right sort of tone for a summary for a specific user, I don't think so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1195" target="_blank">00:19:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think that increasingly, it's going to be about how do you understand if you're meeting the needs of your users, and what they're asking for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1205" target="_blank">00:20:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's it. Thank you so much. Oh yeah, we'll skip this one. And thank you so much for coming.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nOLb27hQ5w&t=1212" target="_blank">00:20:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">*outro music*</span></div></div></body></html>
