Let's specifically take the form of NFT that everybody likes to criticize. That's just digital art. Right. And so every criticism people make of that is the same criticism you would make a buying and selling paintings. It would be the same buying and selling photographs.</p><p>What's the Mona Lisa worth? So one way of looking at the Mona Lisa is that it's worth the cost of producing it, right? It's, it's worth the canvas and the paint. Or you could say the Mona Lisa is like a cultural artifact. And as a cultural artifact, it's worth, you know, probably a billion dollars or $10 billion.</p><p>Like what explains the spread between $25 and like the $10 billion? Because people care, right? Because it's art, because it's aesthetic, because it's cultural. It's part of what we've decided is, is the cultural heritage of humanity. The thing that makes like life worth living is that it's not just about like subsistence.</p></div></div></body></html>
