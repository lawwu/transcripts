And Oppenheimer said, "No." The interrogator said, "Why is that?" He said, "Because the target was too small." So, after the war, when our bomb planners went into Hiroshima and Nagasaki, those two cities didn't look that different from the other cities that had been firebombed with ordinary high explosives.</p><p>They went home with the thought that, "Ah, these bombs are not so destructive after all." They had been touted as city busters, and they weren't. They were not certainly more destructive than the firebombing campaign, when everything of more than 50,000 population had already been destroyed. That, in turn, influenced the judgment about what we needed to do vis-a-vis the Soviet Union.</p></div></div></body></html>
