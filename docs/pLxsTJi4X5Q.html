Again, I wrote a whole book about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me just give you two quick heuristics. One, remember that the real productivity poison when it comes to email is messages that arrive at unscheduled times and will require your response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.440</a></span> | <span class="t">When figuring out the basic processes you use to execute your work, that is what you want to minimize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Not complexity, not time required to get something done. Number of unscheduled messages that require a response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=164" target="_blank">00:02:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">That is what you want to reduce. That is what creates stress in your inbox.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=168" target="_blank">00:02:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Knowing that at any moment, messages could be arriving that require a response sooner being better than later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.240</a></span> | <span class="t">As long as that is largely the reality of how you interact with your inbox, you will have to be in there all the time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">which is very distracting, or trying to batch and be really stressed about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Second heuristic I will briefly mention for taming your inbox is remembering that email is best for delivering information, contracts, files, announcements, or non-urgent questions that can be answered with one reply.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">So if I need to know, can you remind me again when your trip to Georgia is? That is a great use of email. I can send it to you. It is not stressful when you see that message. You can answer it whenever. It is not urgent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is a much better way for me to get that information than to interrupt you or to stop by your office.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Anything beyond that, and in particular, back and forth conversation, anything that requires back and forth conversation, find another place to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And don't just say Slack because that creates the same problem of I have to keep monitoring Slack to do these back and forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=237" target="_blank">00:03:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Office hours, like we talked about in episode two of nine, docket clearing meetings with your team, informal conversation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I grab you in the hallway when I see you passing by. Hey, quick question, could we figure this out? Or tacking things on to existing meetings.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Hey, as long as we're here talking about whatever, let's handle X, Y, and Z real fast as well. Do not use email for back and forth conversation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me just give a quick vent here. I've had this happen twice in the last week. And really, this captures my frustration with email, encapsulates it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Twice in the past week, this has happened. Someone will send an email to me and a couple other people, usually like a scheduling type of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, hey, when are we going to get together on this? And they'll send this email like in the one case at four o'clock.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't see it because I didn't happen to check email after four o'clock. And I made the next day I finally get the checking email after I write and it's noon.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And they have a bunch of back and forth discussion that's ended with like having to call me out specifically. So Cal, what is your answer here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">As if like something weird happened, like I must have somehow missed or ignored their thread, because I didn't answer it at 430 or at 9am the next morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.280</a></span> | <span class="t">And whenever I encountered that, and that's happened to me twice. One of them was 4pm the message was sent and by like 10am the next morning, they were repeating it for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Cal, what's your answer here? What's going on? The other one was on a Saturday. And by Sunday, this person was saying, Cal, what's going on? What's your answer here?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=330" target="_blank">00:05:30.240</a></span> | <span class="t">When I see that, I say, OK, this is someone who is completely captured in the hyperactive hive mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Your entire work is just doing these back and forth ongoing conversations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And if that's the way you do all of your work, you're dependent on everyone else to do the same thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLxsTJi4X5Q&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I refuse to do it.
