Right.</p><p>So it's, it's almost a goal into just having more births from the average American, like if the average American just had more kids, the population would still grow and the relative effect of the brightest people might dilute a little bit. Um, but, and that, maybe that's a huge tragedy.</p><p>We don't know without a bunch of extra math and a bunch of weird assumptions. We don't know. So like, I, there's a point at which I have to say, like, I don't know. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Is diluting the power of the smartest person in America, like keeping us from having wondrous miracles all around us all the time?</p><p>I mean, probably not, but I don't know.</p></div></div></body></html>
