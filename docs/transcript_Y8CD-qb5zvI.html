So flexibility is key. One really interesting example here was I was talking with a member who was very successful very early in his career. So at age 24, had a huge exit, a ton of money. And he said, I want to really get this right.</p><p>This is a life changing sum of money. But so he ended up buying 80,000 acres of farmland and putting it into this farmland trust. And I was talking to him now, he's like, okay, I did that at 24. So now, you know, 20 years later, I've got a four year old kid, you know, the first person to take money out of that is his kid.</p><p>So you know, we're looking at another, you know, 25 years before even a beneficiary. So he says, you know, I'm growing, you know, coffee in Hawaii, I'm growing oranges in Florida, I've got corn in Iowa, but I'm still driving my Camry because I can't touch that money. So this idea of saying, hey, you know, there's a mathematically right answer and a tax code, optimally efficient answer.</p><p>And I asked if we could share this anecdote. He said, Yeah, I want everybody to be aware of sort of how this stuff works. But thinking about the flexibility of, you know, giving yourself some options in case you want to go a different direction in the future.</p></div></div></body></html>
