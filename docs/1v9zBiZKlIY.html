interrupting me and being interrupted by the agent constantly that was the worst part for sure I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=701" target="_blank">00:11:41.300</a></span> | <span class="t">don't think it was the worst part for me I understand how did you overcome that challenge during the demo</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=708" target="_blank">00:11:48.300</a></span> | <span class="t">well hopefully we're going to overcome the challenge by using the new

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=727" target="_blank">00:12:07.700</a></span> | <span class="t">demo absolutely can you share your experience with building a demo yeah definitely so I needed to build a demo but I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=740" target="_blank">00:12:20.880</a></span> | <span class="t">wasn't I wasn't a hundred percent sure what it was that I should build and then I I was thinking like probably the best way to show that would be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.260</a></span> | <span class="t">uh would be side-by-side</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah thank you I'll I'll let no I'll let Shane know that you all applauded his demo uh he'll appreciate that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=768" target="_blank">00:12:48.440</a></span> | <span class="t">yeah you can really see it's a night and day difference when you augment the VAD with models that look at the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.940</a></span> | <span class="t">semantics and syntax and prosody um so a good segue to my next slide so there's another type of another approach</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=781" target="_blank">00:13:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">which people are taking to augmenting the VAD and what they're doing is not just taking the semantic input the text based input</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.340</a></span> | <span class="t">but they're also looking at the audio signal as well and trying to infer things from the acoustic features of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.740</a></span> | <span class="t">dialogue so they're taking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=794" target="_blank">00:13:14.300</a></span> | <span class="t">uh the basic ideas the input is audio tokens and the output is the probability that the user is finished speaking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.340</a></span> | <span class="t">um Quinn in the daily team have built their also open weight smart turn model that that uh this is this neat combination of a model that is both transformer and looking at acoustic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.400</a></span> | <span class="t">um characteristics um and then one of the new things that has just emerged has been um assembly ai dropped their their speech to text new streaming speech to text service earlier this week</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.560</a></span> | <span class="t">and their model is really neat in that it emits it takes audio in and emits out both the transcript and a likelihood that uh the speaker is finished speaking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.900</a></span> | <span class="t">um so it's one model that's kind of doing both these two things at the same time um and it's also looking at the acoustic features and the semantic features</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=843" target="_blank">00:14:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">one of the things i want qtai also has one that they recently released it's pretty neat um one of the things i want to note about this though is if you're using your speech to texts built in end of utterance model it's only seeing half the context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">it's only seeing what the user is saying it's not also seeing what the agent is saying so it doesn't quite have the full picture on the context</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">um but it works remarkably well these all these approaches work remarkably well and are a major step forward from these</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=869" target="_blank">00:14:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">more traditional vads and like definitely something that if you're building a voice ai agent after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.280</a></span> | <span class="t">this conference you should go like implement it they're pretty easy to implement on the different platforms too</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">um okay so we often talk about in uh uh speech models or in voice ai that um speech models are uh are going to save us</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">um

target="_blank">00:14:55.620</a></span> | <span class="t">um but actually if you look at how these models work that like openai's real-time api they're still using a</span></div><div class="c"><span

or not speech or you can you can opt to turn on their semantic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=911" target="_blank">00:15:11.180</a></span> | <span class="t">they call it semantic vad which is kind of a uh paradox it's not the best term but turning on semantic model that augments the

set for benchmarking that and it's just it's just really it's a tough problem um and i feel like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=1472" target="_blank">00:24:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">like the industry as a whole doesn't have a good benchmark around turn taking um and that it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

detection problem so first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9zBiZKlIY&t=1505" target="_blank">00:25:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">for a
