What is the purpose of this email is to teach them like a specific lesson or get them to take a specific action. It generally makes everything a lot more interesting. So finding the reason is the first thing that people need to do if they're gonna write about something before they ever start writing.</p><p>Okay, so do you do that anytime you're sending a memo, writing an email? Let's pretend I've gotta send an email to someone I collaborate with at work to try to get them to see my perspective on a project. So instead of just me raw dumping all my thoughts onto an email and expecting them to read it, I'm thinking about them.</p><p>If I just raw dump full page or two of my thoughts, now they have to read this. This is giving them more work. So anytime I get a long email too, someone's like, hey, can you help me with this? I'm like, you're giving me an assignment? Now I have more work because of you.</p><p>So I always think like, how can I make this person's life easier? And so I could just say, hey, Chris, I have thoughts on this. You got time in 10 minutes to talk, call my number, something like that. Something that's very easy for them or give them bullet points of what I'm thinking.</p><p>And then maybe we could discuss it further.</p></div></div></body></html>
