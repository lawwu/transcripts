You know, credit cards, I think, are the main things people think about when it comes to sign-up bonuses, but there's this whole avenue of bank bonuses, brokerage bonuses, meal kits that you can do that can really make you a lot of money, and that's for us, like, in the last couple of years, you know, I think 2023, we made $36,000 doing these profitable deals, and two and a half million points the year before was $32,000 and a million points, so it's been slowly kind of climbing up in that sense, and I think we're on track to make even more this year.</p></div></div></body></html>
