So let's see here. So let me find -- actually, the paper is not pulled up. So let me load Zotero again. This is actually the code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=11" target="_blank">00:00:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let me get rid of that. Okay. All right. Awesome. So the paper that I'm going to go over is this gene PT paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=22" target="_blank">00:00:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So basically, the concept that -- the concept is basically to use the embedding -- GPT embedding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=34" target="_blank">00:00:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So actually -- so I haven't tried it yet, but presumably you could do this with any embedding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what they do conceptually, there's a good diagram here, is that first they just take -- there's like a database of gene to description.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can give it a gene. You get back a description of that gene.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so you just put that into the embedding model. They used Ada2, but they -- you could do this with other ones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=65" target="_blank">00:01:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And in fact, they did try it with some others. And then you get back a vector.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=71" target="_blank">00:01:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then first of all, you can do certain clustering and other things just from there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But -- so there's also a technology called single cell sequencing, which means that they -- instead of -- so normally what happens is you have a cluster of --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=94" target="_blank">00:01:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you have a sample from a person or whatever animal or plant. You take that sample, and then you like sort of just -- you know, conceptually speaking, you just stick it in a blender, find all the RNA.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then that gives you a -- or DNA, depending on what you're doing. You can -- DNA or RNA, and it gives you like the expression level of the gene or the genes itself so you can get for that whole sample, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's different types of cells. If it's genes, then all the genes should be the same, unless you're looking at like certain epigenetic factors like chromatin and other things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I'm saying is that -- and I'm -- like I don't know a lot about this. I'm just talking about my very high level understanding here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or RNA, which is -- so just to brief summary, genes are sort of like a program to make RNA. RNA, there's like a -- there's like a whole machinery in the cell that takes snippets of the DNA, and it uses that to replicate RNA, which then folds into proteins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And those proteins do various things. Some of them are -- so like proteins are just these long sequences of RNA that like spontaneously fold up into various shapes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And these -- sometimes these like perform functions in the cell like, you know, building structures in the cell, or they can be, you know, sort of -- they can like sort of be -- have functions like the molecules can bind to other molecules and used for signaling,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or they can actually bind to the DNA itself and cause it to amplify or suppress the expression of a gene. So there's like this super nonlinear, highly complex, you know, sequence of things that interact with each other within the cell and then also these proteins</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=227" target="_blank">00:03:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">can be like sort of end up on the surface of the cell and then other -- when cells bump against it, or, you know, other things bump against it, then they can, you know, you're signaling to those other things. So like that's -- okay, that's RJ's very, very poorly done genetics 101.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, anyway, you have these cells.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=248" target="_blank">00:04:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a technology now that has become common in the last couple years, in which you can take each individual cell and look at the expression level of genes in that individual cell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=262" target="_blank">00:04:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you know, sort of you can imagine just like kind of like separating out the cells and then, you know, sort of like, you know, sticking each cell individually in a blender and looking at counting the, you know, sort of instance of RNA sequences in genes in that RNA expression of genes in that individual cell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's what -- so what we're looking at here -- so first of all, does anyone want to ask a question? That was really, you know, spontaneously bad explanation, but if anyone wants to understand that better, I'd be happy to do my best.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=304" target="_blank">00:05:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Okay, good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll just -- my quick feedback is A is a lot more intuitive than B. B looks like gene attention.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so, okay, so here, let me, let me go over this diagram then. So what happens is you take one of these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you have a, you have a cell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then that cell, it's gone through a set of cells, N cells, and they've gone through this sequencing thing so that each -- so you have a, a expression level for each gene for each cell, right, so that's what this matrix is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So then, and then what you do is you take the embeddings from each of -- from, from GPT or wherever, in this case GPT, and you just weight them by the expression level in that particular cell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=359" target="_blank">00:05:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right, so, so like I have all these genes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=363" target="_blank">00:06:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">These are my embeddings for each gene so like each, each row is a gene.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I just weight that for each cell by that gene, and then I sum them up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So now I have a -- for each cell I have like a single embedding that corresponds to that cell, which is just the weighted sum of all of the embeddings for each gene weighted by the expression level.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that make sense? That's the core concept here so I want to make sure that came across clearly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And then there's a second.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=404" target="_blank">00:06:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a second mechanism that they also tried so C is just another way of doing this, where they just even simpler, they just take the, they, they look at the thousand highest expressed genes, and then they just put their name into a, into a string.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=424" target="_blank">00:07:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, it starts with like cell one or in reality it's like a slightly longer prompt. And it just says, like, here's the, you know, here's like all the thousand most expressed genes in this cell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=439" target="_blank">00:07:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they stick each one of those into the embedding model and out comes a, you know, sort of n embedding embeddings. Yeah, n embeddings for all those cells.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=453" target="_blank">00:07:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That cleared the mechanism. So this is like really, really, really simple in the sense that the high level mechanisms very straightforward. Of course there is the really complex transformer underneath that is doing all the textual embedding, which is, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=471" target="_blank">00:07:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but something that we most well many, many people in the paper club should understand pretty well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, good. So, so then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=482" target="_blank">00:08:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So then, like, skipping over the related work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, they, so basically, without going into too much detail they, I think that I've, you know, been pretty clear about what they do, they have like these 30,000 genes they do a bunch of duplication.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is because what I mean a big part of this, getting this to work is actually just figuring out how to, like, all the different papers have different names for genes and there's, there's sort of like a whole bunch of databases and they all use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">slightly different, you know, sort of stuff so there is this one ensemble database which is this right here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=526" target="_blank">00:08:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And this ensemble database actually is like has a, the goal of it is to take all the different names for a gene and just give it one ID. And so they use this to sort of unify everything.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=542" target="_blank">00:09:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then. Okay, so then they have some different applications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=548" target="_blank">00:09:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They have this, you know, sort of like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=552" target="_blank">00:09:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Functionality class prediction, meaning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So like what is the impact of what is the function of this cell.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And sort of like gene gene interaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sort of like other unsupervised stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then like, like looking at different cell states and so they have data sets that are labeled or partly labeled for all these things so they can just use the embedding to test for, like, you test its accuracy and all these different things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so then, and then they have this, the results here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you look at, you know, so you have this confusion. Oh, okay yeah this confusion matrix. And you can see it you know like it kind of gets a lot of stuff right it looks like this protein coding one, which I think is one of the main things that you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">actually care about for RNA expression is, you know, sort of has a lot of errors and then this, or sorry, like it thinks that a lot of things are protein coding, when they're not, and it's processing that I don't know what this process transcript</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">means but like that one goes, gets along wrong a lot.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, so like these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=635" target="_blank">00:10:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oops. So like you can see that like, it seems to beat the competition pretty well this gene former is, is a model that you know that's a little bit older and then this scgpt has gotten a lot of, a lot of attention recently it's a.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=654" target="_blank">00:10:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like a BERT, so similar to a BERT model, or no sorry this one gene former is a BERT model GPT is like a GPT model, and they, and they, you know, do pretty good at, at, you know, sort of they beat these models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've actually used their, I'll show you guys, because we probably will run out of time. I have, I've gone through the notebooks that the authors provide which were pretty good they're a little old so they were broken but I kind of fix them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=683" target="_blank">00:11:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, but, and this was actually the.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This was similar to the result I got. So these results do seem pretty valid.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But like so maybe some of these other things are harder protein protein interaction, you know so your ROC curve is like, not so great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So a lot of these other ones are, you know, there be, but in any event they're winning. Right, so like I, this is to me I think this is like the headline is it's just pretty incredible that you have these specialized models that were designed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">specifically to code for, you know, genetic, the relationship between genetic information, and that, like, instead we just take text that is a description of the gene that, you know, sort of briefly summarizes our knowledge about that gene, and then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">turn it into embedding and it does dramatic pretty dramatically better than these specialized models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=745" target="_blank">00:12:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, I mean, I think if you think about it's not super surprising because, you know, like the language has so much nuance nuanced information in it that if you use a good model then you might be able to capture all that nuance better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=762" target="_blank">00:12:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, but, you know, like, in any event, like it's pretty incredible how much how well they beat them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so this was like, so I didn't go through this part, really, in detail but like they basically were trying to prove okay yeah we're actually capturing underlying biology well there, you know, this sort of have these clusters of genes that make sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=787" target="_blank">00:13:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I think has a question. Yeah. Okay. Sorry to interrupt. One question. So, could you like, I didn't know you had a chance to look at this but like how, how, how exactly are they going from the vector representation of a gene to a protein</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=803" target="_blank">00:13:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">protein interaction prediction, how does that exactly how do you go from, from that to predicting an interaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=811" target="_blank">00:13:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let me actually, that's a good segue here, I will I think that is this one. So if you look, so let's see protein.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, you asked about protein protein or gene gene.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=828" target="_blank">00:13:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, honestly, I either of them whichever is simpler I guess we can start with. Yeah, so this one is the gene gene interaction. So they have these.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=838" target="_blank">00:13:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So let's see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=842" target="_blank">00:14:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Where's the meat of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=847" target="_blank">00:14:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so okay right what they do is they just, they create a embedding of the two. They take the two gene embeddings, and they, and they sum them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So they've now you have like these two genes that you have two genes you sum them together. And then you use that so let's see what do they do here, they,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they fit. In this case logistic regression I, I actually tried also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">light GBM and it doesn't make a huge difference but it's a lot faster. It does slightly beat the, the logistic regression but it doesn't matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=898" target="_blank">00:14:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let's see, they, they sum the two genes together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So here like row of label is just like zero or one, I imagine like for whether it's.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=909" target="_blank">00:15:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's right. That's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, does that make sense. Yeah, so yeah you're trading in logistic regression against the sum of the two genes. Yeah, I'm trying to predict like yeah whether they interact or not, whether Yeah, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=924" target="_blank">00:15:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right. Yes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=925" target="_blank">00:15:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Is that clear.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=927" target="_blank">00:15:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I think that answers my question. Thank you. Okay, awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so it's actually, I was surprised that actually brings brings up a good point of how useful embeddings actually are right like I wouldn't have.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I had the same question in my mind is like, so it's like it's kind of obvious how to cluster genes and whatever whatever, but I wouldn't have thought to do what they did to predict the gene gene interaction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=955" target="_blank">00:15:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it seems like there are lots of uses of these embeddings, like there's been a lot, a lot of work, I think previously using much less capable embeddings to do these kinds of analysis so I think this is like sort of standard hat for bioinformatics</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=974" target="_blank">00:16:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and then you just throw a much better embedding model and you get much better results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=978" target="_blank">00:16:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, um, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=980" target="_blank">00:16:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They actually go. Yeah, sorry I think what's really interesting here is that like normally when people have tried to do this in the past they like they try to assume like like this like ground up approach, where they either use the sequence itself or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=992" target="_blank">00:16:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like some gene expression protein expression something, and they try to like sort of predict these interactions using that. Yeah, again, like very surprising that like, like just using text from the internet, or like text from any like standard description</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1005" target="_blank">00:16:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you can get like even like similar, like, and in this case it's like you're saying it's better right like it's very surprising that you can get like better results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1012" target="_blank">00:16:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, like yeah one thing that might be happening I guess is that it's possible that a lot of like that a lot of those descriptions itself contain information about what the, what other genes interact with the gene.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1026" target="_blank">00:17:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So, yeah, I guess that could be a confounding factor but yeah like across like millions of or I don't know I don't know what their what their set what the size of the data set was but like across even like 10s of thousands of examples, it would.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1038" target="_blank">00:17:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's really it's, it's a really cool approach, I think. Yeah. So I mean, I think you're exactly right there is like information in those descriptions I've looked at some of them about the, the like the interactions and like so it'll say like this is, you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">know, express commonly in cancer or whatever. Right. So it says, there's like so a lot of semantic content in those descriptions. And so that like, it's not surprising.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1064" target="_blank">00:17:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">After, like, in retrospect, after they've kind of tried it, it's not surprising to me that it works it's just kind of like it's pretty amazing how, like, how you like that it works so well to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1077" target="_blank">00:17:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the other thing that this brings up is it. Okay, but what else can we stick in the description right like you could you, I think they have left a lot on the table here on like okay, what if we start to put more complex descriptions that talk</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1093" target="_blank">00:18:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">about, like more explicitly about gene interactions and like there's, if you go to, like, if you go to the watch my caught the human genome browser and other things there's like all this rich rich information about every, you know, every gene in the genome</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1113" target="_blank">00:18:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that we know about. And so that like what what other information can you add to these descriptions to create like a really nice embedding that has like multiple purposes and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, um, so let's see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1129" target="_blank">00:18:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think they did. So, like, um, they did do some, they like tried, they say llama seven be. I don't know what they did for the, this is not an embedding model obviously I don't, unless they use some llama seven be embedding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1146" target="_blank">00:19:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They presumably are just using the class token as the for the embedding, I don't know that it's because it hasn't been trained on contrastive text I'm not, it's not clear to me that that's actually a great comparison.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1162" target="_blank">00:19:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, maybe some of that like something from the open MTB whatever that is a massive text embedding leaderboard. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Something from there might do better so I was going to try actually try that and see how it did. But interestingly, so while we're here I actually did try.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1183" target="_blank">00:19:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I so like if you look here at this aorta data one. I actually tried.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1191" target="_blank">00:19:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Where is it here. Yeah, so I tried this also the embedding three small which is supposed to be a replacement for Ada, and, you know, is pretty dramatically cheaper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1203" target="_blank">00:20:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But if you look at the, the results.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1219" target="_blank">00:20:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think, presumably, this was a distillation or something and they lost probably gene and from like scientific literature or gene codings or I don't know what they lost in this but it, this, this model does way worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1236" target="_blank">00:20:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I found that to be quite interesting too and so I definitely think that I'm going to spend some time and go through a bunch of models and just try the same try to do the same metrics on a whole bunch of models and see what we can see about that because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they didn't really, I don't think they did a great job in the paper of exploring embedding models are different embedding models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Not to criticize the paper it's awesome paper but that that thing came short.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1268" target="_blank">00:21:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, um, yeah so so then there's like actually this is what I'm reproducing this line here is what I'm reproducing right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1278" target="_blank">00:21:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they have, you know, this like SCGPT model. And then this is the two weighted and sentence versions of the thing and you can see mostly like this either SCGPT or this weighted model wins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It occasionally looks like for aorta actually, which it like everything does kind of poorly on for phenotype that this sentence wins for some reason, but not by a ton so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so is there, let me see if there's anything else interesting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There was a few, there's maybe one other table that I wanted to discuss briefly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1330" target="_blank">00:22:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Where is it in the bottom here I think.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1334" target="_blank">00:22:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, here, this table here. So, I found it. Another thing that they tried was this ensemble of the three SCGPT plus the, the WNS model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1348" target="_blank">00:22:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, sometimes it looks like the ensemble doesn't hardly ever win, like it wins these two but but or no I guess it wins three out of six so that's fine, but, um, but it looks like, even when it loses it's, it tends to be close to the max right so that's not surprising</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1370" target="_blank">00:22:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for an ensemble model.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1373" target="_blank">00:22:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like the losing like it last year but so it does seem like maybe it's worth doing an ensemble of different models and that the point that they make was in here is that like, it seems like SCGPT is giving you like a slightly different.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1391" target="_blank">00:23:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, it's like complimentary, the result is complimentary here. So I thought that's, that's basically all I did they have some cool visualizations that are you maps, but that's that's basically all I all I really looked at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1406" target="_blank">00:23:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe I can stop here I can go over my notebooks too but they're pretty straightforward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1412" target="_blank">00:23:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So does anyone want to comment ask question something we're like half hour and so plenty of time to talk or we can try, we can go over something else entirely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1427" target="_blank">00:23:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, we'll just one question on this like, can we, apart from annotating can we like generate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1438" target="_blank">00:23:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean it's embedding so no.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1442" target="_blank">00:24:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But, but I feel that maybe. So I've been talking about this with my buddy that I mentioned the beginning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1452" target="_blank">00:24:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The, like, I think that there's a lot of opportunity here. So,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or like there's for most papers, you know, the great thing about medical research biomedical research is oftentimes that they publish the data from, especially if it comes from an academic lab you have a paper, and you have a really nice unique data set.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1478" target="_blank">00:24:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right, so there's I think there's a, and I know that there are models that do this to some extent, where you like train on both the, you know, sort of the gene or sequence level data and the, and the text of the model and then so that maybe like you get a model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1497" target="_blank">00:24:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">for which you can put in a cell and get a description back or something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or the reverse, maybe you put in description and get out like a genome that matches that, or like a gene level expression information or sequence that kind of models what you what you think it should.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1519" target="_blank">00:25:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think those are like, I think those are something that we hope to work up to. And I know that there, there's already a lot of work being put into Eric Schmidt thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1531" target="_blank">00:25:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think I suspect, probably those guys are probably doing a lot of that. So, I think our focus is like sort of build up these like basic capabilities and then put it yeah eventually to be able to generate your like either gene level or for for training</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">kinds of things or sequence level for maybe even designing like designing genes for for like specific purposes, according to like whatever the scientific literature says you should do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1567" target="_blank">00:26:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So yeah, definitely not from this, I don't think but but I think it's possible. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1574" target="_blank">00:26:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1576" target="_blank">00:26:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And the other, the other really interesting thing that and this will be the next thing that we try that I should mention is that this is actually be right now it's trained.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1587" target="_blank">00:26:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This technique actually probably we have to test this but there's like an order of magnitude more data on bulk what's called bulk data where you like I said in the beginning you kind of like you have a sample that's you know reasonably large piece of tissue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1604" target="_blank">00:26:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">that has lots and lots of different types of cells, and you get the gene level expression data on those that whole sample all mixed up together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1616" target="_blank">00:26:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that there's actually an opportunity here to apply exactly the same technique to that and use it for like the classification of that sample like say did like what were the changes either classification or other things where like what was the change</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1632" target="_blank">00:27:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">in gene expression between when I applied gave this drug, or like diet for diagnosis like is, is this cell like exhibit this or this sample exhibit this gene, or this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1647" target="_blank">00:27:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sorry, exhibit a disease because you know the RNA is being expressed to counteract the disease or whatever. So like, so there's like a really cool opportunity that, which is what we're probably going to start working on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1661" target="_blank">00:27:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, like later this week or something or next week. And so, you know, maybe in the watch my caught the AI in action.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1671" target="_blank">00:27:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll try to, if we have some cool results and I'll, I'll try to, you know, sort of do an AI in action on it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1679" target="_blank">00:27:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Awesome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1681" target="_blank">00:28:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Cool.

I was actually literally just adding Modern BERT to the AI engineering reading list like right, right, right before this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1745" target="_blank">00:29:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would love to honestly just get hands on with it like, yeah, it seems like a good paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1754" target="_blank">00:29:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What do you like about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1758" target="_blank">00:29:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh Sebastian says, cooperation among LLM agents.

We don't have to do it today, we can do it next week. But yeah, I mean, I guess, I guess, I'd be down for a Modern BERT slash LLM agent cooperation thing next week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1809" target="_blank">00:30:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I was kind of, I don't think I was too interested in like going over cultural evolution or cooperation. I just wanted to like have, like if we don't have anything else to cover, I'll just go, I'll just run through it quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1823" target="_blank">00:30:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Sure. Yeah, I mean nothing for today I was going to end it early, but if you if you like I'm still trying to understand this donor game that's on the, on the, on the paper, but if you already have it in your head and yeah, by all means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1835" target="_blank">00:30:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I can go through it. So, I mean, so, this is related to a paper I've been talking about recently with multi agent steganography, where they're hiding messages, it's a kind of game, but more sort of safety oriented.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1859" target="_blank">00:30:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You got it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1861" target="_blank">00:31:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

Okay, I'll share my screen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1883" target="_blank">00:31:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1887" target="_blank">00:31:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I also have a Jupyter notebook but I'm not going to open, open that up instead I'm just going to open up the GitHub repo for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1896" target="_blank">00:31:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I own GitHub repo I don't think they actually published a GitHub repo, but okay. So, in general, like to set the base of this paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1906" target="_blank">00:31:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They're trying to explore, like, how agents are in the hypothetical scenario that you're building an organization that consists of multiple agents interacting with each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1917" target="_blank">00:31:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they want these agents to pursue, like the collective interest of all the agents put together, instead of a single agent, just looking out for itself and trying to maximize rewards for itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1930" target="_blank">00:32:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they posit that by, by having, by having the positive that, like the game of the donors game is a representation of, like, collective benefit of an organization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1947" target="_blank">00:32:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so what the donors game is is a game that is covered in game theory, which suggests.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1956" target="_blank">00:32:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Just kind of draw it out. So you have, like, three players, you have a player one, you have player two, you have player three, and there's three, there is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1965" target="_blank">00:32:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea is that if the whole of the three players will benefit from donations between each of the agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1976" target="_blank">00:32:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, one donated three, three donated two, back and forth, and then over the course of, like, at the limit of, like, X amount of donations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1985" target="_blank">00:33:05.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If, if there was a lot of donations between the different agents, one will end up with more, like, sum of money than had none of them donated in the first place.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=1998" target="_blank">00:33:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And a key, a key principle of this is that it has to be a positive sum game, meaning that there is an increase in, like, the total pool of wealth/resources in the collective, in the organization.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2017" target="_blank">00:33:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what they do in the paper is that whenever one donates to three, let's say one donates a two quantity of something, then that gets multiplied by two when three receives it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2031" target="_blank">00:33:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, three ends up receiving four, even though one only lost two. So, this is just a representation of positive sum.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2038" target="_blank">00:33:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, if you just continue cycling this over and over and over again, assuming that everybody's, like, completely, everybody, everybody just continues to donate to each other and nobody just hoards the information and decides to, decides to just keep the money,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2057" target="_blank">00:34:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">then you eventually have, like, three with, assuming that ten start, one starts with ten, everybody, assuming that everybody starts with ten, he loses, he loses two, which leads to, which leads to three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2073" target="_blank">00:34:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, he goes from ten, three goes from ten to fourteen, and then three donates also two to the second agent, and then two gets fourteen, two goes from ten to fourteen, and then two donates two back to ten,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2093" target="_blank">00:34:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">reciprocating the, reciprocating the original, the original donation, resulting in ten, which went, which went from ten to eight, going to basically twelve, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2104" target="_blank">00:35:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that's the idea behind the donor's game. Like, if everybody donates in this system, then every single player is going to result in having a greater sum than if they just didn't donate at all.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2115" target="_blank">00:35:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, that is what they're basically trying to illustrate with agents and trying to see, like, which, they explore which models are, perform best in this, in this, in this game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2129" target="_blank">00:35:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And they end up finding, I think, that, and here's, here's a design, but just to not get sidetracked, they point out that, okay, here's the, here's the results of the models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2145" target="_blank">00:35:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Cloud 3.5 Sawnit performs the best, and something that was interesting is that GPT 4.0 didn't perform very well, and as far, as far as what I gathered from the paper is that GPT 4.0 was, like, too, too careful with its donations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2162" target="_blank">00:36:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, GPT 4.0 was, would refuse to donate, was, like, too skeptical of donating whenever it would, it would be his turn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2172" target="_blank">00:36:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, yeah, he just wouldn't donate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2177" target="_blank">00:36:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Cloud 3.5 Sawnit understood the premise of the game, and so just was more liberal with donations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2184" target="_blank">00:36:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, again, something I didn't point out is that if, for example, 3 just decides to keep all the money, then this game completely just falls apart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2194" target="_blank">00:36:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">1, at the worst case, will just end up losing money, and then 2 won't get anything, and then maybe 2 donates to 1, and so the, the, the ultimate, like, loser is going to be 2.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2206" target="_blank">00:36:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that, that's what you got to take into account.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2209" target="_blank">00:36:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, 1 is that it's a positive sum, 2 that you can actually see the reputation of the players. So, you can see, for example, if 3 donated to 2, or if 3 decided not to donate to 2, and based off that information, you inform whether or not you should actually carry on donating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2224" target="_blank">00:37:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, that is the idea of the paper, and I didn't prepare to present this, but I just want to have kind of your, the crowd's take on whether you guys think this is, like, an accurate, a good benchmark to judge models on for, for basically organization, organization-wide agent clusters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2251" target="_blank">00:37:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, just, any thoughts on that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2255" target="_blank">00:37:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Any thoughts on the, the whole thing?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2259" target="_blank">00:37:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Donor's game as a benchmark, basically, for, couple of questions. Donor's game as a benchmark for, like, agent, agent organizations, and 2 is, what is 2? Oh, yeah, agent organizations in general.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2278" target="_blank">00:37:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I like it. I want to, I want to let other people respond before I jump in, but anyone, anyone have takes on this? It's a nice paper. I never, I can't believe I haven't heard of it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2294" target="_blank">00:38:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, yeah. I would like to see some, like, more models. I think the whole, like, PVP, 333 thing has been tried in crypto. I've seen it, like, play out, and I think more often than not, it ends up with, like, the whole, like, somebody, it's like a game of chicken, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2312" target="_blank">00:38:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, whoever pulls out first, keeps the money first, like, wins, essentially. But, but it's super interesting to me, but I would, it would be cool to see other, like, maybe some of the open source models or, like, see how, how it plays out, because I, I do think, as people, like, bring more agents online, or as agents become useful, this would be, like, an important thing to, like, figure out how to, how to incentivize them all to, you know, play nice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2337" target="_blank">00:38:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, you mentioned the game of chicken, and they did kind of address that towards the, they tried to prevent people from gaming, prevent the agents from gaming the system. Somewhere in the paper, they discuss how they actually don't disclose when the round is going to end, because ideally, if you know when the round is going to end, you just wait till that round and just, like, keep everything. So that's an interesting, interesting, just, policy that they added.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2366" target="_blank">00:39:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, yeah, and here are some, some, here are some of the results. I forgot to cover this, but some of the results of, like, me running, me running this locally on GVD4, and total money per round. This is basically just one of the metrics that they were using to, to evaluate, determine the effectiveness of the paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2385" target="_blank">00:39:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, the effective, collaboration. Basically, this is, like, the overarching metric behind it. Like, if, the more, the more the organization donated, the more the, the virtual cycle would take over. And you can kind of see a trend where the generation one, oh, and another thing is that over the course of, so, so the idea is you start with, like, a set of, you start with a set of agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2414" target="_blank">00:40:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not sure if I'm sharing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2417" target="_blank">00:40:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, we can see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2420" target="_blank">00:40:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so over the course of, you start with, they started with 12 agents, and what would happen is, like, you would run a donor's game, a donor's game iteration, and then towards the end of the donor's game iteration, you would have the top six, the top half, be able to descend, they're basically going to be the parents for the, for the next generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2446" target="_blank">00:40:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're going to give the, the, the original strategies of the top six performing onto the next generation, and so on and so forth. And so that's what these different Gs represent in the legend. And so you can see some, like, upwards trend in, like, accumulated money. Then I did, like, average donation percentage.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2468" target="_blank">00:41:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Were there, were the, was this, like, an evolutionary algorithm? Meaning, like, you combine, so, so, like, when you, the next generation is some sort of combination of the strategies of the previous generation?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2482" target="_blank">00:41:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, exactly. That's what it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2484" target="_blank">00:41:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2485" target="_blank">00:41:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can actually see the prompts. I love what they did with the, the way they illustrated the prompts, it was very clear. So in the, where's the evolution prompt? Okay, so a system prompt, that one's passed. This one just, like, describes the game. Donation prompt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2506" target="_blank">00:41:46.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This just determines how you should donate. And it also includes, like, the trace, the reputation trace of who you're donating to. And this was also something that was interesting, how they did the donation trace. And then the strategy prompt. Yeah, okay, so this is, this is basically what you're looking at for generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2524" target="_blank">00:42:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If the, if it's a first generation, it just generates some strategy. If it is any subsequent generation, it is going to, it is going to just inherit the top strategies of the previous game. So, as described here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2543" target="_blank">00:42:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so it's, it's basically, that's really cool that's using the LLM to kind of merge this or like sort of combined strategies from the previous generation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2553" target="_blank">00:42:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Nice. Yeah. And I think I'm thinking of expanding this to like be more direct, like a lineage where the top, the top donator is going to have like three children, the second top donator has two children, the third top donator has one children, just like replicates.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2572" target="_blank">00:42:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What is it called? Natural selection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2579" target="_blank">00:42:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, I don't really understand, like, what is the, so I was just poking around online that I don't understand the difference between the donation game and prisoners dilemma except that I read that the donation game is a version in which you have a growing, it's a positive some, which is what you said as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2600" target="_blank">00:43:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, why does that matter. Like, what's the distinction here between prisoners dilemma and the donation game. Remind me what the prisoners dilemma is about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2610" target="_blank">00:43:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2624" target="_blank">00:43:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's like, oh, well, you know, you know, like, if you don't, if you don't sell the other guy out, then, you know, you're gonna, he's going to sell you out and you're going to go, you're going to go to jail for like five years, but if you, you know, and if you sell,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2640" target="_blank">00:44:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">if you each sell each other out. Then, you know, each of you gets three if, if you sell the other person out and they don't sell you out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2651" target="_blank">00:44:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if neither sells each other out and you only get one right so like there's been a lot it's been probably the most studied game. And if you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2661" target="_blank">00:44:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and so there's like this iterated prisoners drama which is like this, where you go over, if you play over and over again for an infinite amount of time then there are strategies for which you can induce cooperation by the other by your opponent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2679" target="_blank">00:44:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, and so, um, so like yeah super, super well studied game. And this is I think related game, but I guess you don't since you don't understand, you might have trouble distinguishing the two since you haven't encountered it before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2696" target="_blank">00:44:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it, I think, I think they both, they both represent like a similar dynamic where you want to, you want what's beneficial for like you to like as the sum of all parties involved, rather than the reward for a single one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2715" target="_blank">00:45:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm actually, you could, you could potentially do the same thing for prisoners dilemma I just don't know how, how the information transfers between prisoners between the prisoners game.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2732" target="_blank">00:45:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I think that the setup, it sounds to me like the setup is the same it's just that you have a growing like you have this positive some game right so that that's in that that changes that dynamics but I don't understand how so I.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2745" target="_blank">00:45:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, yeah. Anyway, um, maybe I'll, I'll look into that and put it in the chat later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2751" target="_blank">00:45:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2756" target="_blank">00:45:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, I'm just gonna go through the rest. I don't think this graphic was actually very interesting. Oh, what happened here is on the third generation, some of the LLMs, and instance, and agent, and bear in mind this is a.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2771" target="_blank">00:46:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What was this for, like, the run that I did was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2778" target="_blank">00:46:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's four generations, six rounds for each generation and four players, and one of the players on the reason you see like a big spike here is that one of the players here decided to just donate more than all of his money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2795" target="_blank">00:46:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I basically told them to do like a percentage between zero and one, and they just decided to do 1.3.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2803" target="_blank">00:46:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I just donated everything, which led to a massive spike in like the overall game pool here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awxxnT_5bBE&t=2813" target="_blank">00:46:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then, LLMs are terrible at numbers.
