The schedule I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NVY14hjY7M&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">try to keep is writing first thing every morning, five to six days a week.

Two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NVY14hjY7M&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">things happened. One, an unexpected commitment fell onto my plate in this case. The New Yorker</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NVY14hjY7M&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.920</a></span> | <span class="t">asked me to write a reaction piece to something that was timely. So in my two-shift system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NVY14hjY7M&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">where in the morning I work on my primary DeepWork, and in the afternoon I do a short shift</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NVY14hjY7M&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.680</a></span> | <span class="t">on my secondary DeepWork, I had to swap and make this New Yorker article the thing I was working on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NVY14hjY7M&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">during my primary DeepWork hours.

Next, calendar creep. So as much as I try to defend the morning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NVY14hjY7M&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">for when I work on my book, inevitably there will be days where things come in that take up that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NVY14hjY7M&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">time. And I've had multiple things recently come right near each other in my schedule. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NVY14hjY7M&t=170" target="_blank">00:02:50.320</a></span> | <span class="t">actually been a little bit frustrating. It's just coincidence. But they've come into my schedule,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NVY14hjY7M&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">they've been hard to avoid, but they've made progress on the book difficult. So I'm looking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NVY14hjY7M&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.640</a></span> | <span class="t">at my calendar here, I'm going to give you two real world examples of calendar creep,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NVY14hjY7M&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">places where my attempts to protect my morning failed.

I don't get</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NVY14hjY7M&t=232" target="_blank">00:03:52.240</a></span> | <span class="t">back from dropping my kids off from school until 830 or 845.

I've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NVY14hjY7M&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">added a Saturday writing block for this weekend.
