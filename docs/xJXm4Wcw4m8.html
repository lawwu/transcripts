So how do we do it? There's an old, I believe it was a British expression.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Any Brits in the room other than me?

And the idea with that expression is if you want to know how a thief works, you set a thief to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.100</a></span> | <span class="t">The thief understands the thief, so knows how to catch it. And we can kind of apply that logic to AI.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=244" target="_blank">00:04:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">We can set an AI to verify an AI. We can actually ask a non-determinant system like an AI to evaluate an AI for us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And it turns out, AI's are not bad at this. They're about as good as a human is at determining whether an AI actually worked.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.300</a></span> | <span class="t">And that opens up this whole new world of things we can do in that we can use AI to evaluate, is our AI application actually working?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=269" target="_blank">00:04:29.060</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've got a demo here. I'm not going to do this demo live because conference Wi-Fi? Have you all had fun with Wi-Fi?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. The gentleman in the back there very kindly managed to get me connected to an actual physical cable. So things are great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.700</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've got this chat box.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.340</a></span> | <span class="t">The concept you've just said that set a thief to catch me using that in AI, but isn't that building a not so trustworthy loop because...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Great question.

And I need to look at that breakdown by all the individual steps and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.100</a></span> | <span class="t">measure where that the failures happen. I need to better do these evaluations at every single</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=460" target="_blank">00:07:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">component. It's not just that binary did my agent work, yes or no question. It's at what step in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.340</a></span> | <span class="t">process did my agent fail.

That is really, really important</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=472" target="_blank">00:07:52.860</a></span> | <span class="t">that we have granularity when we look at these things. And then the way we work out these numbers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=477" target="_blank">00:07:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">as I said, we set the thief to catch the thief. We use an LLM, or usually multiple calls to an LLM,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=484" target="_blank">00:08:04.620</a></span> | <span class="t">to evaluate the metric. We say to an LLM, with this input, and this information from a RAC system,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=491" target="_blank">00:08:11.820</a></span> | <span class="t">this is the output that came out, score it. And the idea is you use a better LLM to score than the LLM</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.500</a></span> | <span class="t">you use in your application. In your main application, you want the cheapest LLM possible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=503" target="_blank">00:08:23.820</a></span> | <span class="t">because we all like making money.

Going back to your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.700</a></span> | <span class="t">question there. Ideally, you want to use a better LLM to actually do these evaluations. You want to say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.820</a></span> | <span class="t">you'll get a million traces a day. We're going to test, say, 10,000 of them using expensive LLM</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.860</a></span> | <span class="t">to prove that it works. Ideally, you want to use a custom-trained LLM. Something Galileo offers is we</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=530" target="_blank">00:08:50.460</a></span> | <span class="t">have a custom-trained LLM that's a small language model that's designed to be really, really good at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.460</a></span> | <span class="t">evaluations. But the idea is you use this LLM to do it with a well-defined set of prompts to extract</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.220</a></span> | <span class="t">this information. And then you make this in your workflows. And you do this right from day one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=544" target="_blank">00:09:04.860</a></span> | <span class="t">So who is just starting building apps? Anyone who's just started building apps? A few hands. Who's got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=550" target="_blank">00:09:10.380</a></span> | <span class="t">an app in production? Okay. All of you need evaluations like now. The best time to put valuations in is as</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.380</a></span> | <span class="t">you're doing prompt engineering model selection. The second best time is now. So you want to think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.860</a></span> | <span class="t">about this right from the get-go. As you're building an application, you want to start adding those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=567" target="_blank">00:09:27.100</a></span> | <span class="t">evaluations when you're doing your initial prompt engineering, when you're doing your model selection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.940</a></span> | <span class="t">You want to keep those in your dev cycle and your CICD pipelines. And then you want to observe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">these in production as users start throwing garbage at your system. So let's look at a couple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's just a hold of traces from that chatbot with some nice red and green numbers. And I want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.620</a></span> | <span class="t">highlight these three rows. And these rows match what I was trying to do with the chatbot. Okay. So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=591" target="_blank">00:09:51.340</a></span> | <span class="t">first row here, we have got what is my account balance? I'm sure I don't have access to my account</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=596" target="_blank">00:09:56.860</a></span> | <span class="t">information. And I've got two metrics here. Action completion and action advancement. Action completion</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.900</a></span> | <span class="t">is did it actually do the thing it was asked to do? So it measures across the whole flow from the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.340</a></span> | <span class="t">input to the output. Did it actually complete the task that it was asked to do? Action advancement</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=615" target="_blank">00:10:15.340</a></span> | <span class="t">is did it move forward towards the end goal? And they're two very subtly distinct metrics. Now in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=622" target="_blank">00:10:22.700</a></span> | <span class="t">case of the first one, what's my account balance? I don't know. Don't know anything. Didn't complete,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=628" target="_blank">00:10:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">didn't advance. So we know there's a problem with that one. Second one, what is the balance of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.060</a></span> | <span class="t">checking account? Didn't complete. I don't have a balance, but it advanced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So I can see that yes, it realized that it needs to know the name of the account. So it advanced one</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=643" target="_blank">00:10:43.740</a></span> | <span class="t">step further. So I can say actually, yes, with this kind of prompt, it advances. And then finally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=648" target="_blank">00:10:48.700</a></span> | <span class="t">when I say yes, my checking account is called checking account, it completed, gave me the results,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and it could show the advance way through. So I can see from these metrics, which prompts worked,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=657" target="_blank">00:10:57.580</a></span> | <span class="t">which prompts didn't work. And I can use this to continue improve what I'm doing. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously, these numbers are kind of a whole overarching number across the whole thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, I kind of need to have some form of breakdown. So that's what I've got here. This is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=672" target="_blank">00:11:12.940</a></span> | <span class="t">individual trace that comes in. It's a call CLM. The LM decides to call a tool, pulls data, decides to call the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.340</a></span> | <span class="t">LLM to process that data and show it out the other side. And that's showing those steps.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=684" target="_blank">00:11:24.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And at each level, I can get whatever metrics are relevant. So I can look at the overarching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=690" target="_blank">00:11:30.860</a></span> | <span class="t">It's red. It's a bad thing because it's red. And then I can dive into each individual step and see why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=697" target="_blank">00:11:37.180</a></span> | <span class="t">it's red and look at all those different layers. And that's really, really important. You have to have this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=700" target="_blank">00:11:40.860</a></span> | <span class="t">understanding of the architecture of your agentic systems so that you can do this analysis at each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">individual level. And then depending on what's happening, you can then farm out the fixing of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.780</a></span> | <span class="t">problem to the relevant team. Maybe it's your rank application is terrible. Maybe you need to tune</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=718" target="_blank">00:11:58.140</a></span> | <span class="t">one of your prompts. But by having this level of granularity, you can make those smart decisions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.420</a></span> | <span class="t">around it. Now, what's also cool is this is a lot of unstructured data. What do we know that is good for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">working with unstructured data? AI. Yes. And so what's cool as well is when you start putting an LM over the top of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=738" target="_blank">00:12:18.860</a></span> | <span class="t">this, you can get some really smart insights coming out. So this is some insights that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=744" target="_blank">00:12:24.220</a></span> | <span class="t">generated. Basically, an AI will go against all the data and say, this metric is low. How can I make it better?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=751" target="_blank">00:12:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is really cool. And this is saying, yeah, the LM occasionally fails to use the get balance tool when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=756" target="_blank">00:12:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">asked about account balances. And that's basically the fundamental problem. When I say, what is the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">balance of my account? What would you expect to happen in a chatbot? What's the balance of my account? What would you expect?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyone? Shout out. To get your balance. Exactly. Yeah. And probably if you have multiple accounts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.980</a></span> | <span class="t">you would get the balance of all your accounts. Yeah. This is your checking, savings, credit card, 401k,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.180</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever. And so it kind of makes sense to improve the effectiveness, to get us closer to where we all</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=785" target="_blank">00:13:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">have a consensus that this agent is working, would be for if I say, give me the account balance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.660</a></span> | <span class="t">it goes to all the accounts and it shows me all the balances. So the suggested action here is adding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.700</a></span> | <span class="t">explicit instructions to my system message. So not only have I identified this problem through my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.700</a></span> | <span class="t">evaluations, but I've got a suggestion for fixing it. Now, it's not automatically going to fix it for me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=807" target="_blank">00:13:27.740</a></span> | <span class="t">because there'd be dragons in that because what if that mucks up and they need to evaluate my automatic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">fixings in my evaluations and the snake swallows its tail. But this has given me suggestions. So the human</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.540</a></span> | <span class="t">in the loop, and that's really important, as a human, I can look at this and say, yeah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.460</a></span> | <span class="t">this is the fix that I want to make. Now, I do want to emphasize that whole human in the loop thing is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=829" target="_blank">00:13:49.260</a></span> | <span class="t">really, really important. So when you're generating metrics, there's no guarantee the metrics you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.860</a></span> | <span class="t">generate are actually going to be correct. Because the AI, going back to your question over there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.420</a></span> | <span class="t">the AI could get it wrong. And so one thing you want to do is make sure that you're using a system that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.060</a></span> | <span class="t">has human feedback, like CLHF continuous learning by human feedback. You can, you want humans to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=849" target="_blank">00:14:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">evaluate the numbers and say, okay, this is actually working. The metric was low. Here's the reason.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=855" target="_blank">00:14:15.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Retune and have that continuous training of your metrics because your metrics will never be perfect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.100</a></span> | <span class="t">out the box. You need this continuous level of training.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=865" target="_blank">00:14:25.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So to get this all right, what do we have to do? Step one, add evaluations to your agent. As I said,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.620</a></span> | <span class="t">the best time to do it is before you even start. The second best time is now. If you don't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.700</a></span> | <span class="t">evaluations, get them in now so you can make sure your agent is not making stuff up. You do not want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.580</a></span> | <span class="t">to be the next Chicago Sun-Times. Then you need to measure precisely what you need. Different tools,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.780</a></span> | <span class="t">different applications have different measurements of what they need. Do I need to measure whether the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=893" target="_blank">00:14:53.660</a></span> | <span class="t">input and outputs are being toxic? Do I need to measure for the hallucinations? Do I need to measure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=900" target="_blank">00:15:00.140</a></span> | <span class="t">for a comprehensible output? Do I need to measure for RAG? Do I have some kind of custom measurement that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=905" target="_blank">00:15:05.500</a></span> | <span class="t">only I know about that's specific to my use case? You want to be defining those measurements and those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=910" target="_blank">00:15:10.220</a></span> | <span class="t">metrics up front as you are thinking about your prompts, your structure of your app, your agents.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=915" target="_blank">00:15:15.580</a></span> | <span class="t">Right at design time, you think about exactly what we need to measure. And then as you build it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.500</a></span> | <span class="t">keep that going all through your production. This is not just a test in dev. Because let's be honest,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=926" target="_blank">00:15:26.300</a></span> | <span class="t">when users get hold of your system, they do stuff you don't expect. How many times have you tested</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">something to the nth degree and it breaks the second a user gets on it? Damn those users. But they do things you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">don't expect. And so you have to have this in production as well to make sure that you've got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=941" target="_blank">00:15:41.340</a></span> | <span class="t">everything in place. And then you want to have this real-time prevention. You want to have alerting when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.740</a></span> | <span class="t">it goes wrong. If your AI agent goes rogue, maybe you need to be woken up. So that is how you can tame</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXm4Wcw4m8&t=950" target="_blank">00:15:50.940</a></span> | <span class="t">AI agents with evaluations.
