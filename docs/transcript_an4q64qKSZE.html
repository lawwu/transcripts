She was going to write a book at the same time. She was going to write it on managing. I was going to write it on just investing and rentals. And we sat down at a Starbucks and we made a commitment to ourselves and said, we will not leave this Starbucks until our book is 100% perfectly outlined.</p><p>It's like the Abe Lincoln quote. If I had six hours to chop down a tree, I would spend the first four sharpening my ax. So what this whole strategy was like, I'm going to spend a focused, dedicated nonstop period of time to sharpen the ax. So for me, I sat down, I spec'd out the entire book on note cards.</p><p>It was like 12 chapters, 12 sub chapters, flip every card over and it had an outline of what that sub chapter is going to be about. So every day I had a note card for a hundred days straight with what chapter it's in, what the sub chapter is, and then three, four, five bullet points on what I had to write.</p><p>Well, that's easy. Now I just got to write 500 words to a thousand words a day. And within exactly 100 days later, my wife and I both finished a book.</p></div></div></body></html>
