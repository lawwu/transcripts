Everyone knows about Pompeii, but there was another nearby town called Herculaneum, and Herculaneum was sort of like the Beverly Hills to Pompeii, so big villas, big houses, fancy people.</p><p>And in Herculaneum, there was one villa in particular that was enormous, and it had once been owned by the father-in-law of Julius Caesar, and so, well-connected guy. And it was full of beautiful statues and marbles and art, but it was also the home to a huge library of papyrus scrolls.</p><p>And so when the villa was buried, the volcano actually, it spit out enormous quantities of mud and ash, and it buried Herculaneum in particular in something like 20 meters of material. So it wasn't like a thin layer. It was a very thick layer. Those towns were buried and forgotten for hundreds of years.</p><p>No one even knew exactly where they were until the 1700s. And so in 1750, a farm worker who was digging a well kind of in the outskirts of Herculaneum struck this marble paving stone of a path that had been at this huge villa. And of course, he was pretty far down when he did that.</p><p>He was 60 feet down. And then subsequently, this Swiss engineer came in and started digging tunnels from that well shaft, and they found all these treasures. And that was sort of the spirit at the time was like looting. They were taking out like incredible, if they encountered a wall, they would just bust through it.</p><p>And they were taking out these beautiful bronze statues that had survived. And along the way, they kept encountering these lumps of what looked like charcoal. They weren't sure what they were, and many were apparently thrown away until someone noticed a little bit of writing on one of them. And they realized they were papyrus scrolls.</p><p>And there were hundreds, there may have been thousands of them. And so they had uncovered really this enormous library is the only library ever to have sort of survived in any form, even though it was badly damaged. They were sort of carbonized, very fragile, deformed. The only one that survived since antiquity.</p><p>In the open air, these papyrus scrolls in like a Mediterranean climate, they rot and they decay quickly. And so they'd have to be recopied by monks like every hundred years or so, maybe even less. And so we only have, it's estimated, you know, something like less than 1%, less than 1% of all the writing from that period.</p><p>And so to find underground hundreds of definitely not in good condition, but still present, you know, papyrus scrolls were on a few of them, you can make out the lettering was like this enormous discovery. People immediately in a well-meaning attempt to read them started trying to open them. But they're, they're really fragile, like, you know, they're like, they turn to ash in your hand.</p><p>And so hundreds were destroyed. People did things like cut them with daggers down the middle. And, you know, a bunch of little pieces would flake off and they'd try to like, get a few letters off of a couple of pieces. And then eventually there was a monk named Piaggio, who's an Italian monk.</p><p>And he devised this machine kind of under the care of the Vatican to unroll these things very, very slowly, like half a centimeter a day, something like that. And a typical scroll, I think, could be 15 or 20 or 30 feet long, and managed to successfully unroll a few of these.</p><p>And they found on them, Greek philosophical texts in the Epicurean tradition by this little known philosopher named Philodemus. But we got kind of new text from antiquity, which is not a thing that happens all the time. Eventually, people stopped trying to physically unroll these things because so many were destroyed.</p><p>And in fact, some attempts to physically unroll the scrolls continued even into like the 2000s, like 1990s, 2000s, and, and they were destroyed. So the current situation is we have 600 plus kind of roughly intact scrolls that we can't open. And I heard, I heard about this, and I thought that was incredibly exciting, like the idea that there was information from 2000 years in the past, we don't know what's in these things.</p><p>And obviously, people are trying to develop new ways and new technologies to open them. And I read about a professor at the University of Kentucky, Brent Seals, who had been trying to scan these using increasingly advanced imaging techniques, and then use computer vision techniques and machine learning to kind of virtually unroll them without ever opening them.</p><p>And they tried a lot of different things. But their most recent attempt in 2019 was to take the scrolls to a particle accelerator in Oxford, England, called the Diamond Flight Source, and to make essentially an incredibly high resolution CT scan of the sort of 3D x-ray scan. And they needed really high energy photons in order to do this, and they were able to take scans at eight microns, so these really quite tiny voxels, which they thought would be sufficient.</p><p>And I thought this was like the coolest thing ever. You know, we're using technology to sort of read this lost information from the past, and I sort of waited for the news that they had been decoded successfully. So that was, you know, 2020. And then I think COVID hit, everybody got a little bit slowed down by that.</p><p>And last year, I found myself wondering, I wonder what happened to, you know, Dr. Seals and his scroll project. And I reached out, and it turned out they'd been making really good progress. You know, they'd gotten some machine learning models to start to identify ink inside of the scrolls, but they hadn't yet extracted words or passages.</p><p>It's very challenging. And I invited him to come out to California and hang out, and to my shock, he did. And we got to talking and decided to team up and try to crack this thing. And the approach that we've settled on to do that is to actually launch an open competition.</p><p>We're going to, we've done a ton of work with his team to get the data into a shape where, and the tools and techniques and just the broad understanding of the materials into a shape where smart people can kind of approach it and get productive easily. And then I'm putting up together with Daniel Gross, a prize, you know, sort of like an X prize or something like that for the first person or team who can actually read like substantial amounts of real text from one of these scrolls without opening them.</p><p>And so we're launching that this week, you know, I guess maybe it's when, when this airs, I don't know. The stakes are kind of big, like this, like what gets me excited are the stakes. So the six or 800 scrolls that are there, it's estimated that if we could read all of them and, you know, somehow the technique works and it generalizes to all the scrolls, then that would give us approximately a doubling of the total text that we have from antiquity.</p><p>This is what historians and classicists tell me. So it's not like, oh, we would get like a 5% bump or a 10% bump in the total ancient Roman or Greek text. It would be like, no, we get all of the texts that we have. Again, you know, multiple Shakespeare's is sort of one of the units that I've heard.</p><p>So, so that, that would be significant. I mean, we don't know what's in there. You know, we've got a few Philodemus texts. Those are of some interest, but there could be lost epic poems or God knows what. So I'm really excited. And I think, you know, my bet is there's like a 50% chance that someone will encounter this opportunity and get the data and get nerd sniped by it.</p><p>And we'll solve it this year. Um, I want to make tangible, like what could be gained if we can unwrap these? So you said there's a few more thousand scrolls. Are we talking about the ones in a Philodemus's layer? Are we talking about the ones in other layers? You know, you'd think if you find this crazy Villa that was owned by Julius Caesar's father-in-law that we just like dig the whole thing out.</p><p>Um, but in fact, most of the exploration occurred in the 1700s through the Swiss engineers tunnels underground. So it was never, the Villa was never dug out and exposed to the air. You went down 50, 60 feet and then you dig tunnels. And, you know, again, they were looking for treasure, not like a full archeological exploration.</p><p>So they mostly got treasure. In the nineties, some additional excavations were done kind of at the edge of the Villa. And they discovered a couple of things. First, they discovered this, like it was a seaside Villa that faced the ocean. It was right on the water before the volcano erupted.</p><p>The eruption actually pushed the shoreline out by depositing so much additional mud there. So it's no longer right by the ocean, apparently. I've actually never been. And they also found that there were two additional floors in the Villa that the tunnels apparently had never excavated. And so at most, a third of the Villa has been excavated.</p><p>Now they also know when they were discovering these papyrus scrolls that they found basically one little room where most of the scrolls were. And these were mostly these Philodemus texts, at least that's what we know. And they found apparently several revisions, sometimes at the same text. And so they think the hypothesis is this was actually Philodemus's working library.</p><p>He worked here, this sort of Epicurean philosopher. And in the hallways though, they occasionally found other scrolls, including crates of them. And the belief is, at least this is what historians have told me, and I'm no expert, but what they have told me is they think that the main library in this Villa has probably not been excavated.</p><p>And that the main library may be a Latin library and may contain literary texts, historical texts, other things. And that it could be much larger. Now I don't know how prone these classicists are to wishful thinking. It is a romantic idea, but they have some evidence in the presence of these partly evacuated sort of scrolls that were found in hallways and that sort of thing.</p><p>So there are descriptions. I've since gone and read a bunch of the first-hand accounts of the excavations. And there are these heartbreaking descriptions of them finding an entire case of scrolls in Latin and accidentally destroying it as they tried to get it out of the mud. And there were maybe 30 scrolls or something in there.</p><p>So there clearly was some other stuff that we just haven't got to.</p></div></div></body></html>
