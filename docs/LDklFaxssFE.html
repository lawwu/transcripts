The paper she published is extremely high-quality work and extremely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=59" target="_blank">00:00:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">interesting. And I was thrilled to discover that her background included learning from my courses,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=68" target="_blank">00:01:08.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and fast AI courses, and we stayed in touch. Everything I saw Sarah do was incredibly impressive,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">and so I wanted more than anything else to find an opportunity to work with her. So we offered her</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=82" target="_blank">00:01:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">this role as a Answer.ai fellow. So Sarah, maybe to start with, could you summarize for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=95" target="_blank">00:01:35.040</a></span> | <span class="t">somewhat layperson audience the research that you were presenting at NeurIPS? What was the purpose of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the work, of the research you were doing, and what did you find?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">NeurIPS: Sure. So I started this project, I think, towards the beginning of 2023. At that time,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">ChatGPT was still relatively, or I think, yeah, relatively young. And we were interested in doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">this thing with multi-step reasoning. So at the time, these large language models really struggled with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=128" target="_blank">00:02:08.560</a></span> | <span class="t">producing coherent and correct mathematical reasoning and logic. And so we were interested in finding ways</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=136" target="_blank">00:02:16.320</a></span> | <span class="t">to improve that. So one of the papers that we kind of based our approach off of was from OpenAI. They</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">used these reward models as verifiers to kind of verify whether these steps in a multi-step reasoning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">process would be correct or incorrect. And what was interesting about their approach was that instead</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.360</a></span> | <span class="t">of having one reward model that would produce a single reward, kind of telling you whether the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">solution was correct or incorrect or somewhat of a mix between the two, this would basically grade each</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">step. So it would tell you where exactly the response went wrong. And yeah, it would give you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=175" target="_blank">00:02:55.920</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of a more specific kind of feedback in terms of that. Let's talk about OpenAI for a moment then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">before coming back to how you built on this, because this is very much in the news now. So OpenAI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.080</a></span> | <span class="t">recently released a pair of new models called 01 Preview and 01 Mini, which are dramatically better at</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.640</a></span> | <span class="t">reasoning than previous models. And they seem to be taking advantage of a training system that uses this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=204" target="_blank">00:03:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of approach. OpenAI have explained how they've been explicitly taught how to or been given feedback</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.280</a></span> | <span class="t">on their reasoning steps and have learned to become better reasoners as a result. So it's interesting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">that it seems this, you picked a problem which I think not coincidentally has turned out to be really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.760</a></span> | <span class="t">important in practice. Right. And so kind of more on that, the actual origins of our project weren't on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">mathematical reasoning. Originally, we had been looking at sort of bias in models in terms of the more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">like kind of like ethical implications. And we realized that a lot of times, like statements were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=247" target="_blank">00:04:07.840</a></span> | <span class="t">not logically connected with each other. And so this kind of led us down the route of logical reasoning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But yeah, that was kind of a tangent. But back to the actual... How did you build on top of then that OpenAI work?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">Did you take it in a different direction or you kind of took it a little further in the same direction or what?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I mean, the PRM paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. So basically what we did was they basically only trained the rarefires.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">They showed that the more process reasoning oriented ones were better than the objective,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.800</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of holistic ones. And so we decided to take it one step further and actually use it in an RLHF pipeline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to update a sort of like completion model. And so...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=293" target="_blank">00:04:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">I know this is a second nature to use, so let's just rewind a bit. So RLHF is reinforcement learning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">from human feedback. So this is the third step in the process that OpenAI used to build stuff like the ChatGPT model,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">where they get human beings to give feedback about different possible answers to a question,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=312" target="_blank">00:05:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">and it helps the model learn better what human beings are looking for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=317" target="_blank">00:05:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So typically a human is given two model responses.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=324" target="_blank">00:05:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">the human rates it or picks the better one out of the two. And then based on that preference data,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=331" target="_blank">00:05:31.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like a reward model was trained. But for us, we were... There was a dataset released by OpenAI that had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=336" target="_blank">00:05:36.880</a></span> | <span class="t">that like process feedback where individual steps were rated incorrect or correct by human graders,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=343" target="_blank">00:05:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and we trained a reward model based on that. And so in terms of like the actual RLHF pipeline,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.640</a></span> | <span class="t">there were a few key changes that we had to make just because the setup of our, I guess, process was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=356" target="_blank">00:05:56.720</a></span> | <span class="t">a little different. I can talk on those a little bit more, but I don't know if you have any more like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.440</a></span> | <span class="t">conceptual questions or any clarification. Oh, that's okay. So I just wanted to kind of... I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">think it helps to start, you know, with like where... what you've been working on recently. So basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=371" target="_blank">00:06:11.680</a></span> | <span class="t">it's taking a really kind of classic branch of research that turned out to be of great practical</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=377" target="_blank">00:06:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">import, which is moving from just like, is this a good answer or not? To, is this a good series of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">steps to get to an answer or not? And then building on that to then say, okay, with that, we can then</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=387" target="_blank">00:06:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">hopefully come up with a model which can actually create the correct steps and as a result doesn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=394" target="_blank">00:06:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">have to jump straight to the answer straight away. And yeah, in TLDR, your model</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">had encouraging results. I mean, you weren't able to train it on the large amount of compute you would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=408" target="_blank">00:06:48.800</a></span> | <span class="t">have liked since high school researchers don't have access to open AI computers. But it looked good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=415" target="_blank">00:06:55.760</a></span> | <span class="t">enough at least to get an Europe's paper. So actually, I wanted to kind of then step back a bit to say,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.960</a></span> | <span class="t">like, right, I've... through my work with fast.ai, I would say, like, every year there's maybe a couple of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">high school students who I come across who do fast.ai and, you know, become an extremely competent</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=446" target="_blank">00:07:26.560</a></span> | <span class="t">practitioner. And so I've kind of got to know a few folks like you. And generally, the experience is like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=455" target="_blank">00:07:35.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a bit tricky because there aren't other people at school who have the same interests and capabilities,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.760</a></span> | <span class="t">either teachers or students. So, you know, how did this work? How did this work for you? How did you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=473" target="_blank">00:07:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">get into artificial intelligence and how did you then follow that interest, even though I assume</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=481" target="_blank">00:08:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you did not have a group of peers who were following that interest with you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=486" target="_blank">00:08:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, you're definitely right about the peers thing. I think I started towards the end of middle</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=493" target="_blank">00:08:13.760</a></span> | <span class="t">school beginning of high school. What kind of age is that? I don't know what middle school is in America.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, okay. Yeah, I think I was, like, 13, 14 years old. And so I had taken, like, an algebra one course</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=506" target="_blank">00:08:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">at, like, the highest math level. But my brother was taking the course because he's much older than me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=512" target="_blank">00:08:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">He's, you know, interested in this sort of thing. And so I was like, hey, let me, you know, watch and let me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">follow along. And I think, like, the one thing that kind of parried me through the course, if you will,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=524" target="_blank">00:08:44.320</a></span> | <span class="t">is, was actually, like, the kind of ease of, like, I don't know, just watching the lectures, playing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=529" target="_blank">00:08:49.520</a></span> | <span class="t">around with the notebooks. It was something... For those we haven't done it, I'll just explain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">there that, like, fast AI course is a bit unusual in that even though we do get to the point of, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=538" target="_blank">00:08:58.960</a></span> | <span class="t">re-implementing recent research papers, we do it in this top-down way where you start out, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.600</a></span> | <span class="t">building stuff, basically. So it's, it's... And then you kind of only gradually get into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=553" target="_blank">00:09:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">complexity of the underlying implementation as needed. So I guess you're saying that was, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=558" target="_blank">00:09:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">helpful for you as a teenager in working through it? Yes, very. I think I liked starting out with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=564" target="_blank">00:09:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">like, the higher level ideas just because I got to see how they kind of worked. I feel like if you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=570" target="_blank">00:09:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">probably started with, I don't know, like, backpropagation or, like, any of those, like, you know, fancy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=576" target="_blank">00:09:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">calculus things. That's right, calculus. Hmm. But, yeah, it was just nice being able to start out with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">like, a bigger picture view of things. And that was definitely interesting. I had no idea. Did you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and your brother help each other? Were you kind of co-studying? We kind of co-studied in, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.400</a></span> | <span class="t">the very beginning. I think we watched, like, a lecture or two together. But as time progressed,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=598" target="_blank">00:09:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like, I realized that I didn't really, like, need him there next to me. Things were more or less</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.120</a></span> | <span class="t">understandable. I think there was, like, a forum, too. If I had any, like, questions, I could, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">go and, like, see if there was any other issues. Have you used that? Hmm?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=610" target="_blank">00:10:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">You used the forum? I was mostly, like, like a watcher. Yeah. Like, afar, kind of, if anyone had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.400</a></span> | <span class="t">similar questions, that would be super helpful. Wasn't too much of a poster myself. But it's very,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=625" target="_blank">00:10:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it was very cool being able to see, like, a bunch of people kind of following along and doing their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">own thing. Like, even if, like, my close friends weren't doing it, the only person I knew was doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=634" target="_blank">00:10:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">was my brother, who's, like, much older than me. It was nice, like, to think about having, like, that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=639" target="_blank">00:10:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of, like, I don't know, there's just, like, a community of people online that are just really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=644" target="_blank">00:10:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">curious and driven. Exactly. I remember a teenage girl from Bangladesh emailing me to say, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=652" target="_blank">00:10:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">hey, I've just finished the fast AI course. This seems really important and really good. But, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=658" target="_blank">00:10:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">all my friends think it's weird. And, like, I don't know anybody else that, like, really uses computers</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=662" target="_blank">00:11:02.880</a></span> | <span class="t">much. So, like, is it okay? Am I doing something wrong? And I was like, no, it'd be better than okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.960</a></span> | <span class="t">It's amazing, you know. And she went on to get a fellowship at Google and got flown out to Silicon</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=673" target="_blank">00:11:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Valley. But, you know, it can be, yeah, it can be a bit weird. And actually, I remember you telling me</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that going to Neurips was pretty important for you because suddenly you were surrounded by real-life</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">versions of these people and realized, like, oh, it's not this figure, right? That must have been amazing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=692" target="_blank">00:11:32.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.

It was, like, one thing to, like, I don't know, kind of just, like, see the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=698" target="_blank">00:11:38.560</a></span> | <span class="t">presentations and talk and talks and whatever, but, like, actually walking through, like, the poster</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=703" target="_blank">00:11:43.280</a></span> | <span class="t">halls and getting to, like, ask people about their research. Like, wow, these people, like, are also</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=707" target="_blank">00:11:47.840</a></span> | <span class="t">interested in the same things and they, like, spend so much time doing, like, or, like, asking the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=712" target="_blank">00:11:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">questions that I'm interested in and things like that. This is a conference with, like, 10,000 AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=717" target="_blank">00:11:57.680</a></span> | <span class="t">researchers or something all coming into New Orleans and everywhere you go around the conference</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=722" target="_blank">00:12:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">building. All the pubs and restaurants are full of AI researchers. Yeah, it's pretty insane.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I felt a bit the same way when I first went to San Francisco, you know, coming from Australia, where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.680</a></span> | <span class="t">my interests were... I didn't really know anybody else who had them. And it was nice to suddenly find</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=741" target="_blank">00:12:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">myself in a town with lots of other people who thought that what I was doing was interesting and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=746" target="_blank">00:12:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">they cared. Like, it matters, you know. But you must have had a lot of tenacity because you were going</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=753" target="_blank">00:12:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">for, what, four or five years before you got to that point. I mean, that must have been a huge amount</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=758" target="_blank">00:12:38.800</a></span> | <span class="t">of work for you. Yeah, I think, like, just, like, it was kind of my, like, side hustle. Like, after</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.200</a></span> | <span class="t">school I'd have, you know, extra free time. This would be sort of my thing. I think part of it was also,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">like, AI was kind of getting, you know, hot in the news. I was responsible for a ton of things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=778" target="_blank">00:12:58.560</a></span> | <span class="t">really cool papers, really cool breakthrough algorithms. And it felt like I was, like, in on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">something, you know, because more or less, like, I could understand, like, what was going on. I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=791" target="_blank">00:13:11.280</a></span> | <span class="t">like, there was, like, this headline, I think, about, like, AlphaFold. And I was like, wait, like, I know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of, more or less, what's going on there. And so that kind of helped.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But that was the protein folding model from Google, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=802" target="_blank">00:13:22.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. And it had, like, one, it had solved the protein folding problem as, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=810" target="_blank">00:13:30.960</a></span> | <span class="t">the headlines kind of reported. And so that kind of, like, helped me kind of stay interested,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.320</a></span> | <span class="t">stay driven. And I guess it kind of just, like, blossomed once I, like, hit high school. And I was</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=824" target="_blank">00:13:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">in this program called MIT Primes that typically pairs students with, like, graduate students or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=831" target="_blank">00:13:51.440</a></span> | <span class="t">professors, high school students with graduate students and professors to do this sort of, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.680</a></span> | <span class="t">research project. And so for me, I was paired with Vlad Lielin, who was a PhD student at UMass Lowell,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=844" target="_blank">00:14:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and now he's graduated with his PhD.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And he became your co-author on your NeurIPS paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=848" target="_blank">00:14:08.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, who is my mentor and co-author and basically taught me everything I need to know about AI research.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=854" target="_blank">00:14:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But through that program, I was able to kind of take on, like, a new perspective. Because this entire</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">time, I'd been kind of, like, a student. I'd kind of, like, learned about these things, kind of played</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=866" target="_blank">00:14:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">with them, kind of analyzed them from, like, the top down, picked apart their inner workings more or less.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=872" target="_blank">00:14:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But now I was kind of presented with the question of, like, so what, like, what's next, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=876" target="_blank">00:14:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Can I just rewind for a bit, like, about the side hustle? Because, like, as a homeschooling dad,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=883" target="_blank">00:14:43.840</a></span> | <span class="t">this kind of interests me, because I think it might be somewhat more aligned with how I think about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=889" target="_blank">00:14:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, school education. You know, rather than spending more time doing your math homework,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you are spending time doing something that's not in the curriculum. But if I'm thinking about it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=903" target="_blank">00:15:03.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm thinking, okay, you're doing fast AI. Lesson four, you have to use the chain rule in calculus,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=912" target="_blank">00:15:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">which you would not have done in algebra one. So you must have been, like, I don't know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=919" target="_blank">00:15:19.680</a></span> | <span class="t">what were you doing, like, going to Khan Academy and stuff like that to kind of learn this stuff. And,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=923" target="_blank">00:15:23.440</a></span> | <span class="t">like, I imagine that then by the time you covered it in high school, it would have been reasonably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=928" target="_blank">00:15:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">straightforward for you because you've been applying it for years at that point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. I realized, like, I'd taken multivariable at some point in high school, and I was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=936" target="_blank">00:15:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">wait, like, these concepts are very, very familiar to me. But I think, like, you're right in the sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=942" target="_blank">00:15:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that, like, for me, a lot of things were nonlinear. I think, like, in American schooling,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=948" target="_blank">00:15:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">especially, like, there's a very, you know, straightforward progression from algebra one,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=953" target="_blank">00:15:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to, you know, geometry, to whatever, to eventually calculus. And I think, like, because I was just so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=960" target="_blank">00:16:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">interested in, like, AI, machine learning and things like that, I kind of just, like, took the initiative</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=965" target="_blank">00:16:05.920</a></span> | <span class="t">and learned things that I needed to know. And so when it actually came time for math class, like, a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=972" target="_blank">00:16:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">things felt out of order just because they weren't... Yeah, and you would have been better at that math</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.200</a></span> | <span class="t">because you knew what was important, you knew what it was for. Like, as you know, my eight-year-old has</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.400</a></span> | <span class="t">recently started learning derivatives, and it's definitely not in her curriculum, but, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.480</a></span> | <span class="t">we don't follow the curriculum because I figure, like, yeah, if you do fun and interesting stuff,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=995" target="_blank">00:16:35.440</a></span> | <span class="t">then it all comes around eventually. And, you know, yeah, I'm just trying to think, like, what about,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">like, I mean, coding even more so, right? Like, in the US curriculum, I don't think there's much coding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1009" target="_blank">00:16:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">at high school generally, but in the fast AI course, you would have had to have become reasonably proficient</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1014" target="_blank">00:16:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">in Python to succeed there. So I think I was lucky enough to have, like, a few Python classes at my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1022" target="_blank">00:17:02.800</a></span> | <span class="t">middle school, but then again, very different ways of, like, thinking about programming. I think a lot of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1028" target="_blank">00:17:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like, introductory programming classes, I don't know, they're very, like, game-centered. I feel like a lot</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1035" target="_blank">00:17:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">of the, like, intro classes, you just, like, solve a puzzle and that's, like, the entire course. But I think,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1042" target="_blank">00:17:22.880</a></span> | <span class="t">like, what's helpful about, I don't know, fast AI and maybe just, like, Python in general is that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">it's pretty readable. I think a lot of the notebooks for fast AI, they were on Colab, so I didn't have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1054" target="_blank">00:17:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to worry about, like, a terminal or, like, VS code and things that were that, you know, more complex.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, you just pick a link and start typing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Go button.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1062" target="_blank">00:17:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1063" target="_blank">00:17:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly. So that was nice. And then also, there were, like, a ton of resources online at that point. Even now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1070" target="_blank">00:17:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">like, you know, there's, like, ChatGPT, there's AI magic, like, you can literally just, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1075" target="_blank">00:17:55.520</a></span> | <span class="t">it's the barrier to access is definitely much lower nowadays. But it's just something that I had to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1082" target="_blank">00:18:02.560</a></span> | <span class="t">learn on the fly. And thankfully, there were enough resources to do so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, sorry, people watching this, but AI magic's an internal tool at AnswerAI, so you don't get to use it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1092" target="_blank">00:18:12.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe I shouldn't have said that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1094" target="_blank">00:18:14.800</a></span> | <span class="t">That's fine. No, the fact that it exists is a known thing. I talked about it on the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">podcast ages ago, so.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1101" target="_blank">00:18:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Glad I haven't spilled the beans.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1103" target="_blank">00:18:23.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Now you've just increased the mystery.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, so let's fast forward a little bit. So you actually started working part-time at AnswerAI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1117" target="_blank">00:18:37.840</a></span> | <span class="t">before you even finished high school. And then, you know, we had a bit of a conversation about what next</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1126" target="_blank">00:18:46.240</a></span> | <span class="t">for you. And you felt like MIT was the right place for you to be. So you've been there now for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1132" target="_blank">00:18:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">a few months, I guess. And I think you're living there at MIT, right? I'd love to hear, like, what's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1142" target="_blank">00:19:02.640</a></span> | <span class="t">your experience been so far? Because, like, again, like, I'm imagining first year at MIT,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1147" target="_blank">00:19:07.440</a></span> | <span class="t">there's still not going to be loads of people, either students or teachers you're dealing with, who</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1152" target="_blank">00:19:12.720</a></span> | <span class="t">know enough about AI to be published at Europe's. Like, have you found, like, yeah, tell me about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1159" target="_blank">00:19:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">experience in general, and also whether you've, you know, kind of how you're, you know, whether you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1164" target="_blank">00:19:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">mainly continuing to kind of work with Vlad, and of course, we'll talk shortly about your NSAI work,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1169" target="_blank">00:19:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">and how that's what you're learning and experiencing and stuff at MIT.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1174" target="_blank">00:19:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so I think when I first started talking to you about AnswerAI, kind of working there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">doing a fellowship, I really seriously considered taking a gap year, so that I could, you know, pursue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">my research projects a little more seriously, have a little more time on my hands. But ultimately, I decided</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1195" target="_blank">00:19:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">against it just because I feel like MIT is such, like, I hate to say this, it sounds like so basic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1202" target="_blank">00:20:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">but it's such, like, a great place to be. I think you're definitely right. Like, again, none of my</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">peers, or like, not none, but like, the majority of my peers aren't really interested in AI. But they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">amazing people. They, I don't know, there's just a very broad variety in like, what they're interested</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1221" target="_blank">00:20:21.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in. And they're all super, super passionate about it. And I think like, if I think about my future,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1227" target="_blank">00:20:27.280</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know, five, 10 years down the line, I'm not exactly sure where I'll be. Maybe it'll be doing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1234" target="_blank">00:20:34.160</a></span> | <span class="t">AI research, maybe it'll be entirely something else. And I think having that exposure to people that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.160</a></span> | <span class="t">interested in other things, people that are the top of their field and whatever that might be is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1244" target="_blank">00:20:44.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it's very exciting. And so, yeah, I guess, like, I guess that's it. Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1251" target="_blank">00:20:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so at the same time, so you're kind of, you know, got this multi-pronged thing going on where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1256" target="_blank">00:20:56.480</a></span> | <span class="t">you're working at Answer.ai, you're also doing an MIT, I guess, where your new side hustle used to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1262" target="_blank">00:21:02.320</a></span> | <span class="t">fast AI. You've been working with Austin Huang, who is one of the absolute top AI practitioners</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.560</a></span> | <span class="t">in the world. He was a project leader at Google, you know, building the retrieval stuff for Google's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1278" target="_blank">00:21:18.080</a></span> | <span class="t">deep learning models that became Gemini. He's the creator of Gemma.cpp.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1285" target="_blank">00:21:25.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. What's it been like, you know, getting involved with working with folks like Austin,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1293" target="_blank">00:21:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, what's been surprising about it or, you know, what kind of, what's the experience been like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1300" target="_blank">00:21:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">there? Yeah. So I think at first I was definitely a little intimidated. The laundry list of cool things</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1307" target="_blank">00:21:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Austin has done is just, like, insane. But I realized, like, over time, like, Austin and, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1315" target="_blank">00:21:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">the rest of the crew at Answer.ai, they're very down to earth, very happy to, like, explain concepts,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1320" target="_blank">00:22:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">very happy to answer questions. And I think that's, like, one of the things I've enjoyed the most about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1325" target="_blank">00:22:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">working with Austin. So for some context, we put together WebGPU puzzles. And so through that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1334" target="_blank">00:22:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I had to kind of, like, let's just take a look at that then, shall we? Yeah, sure.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1338" target="_blank">00:22:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's GPU CPP.answer.ai. Okay. Okay. So you and Austin built this together. Yes. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1349" target="_blank">00:22:29.120</a></span> | <span class="t">let's talk a bit about what this is. So this is like, let's go through a few here. These are some pretty</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1358" target="_blank">00:22:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">hardcore things. Basically, what you're doing here, things like a 1D convolution, a prefix sum,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1365" target="_blank">00:22:45.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you're asking people to write code, fill in something to, you know, what is a fairly complex</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1378" target="_blank">00:22:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">thing written in hardcore, low-level GPU code? Sorry. Kind of, yeah, hardcore, low-level GPU code,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1391" target="_blank">00:23:11.840</a></span> | <span class="t">which, if it's taught at university at all, it would be, like, probably in, like, a master's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1398" target="_blank">00:23:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">program or something like that. It's just, like, it's extremely, extremely, extremely advanced.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And you're also doing it in, like, a brand new framework that Austin invented. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1413" target="_blank">00:23:33.440</a></span> | <span class="t">it kind of reminds me a bit of Ada Lovelace in some ways, like, you know, she was the first computer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1421" target="_blank">00:23:41.360</a></span> | <span class="t">programmer. And she was programming a computer that had just been invented.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1426" target="_blank">00:23:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, how do you... Yeah, I mean, is that your background? You've got years of hardcore,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1436" target="_blank">00:23:56.080</a></span> | <span class="t">CUDA, GPU, low-level background of programming. Like, how did you implement and contribute to this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1443" target="_blank">00:24:03.360</a></span> | <span class="t">project? No, I think my entire GPU programming background was probably, like, the three hours I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1451" target="_blank">00:24:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">spent solving Sasha Rush's GPU programming puzzles. And that was really fun for me. But in terms of just,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1459" target="_blank">00:24:19.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like, getting this, putting this together, I think, like, learning on the fly again was, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1464" target="_blank">00:24:24.800</a></span> | <span class="t">a huge thing for me. And also just, like, knowing that the framework wasn't complete. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1470" target="_blank">00:24:30.080</a></span> | <span class="t">if I had, like, any questions, that Austin would be more than happy to answer them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1474" target="_blank">00:24:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's nice to have the guy that wrote the framework there to ask questions about... Exactly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1477" target="_blank">00:24:37.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. But another thing that I kind of just, like, reminded myself of was that... So for a little</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1484" target="_blank">00:24:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">context, Sasha Rush is, I believe, a professor at Cornell. He wrote these GPU puzzles. You can run them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1490" target="_blank">00:24:50.960</a></span> | <span class="t">in CoLab. But the idea is basically to kind of distill down the ideas behind, you know, this sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1498" target="_blank">00:24:58.080</a></span> | <span class="t">paradigm of, like, parallel GPU computing, and then have it presented in a very fun, interactive,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1503" target="_blank">00:25:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">sort of, like, puzzle-solving way. And so through that, I kind of learned, like, hey, like, this is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1511" target="_blank">00:25:11.040</a></span> | <span class="t">how you actually think in parallel, essentially. And so when I was implementing these, the web GPU version,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1519" target="_blank">00:25:19.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I kind of reminded myself that, like, hey, even though this is, like, a new framework, things are a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1524" target="_blank">00:25:24.160</a></span> | <span class="t">little hacky here and there, like, the essential idea is the same. And for me, the goal for these puzzles</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1532" target="_blank">00:25:32.560</a></span> | <span class="t">was the same, kind of, along the lines of the experience I had with Sasha Rush's, kind of just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1538" target="_blank">00:25:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">distilling down those really core ideas into something that beginners could digest, anyone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1544" target="_blank">00:25:44.720</a></span> | <span class="t">could digest, and really have, like, a fun time with. And so that's kind of, like, my, like, overarching</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1550" target="_blank">00:25:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">philosophy when it came to these puzzles. Yeah, I mean, I just think it's very... It is inspiring,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1556" target="_blank">00:25:56.240</a></span> | <span class="t">though, right, because I hear so many people say, you can't expect to make any progress in a career in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1564" target="_blank">00:26:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">AI research or practice without a PhD. And, you know, you are so slow, Sarah, you still don't have a PhD,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1573" target="_blank">00:26:13.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, my goodness. And yet, you know, like, many, many, many fast AI alumni, I'm not saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1581" target="_blank">00:26:21.600</a></span> | <span class="t">fast AI is the unique way to do this, but it's a very common way to do this, you've forged a great</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1586" target="_blank">00:26:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">path. And, you know, to be honest, I did encourage you to consider joining Answer AI full-time at least for a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1593" target="_blank">00:26:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">year, like, your strength, you know, your portfolio is strong enough that we're just about the hardest</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1602" target="_blank">00:26:42.160</a></span> | <span class="t">company in the world to get into, and we're offering you a position. So it's, it's definitely works out,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1608" target="_blank">00:26:48.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, I do want to ask, though, like, a lot of people judge on things other than your pure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1618" target="_blank">00:26:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">demonstrated competence. A lot of people will at least implicitly judge based on, you know, the fact</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1625" target="_blank">00:27:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that somebody is very young, or the fact that somebody is female. And so I'm thinking, for example,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1633" target="_blank">00:27:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">my friend Tanishk, who finished high school when he was 10, and he wanted to go to university. And he, him and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1643" target="_blank">00:27:23.280</a></span> | <span class="t">his family faced a lot of prejudice, you know, and struggled to get somebody to understand that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1649" target="_blank">00:27:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">he was ready to go to university. And when he finally found a, you know, professor ready to take</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1658" target="_blank">00:27:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">him on, they were right, he shone at university, and he went on to finish a really impressive PhD, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1668" target="_blank">00:27:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so I think he beat you to that one. Although you beat him to a New York's publication. So tough,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1673" target="_blank">00:27:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">tough crowd. But, you know, it was a struggle. And, you know, I'm kind of curious to hear, like, it sounds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1680" target="_blank">00:28:00.800</a></span> | <span class="t">like, maybe, I guess, in their case, his family were trying to get him to learn through a really classic,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1690" target="_blank">00:28:10.800</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, stop going to school, start going to university. By doing it kind of more on your own,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1697" target="_blank">00:28:17.520</a></span> | <span class="t">online, like, has that mean there's been like less of a struggle for you? Or has there been times you've</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1702" target="_blank">00:28:22.960</a></span> | <span class="t">found it a bit challenging to get people to take you seriously based, you know, on your age or gender or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1708" target="_blank">00:28:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">anything else? Well, I think the nice thing about having, you know, fast AI, answer AI, kind of my research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1716" target="_blank">00:28:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">as my side hustle, is that, you know, it's kind of less of, I guess, like, a part of my life as in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1727" target="_blank">00:28:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">comparison to maybe what Tanish did, like he graduated high school when he was 10, which is like an insane</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1733" target="_blank">00:28:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">thing to do. And I mean, really, the only option for him afterwards was like college. I feel like, generally,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1740" target="_blank">00:29:00.640</a></span> | <span class="t">like my trajectory and kind of like my main hustle kind of route was very, more or less typical. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1749" target="_blank">00:29:09.200</a></span> | <span class="t">so not having not being like, I didn't really kind of face not being taken seriously or things like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1755" target="_blank">00:29:15.840</a></span> | <span class="t">that, just because it kind of was more of a side hustle thing for me. And, but to be fair, like if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1762" target="_blank">00:29:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">it were to be a main hustle, I guess I could see, definitely see how that might kind of suck. I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1769" target="_blank">00:29:29.600</a></span> | <span class="t">think there are definitely people out there that are like programs out there, especially like the MIT</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1775" target="_blank">00:29:35.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Primes program that tries to kind of help out these like younger students kind of unlock that, I guess,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1782" target="_blank">00:29:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">potential. Yeah, so-called like Vlad put in his time to invest in your success.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1787" target="_blank">00:29:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, he was telling me, he thought like, at the beginning, when the directors of the program reached</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1793" target="_blank">00:29:53.280</a></span> | <span class="t">out to him and asked if you would help, he was like, this is going to be like a ginormous waste of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1797" target="_blank">00:29:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">time. But me and the student that he mentored before me, both published papers. And so that was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1805" target="_blank">00:30:05.040</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of eye opening, I think, like, I've heard around MIT, and just, in general, like, you do need to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1811" target="_blank">00:30:11.760</a></span> | <span class="t">have like, or like, the word on the street is that you need to have a PhD, you need to have some sort</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1816" target="_blank">00:30:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">of like higher level education in order to do these more like researchy and more like, I don't know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1821" target="_blank">00:30:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">like interesting jobs. But I think that that's sort of, it's a little odd to me, because...</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1826" target="_blank">00:30:26.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, I mean, like, I think you're getting a bit of a like, you're seeing how it is now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1832" target="_blank">00:30:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And what you're saying is true now. Maybe at some points, it was a little less true. But like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1839" target="_blank">00:30:39.280</a></span> | <span class="t">right now, there are a few people in the world who have more experience with modern AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1846" target="_blank">00:30:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">than you, with your whatever, five or six years, like, it's, it's on the higher end,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1853" target="_blank">00:30:53.440</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, and for somebody who spent 20 years learning, I don't know, Lisp and Prologue and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1860" target="_blank">00:31:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Bayesian statistics and whatever, they're probably going to take five or six years to unlearn that enough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1867" target="_blank">00:31:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">to be able to start where you were when you were 13. So, like, for me, this is like a bit of a super</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1874" target="_blank">00:31:14.080</a></span> | <span class="t">power we have at Answer AI, is we basically totally ignore academic credentials and entirely focus on,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1881" target="_blank">00:31:21.200</a></span> | <span class="t">like, portfolio, you know. And yeah, a lot of the folks that we end up wanting to work with are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1890" target="_blank">00:31:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">younger, you know, and often they never went to a fancy educational institution like MIT,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1898" target="_blank">00:31:38.240</a></span> | <span class="t">because they were off forging their own thing. So I think, yeah, I think it is like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1902" target="_blank">00:31:42.560</a></span> | <span class="t">I think your experience should become the new norm, it'll probably take decades to get there,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1909" target="_blank">00:31:49.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you know.

Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1913" target="_blank">00:31:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, I guess another thing about, you know, being a woman in tech in general,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1924" target="_blank">00:32:04.560</a></span> | <span class="t">it helps to have people who, you know, can help mentor you and so forth. So it's nice, like, we've got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1931" target="_blank">00:32:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Audrey at Answer AI who was the founding president of Pi Ladies and probably knows more about how to deal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1938" target="_blank">00:32:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">with all that stuff than probably anybody in the world. So, yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1943" target="_blank">00:32:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, and I think, like, tying back to the MIT thing, I think another part of the reason why</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1949" target="_blank">00:32:29.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I wanted to come to MIT was there are just so many people interested in tech</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1954" target="_blank">00:32:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">that are women. And it's definitely hard to find anywhere else. We have to keep it 50/50 for, I guess,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1961" target="_blank">00:32:41.760</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever's sake. So it's a good high concentration of, I think, like, women that are interested.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1968" target="_blank">00:32:48.560</a></span> | <span class="t">No, I mean, it matters. Of course it matters. Absolutely. And it's important to end up somewhere</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=1973" target="_blank">00:32:53.360</a></span> | <span class="t">where you're going to do your best work surrounded by people you can do your best work with.

Yeah. Well, you know, how are you feeling about this research field that you got</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2008" target="_blank">00:33:28.480</a></span> | <span class="t">into a year or two ago? And are you planning to keep pushing on that yourself? Or is it like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2014" target="_blank">00:33:34.800</a></span> | <span class="t">oh, it's too mainstream now, time to do something else? No, I think this is definitely very exciting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2020" target="_blank">00:33:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">for me. I think, like, hey, like, I chose the right path that people at OpenAI are doing it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2024" target="_blank">00:33:44.640</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think, like, in general, there are, along with OpenAI that I actually don't know what's going on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2030" target="_blank">00:33:50.480</a></span> | <span class="t">with the hood apart from, like, Twitter rumors. But there have been kind of, like, a bunch of papers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2035" target="_blank">00:33:55.280</a></span> | <span class="t">two, I believe there's one called, like, QuietStar, a few more along similar lines that kind of deal</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2041" target="_blank">00:34:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">with the same problem. And I think this is, like, one of the one of the bigger questions with large</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2047" target="_blank">00:34:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">language models is that can we, like, because large language models, they, they kind of infer things,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2053" target="_blank">00:34:13.520</a></span> | <span class="t">like, they have this sort of representation of language and therefore sort of, like, logic and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2062" target="_blank">00:34:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">knowledge. And somehow we need to, somehow they kind of put those things together in a way that is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2068" target="_blank">00:34:28.080</a></span> | <span class="t">coherent. But how do we actually, like, extract the things that we want, right? So I think that's gonna</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2075" target="_blank">00:34:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">stay a big question, whether it's reasoning, whether it's truth, whether it's kind of, like, knowing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2083" target="_blank">00:34:43.120</a></span> | <span class="t">like, what things go with what things, like, I don't know if that was clear. But yeah, I can, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2088" target="_blank">00:34:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">rerun that, too, if you want to. No, no, it's all good. Absolutely. Okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2093" target="_blank">00:34:53.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, I mean, I mean, the reason I asked is I, I sometimes wonder that with myself, I'm like, I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2100" target="_blank">00:35:00.560</a></span> | <span class="t">kind of like to poke at the areas that no one else is doing, you know, so like, if somebody is, sometimes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2108" target="_blank">00:35:08.640</a></span> | <span class="t">if something, if something becomes super popular, like, okay, I'm bad, like, even with, like, ULM fit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2114" target="_blank">00:35:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, that was the first kind of real large language model, you know, language model kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2120" target="_blank">00:35:20.240</a></span> | <span class="t">application of that kind. And then suddenly everybody was doing it. And I kind of felt like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2127" target="_blank">00:35:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">okay, maybe I don't need to be doing this now, because lots of people are doing it, like, there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2130" target="_blank">00:35:30.880</a></span> | <span class="t">something else I could, you know, uncover. It's, I guess that's a tricky thing with research is, like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2137" target="_blank">00:35:37.200</a></span> | <span class="t">do you want to keep uncovering in the same direction? Or do you want to explore new directions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2142" target="_blank">00:35:42.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Are there other kind of directions of research you've been thinking, like, oh, maybe when you're done with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2146" target="_blank">00:35:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">this, you'd like to go in this other way? Well, I mean, just being an answer, I feel like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2152" target="_blank">00:35:52.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I've been exposed to sort of a lot of the different types of like research. I did like a few tangential</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2159" target="_blank">00:35:59.280</a></span> | <span class="t">tasks, just kind of like exploring the different projects that was that were going on. And one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2164" target="_blank">00:36:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">the things that I haven't touched in a long time was kind of creating like an application, like a research</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2170" target="_blank">00:36:10.480</a></span> | <span class="t">buddy sort of type of thing. Um, and it's not as researchy as like my previous projects. Um,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2180" target="_blank">00:36:20.720</a></span> | <span class="t">but I think like being able to kind of create something with like an end user in mind is something</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2187" target="_blank">00:36:27.440</a></span> | <span class="t">else that I want to, um, definitely pursue during my time. That's kind of our thing, isn't it? You know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2192" target="_blank">00:36:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">our thing at Answer.ai is all about research and development with an end user task and a specific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2200" target="_blank">00:36:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">end user in mind. Exactly. And so kind of being able to still kind of experiment with different</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2208" target="_blank">00:36:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">ideas, having that sort of researchy aspect, but also, I don't know, working towards a very tangible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2212" target="_blank">00:36:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">purpose, um, would be very cool. So, so before we wrap up, I guess like, um, anybody who's watched to this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2221" target="_blank">00:37:01.760</a></span> | <span class="t">point at the interview, I'm thinking, you know, uh, are we thinking, well, I want to be more like Sarah,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2229" target="_blank">00:37:09.040</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, I think you're a really inspiring role model for people.

Um, but I was fortunate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2306" target="_blank">00:38:26.160</a></span> | <span class="t">enough to have discovered it quite early on. And I just knew that I was very interested in it. And</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDklFaxssFE&t=2312" target="_blank">00:38:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">obviously there were times where, like you said, like things got hard.
