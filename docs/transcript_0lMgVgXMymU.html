So someone's like, well, what about this? What about this? And then you get this like weird congealed idea where instead I'm like, okay, pause.</p><p>What are we sending this in? And they're like, this is going to be at the top of our newsletter for a company for all of our employees to read. I'm like, okay, so let's keep it just two, three paragraphs at most. Let's try to include an image that's interesting and let's try to make it something that can help them.</p><p>And then it could be something about like, here's how to get the most out of your 401k with XYZ company. Here's how to get the best healthcare from XYZ company. Here's the wins that we had at XYZ company that you can tell your family that we did. And what happens is we start spitballing ideas and everyone goes like, oh, I know that that one's really interesting.</p><p>Everyone asks about that all the time. Then I'm like, that's the concept that we're going to go after, right?</p></div></div></body></html>
