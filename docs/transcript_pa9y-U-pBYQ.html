And the irony was, it was like, I wasn't really doing anything. Like I was doing less. I was saying less. I wasn't trying as hard. I happened to be conveying more confidence. I was able to get the buyers to offer more of their suggestions.</p><p>Like everything just started going my way. And so we started to develop this system that it was like what we use in the edit bay of a three-minute scene. Like you can't have a scene go more than three minutes. You have to resolve all the conflict, blah, blah, blah.</p><p>It's like, there's a lot of science behind three minutes itself about how the human brain processes information and makes decisions. And so I just realized like I'm using this three-minute rule across everything. And when I started to apply that across other businesses besides television, it worked even better than it did in television.</p></div></div></body></html>
