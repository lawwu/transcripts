I guess you would have to say, you know, define successful. Haiti wasn't successful if you meant creating a prosperous state that would last for a long time. I mean, Haiti, to no small extent, because of the, you know, incredible blockade that was put on it by all the other nations, wasn't, is, you know, in terrible shape.</p><p>There's a great, great Brazilian classic called Osho Toys by a guy named Acuna. It's an amazing translation, very good translation in English under rebellion in the backlands. And what it is about is in the 1880s, the creation of a hybrid state of, you know, runaway slaves and so forth, and how they had essentially kept their independence and lack of supervision informally from the time of colonialism.</p><p>And now the new Brazilian state is trying to, you know, take control and they fight them, you know, to the last person.</p></div></div></body></html>
