Well, if you look at the view drafts thing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=874" target="_blank">00:14:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">that's always been one of its strengths is that it will format it three different ways for you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=877" target="_blank">00:14:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">by default, if you go to the top, right, so you can just sort of cycle through them.

Someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=940" target="_blank">00:15:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">as sophisticated as Saks may be able to, but the average person will just be like, this is good</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=945" target="_blank">00:15:45.680</a></span> | <span class="t">enough. They've got distribution.

That's the platform advantage. Can I show you an answer? I think it's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.720</a></span> | <span class="t">super hallucinating on so I asked it, what is David Saks written about SAS?

Now, let's assume that's imputed interest rate at what you would need to finance that 4%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=2104" target="_blank">00:35:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think 4% you have to calculate the duration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=2107" target="_blank">00:35:07.520</a></span> | <span class="t">I understand, but just always gonna be baseline. Yeah, let's just baseline. So let's say 4%.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=2112" target="_blank">00:35:12.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So 4% on 50 trillion is 2 trillion a year.

And that's what that's my point. That's why you have to see taxes go up to over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=2126" target="_blank">00:35:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">70%.

I think the thing you guys have to be open</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=2328" target="_blank">00:38:48.480</a></span> | <span class="t">to is the fact that we've never really tested the ability for the US to borrow durationally beyond</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=2333" target="_blank">00:38:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">30 years. And again, we talked about what an error it was in judgment for the Treasury not to issue</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=2339" target="_blank">00:38:59.600</a></span> | <span class="t">100 year bonds. But I think if there's any country in the world that can issue 100 year bonds, it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=2345" target="_blank">00:39:05.120</a></span> | <span class="t">the United States of America. And I do think that they'll be able to get durational assets that are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=2352" target="_blank">00:39:12.160</a></span> | <span class="t">that far out on the yield curve. So I, again, am less concerned about the debt wall here, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=2357" target="_blank">00:39:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I think you'll be able to push maturities out, you'll be able to refi a bunch of short term</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=2362" target="_blank">00:39:22.320</a></span> | <span class="t">obligations into the future. And if you look at where the yield curve is 10 years at three and a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=2367" target="_blank">00:39:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">half 340 something. So the thought is that inflation goes down. If you put it out to 100</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=2372" target="_blank">00:39:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">years, I would be very surprised if 100 year rates if they priced a bond weren't somewhere</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=2378" target="_blank">00:39:38.880</a></span> | <span class="t">sub 1%. So I do think it becomes effectively free money for the United States. And I think it's just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=2384" target="_blank">00:39:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">a practical thing they need to explore. By the way, corporates have explored these 50 year bonds</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=2389" target="_blank">00:39:49.840</a></span> | <span class="t">and greater. So I think it's just like it's a matter of mathematics, as you guys have just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=2395" target="_blank">00:39:55.040</a></span> | <span class="t">illustrated here, that the US has to push out past 30 years. So we'll have 50 year US bonds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=2399" target="_blank">00:39:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">we'll have 100 year US bonds. Again, I'm not here to claim whether it's right or wrong. But I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=2405" target="_blank">00:40:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">the simple way to acknowledge that is just that we are going to reinflate the money supply over</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=2411" target="_blank">00:40:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">the long term, because it's the only sustainable way that politicians can get elected and reelected.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=2418" target="_blank">00:40:18.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think the best thing to do there is to own risk assets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=2422" target="_blank">00:40:22.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Let's move on to the presidential election real quick.

And he took it to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=3127" target="_blank">00:52:07.360</a></span> | <span class="t">to the most infinite level.

And then you get excited by it. And then all of a sudden, he doesn't actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=3183" target="_blank">00:53:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">deliver it.

I'll go around the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=3196" target="_blank">00:53:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">horn.

So how did CNN pick that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqMzRXCe-xY&t=3221" target="_blank">00:53:41.920</a></span> | <span class="t">audience?
