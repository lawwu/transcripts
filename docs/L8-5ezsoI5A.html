It's like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=36" target="_blank">00:00:36.680</a></span> | <span class="t">you get the horse, you have the wheels, you swap the horse, and you put an engine, which was known</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=40" target="_blank">00:00:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">at the time, and that's a car. But you know what's really hard to predict? Traffic. So it's my job to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=51" target="_blank">00:00:51.160</a></span> | <span class="t">ask, what are the traffic that we're missing, especially with AI?

The final story is,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I was talking with someone from Netflix, and she was like, what happens when we are making so much</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=124" target="_blank">00:02:04.920</a></span> | <span class="t">content personalized to each town in India?

And then I look and they literally signed up two days ago. So we went from sign up to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.120</a></span> | <span class="t">conversion to payment to broadcast in two days. And then this was the CTO telling me that. I was like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.920</a></span> | <span class="t">whoa.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=152" target="_blank">00:02:32.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I basically, I'm about to run out of time. So the mandatory slide, a bunch of users, 25 million,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">raised a bunch of money. We did this with eight people. Some of the people who are using us, an email</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.520</a></span> | <span class="t">that I created for today that is going to prioritize applications.

Okay, everybody. The smartphone was the number one best selling consumer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=183" target="_blank">00:03:03.720</a></span> | <span class="t">product last year. And the laptop was the second. Pop quiz for all you hear. What was the third?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=192" target="_blank">00:03:12.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Apple watch. Wasn't Apple watch. Wasn't the air pod. No, I think I heard it. It was a smart speaker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">500 million smart speakers were sold last year. But why do they still suck? You can barely talk to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=210" target="_blank">00:03:30.600</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no customization. There's no community. There's nothing. That's why we built Open Home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=217" target="_blank">00:03:37.240</a></span> | <span class="t">The very first AI driven smart speaker. And we're letting you guys build smart speakers too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=224" target="_blank">00:03:44.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And we believe here that the future is talking with AI. You should be able to talk seamlessly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.080</a></span> | <span class="t">intuitively. In fact, you shouldn't have to use this really awkward command based language. You should be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=236" target="_blank">00:03:56.040</a></span> | <span class="t">able to just chat naturally. So that's what we're building. And we're letting people here today build</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=241" target="_blank">00:04:01.800</a></span> | <span class="t">their own smart speakers and build them in whatever form that they want. And the key here is developer</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.200</a></span> | <span class="t">ecosystems.

I started my career as the chief of staff for the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.040</a></span> | <span class="t">founder of Splunk, a $30 billion big data company. Then I was on the founding team of MakerDAO, a $5</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=265" target="_blank">00:04:25.320</a></span> | <span class="t">billion developer ecosystem. My co-founder and I raised $50 million for our last business, a big data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.560</a></span> | <span class="t">privacy tool. And we sold that business. But it all came down to developers and really building what people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.280</a></span> | <span class="t">actually wanted. And, well, now with Open Home, we have over 10,000 developers building on Open Home.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.120</a></span> | <span class="t">They're building all kinds of interesting things, all types of different custom smart speakers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.280</a></span> | <span class="t">building interesting voice AI applications.

I'm Alex Atala, building OpenRouter, the first and largest LLM marketplace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1131" target="_blank">00:18:51.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you. I want to tell a little bit about how it started. I co-founded OpenSea in 2017,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1143" target="_blank">00:19:03.640</a></span> | <span class="t">and at the end of 2022, I really wanted to know if inference was going to be a winner-take-all market,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1149" target="_blank">00:19:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">because the way it looked, this could be the largest market in software that has ever happened before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1155" target="_blank">00:19:15.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And the first experiment that we tried was building a Chrome extension to help you bring your own</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1163" target="_blank">00:19:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">language model to any website that supported the protocol. And that eventually evolved into OpenRouter,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1172" target="_blank">00:19:32.360</a></span> | <span class="t">a single place and a single API to get all language models with the best prices, best performance,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1180" target="_blank">00:19:40.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and highest uptime. And the way it works is you just have a single API, you pay once,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1187" target="_blank">00:19:47.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and there's near zero switching costs to move from one model to another. We do all the heavy work to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1192" target="_blank">00:19:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">implement tool calling, edge cases, caching, and give you the best prices and performance possible</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1197" target="_blank">00:19:57.720</a></span> | <span class="t">for your region or wherever your servers are deployed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1201" target="_blank">00:20:01.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And because inference is so important, remember, this might be the most important software market ever,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1206" target="_blank">00:20:06.600</a></span> | <span class="t">it deserves its own marketplace just for language models, optimized for them, including filtering for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.600</a></span> | <span class="t">context, for features, for tool calling, for structured output, and much more. And so we built that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1221" target="_blank">00:20:21.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we built a chat room for you to obviously compare models head-to-head as simply as you do when</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1228" target="_blank">00:20:28.840</a></span> | <span class="t">chatting with people in iMessage. We built fine-grained privacy settings, including API-level controls.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1235" target="_blank">00:20:35.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We built a lot of observability so you could see which models you're using and why. And we built public data in our rankings page, which has become the go-to place for comparing models on the real-world usage and on different categories for the prompts as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And this has grown for the last two months, 10 to 100% every single month, or for the last two years, 10 to 100% every single month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1263" target="_blank">00:21:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">10 to 100% every single month. And scaling it has been a lot of the work that we've done so far.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1269" target="_blank">00:21:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">The fundamental goal here is to make a heterogeneous ecosystem homogeneous, because we believe inference is a commodity.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1277" target="_blank">00:21:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Claude from Bedrock should be the same as Claude from Vertex, Claude from Anthropic, and we do all the abstraction and heavy work to make it that way for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1287" target="_blank">00:21:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to talk a little bit about some of our technical challenges.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1292" target="_blank">00:21:32.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We built our own system, our own middleware for doing inference called plugins, which are kind of like MCPs, except a little bit more powerful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1300" target="_blank">00:21:40.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Because you can call MCPs from inside of them, and you can transform the outputs from language models.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1306" target="_blank">00:21:46.600</a></span> | <span class="t">A bunch of other tricky problems that we've done to make the fastest routing in the market.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1312" target="_blank">00:21:52.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're bringing a lot more features in the coming months, including images, enterprise features, prompt observability, and more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8-5ezsoI5A&t=1321" target="_blank">00:22:01.880</a></span> | <span class="t">So if you're interested, come find me after, or check out our careers page.
