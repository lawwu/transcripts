castle and you walk for 30 minutes and you're at, you know, on some more with some beautiful like steep cliff and it's all accessible and it's there's statues to David Hume and it's there's a whole intellectual culture.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1184" target="_blank">00:19:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You could write

target="_blank">00:19:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it'll be a Dracula book, but really be about sort of how he organized all the difference, you know, because it's complicated.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1204" target="_blank">00:20:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You got to keep the

it'll be like a productivity Dracula thriller.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1215" target="_blank">00:20:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's what I'm gonna do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm right in Edinburgh.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1218" target="_blank">00:20:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1219" target="_blank">00:20:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Chris had a question about the waiting for column on his task boards.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1225" target="_blank">00:20:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So as long time listeners know, I'm an advocate of using task boards instead of list for keeping track of your open professional obligations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1232" target="_blank">00:20:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I say have a different board for every role, have columns on each board for the different categories that you're moving tasks around on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1240" target="_blank">00:20:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Every board should have a waiting for column.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1245" target="_blank">00:20:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if there's something you're waiting to hear back about, like this person has to get back to me with this information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1249" target="_blank">00:20:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm waiting for a draft of the report from this person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1252" target="_blank">00:20:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You can put something on that waiting for column.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1254" target="_blank">00:20:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you don't have to keep track of that in your head.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1256" target="_blank">00:20:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Every time you check your task board, you can, you can just see right away.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1260" target="_blank">00:21:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, these are things I'm waiting to hear back from people for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1262" target="_blank">00:21:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That actually is going to open up a lot of cognitive real estate that otherwise would be caught in these loops and anxiety about forgetting things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1270" target="_blank">00:21:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's an important column to have in any task management system.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Chris's complaint is that his coworkers are unpredictable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1280" target="_blank">00:21:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So if he is waiting for something from someone, he maybe has a note about that on his board.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1285" target="_blank">00:21:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he hasn't forgotten it, but he doesn't know when it's going to come back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1289" target="_blank">00:21:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he doesn't know how to plan his week because he doesn't know what on those waiting for columns will come back this week.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1295" target="_blank">00:21:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And different things require different amounts of time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1297" target="_blank">00:21:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So he doesn't know how much time to put aside for these things because he doesn't know what's actually going to come back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1303" target="_blank">00:21:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, it's a common question or a common issue, Chris, and I have three options for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1309" target="_blank">00:21:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. So option number one. Deal with things that come in the next week, and you can just communicate this with the people you work for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1318" target="_blank">00:21:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I schedule my weeks one week at a time. So just so you know, when something comes in, I will most likely get to it the following week in that next week's plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1329" target="_blank">00:22:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's one thing you can do.

I need a schedule. I need to put aside time to deal with this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1353" target="_blank">00:22:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So when should I expect to have this back by? Great. We now agree on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1357" target="_blank">00:22:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If you need to do it, do a shared calendar event. But instead of for a particular time, it's just a shared all day event that says, you know, Jesse gets back the report.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1365" target="_blank">00:22:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So that shows up on their calendar and hold them to it. So then if they don't do it, there's some people who just won't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1372" target="_blank">00:22:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because they're not organized their time. They live reactively and their lives are stressful and we should feel bad about them and they just won't get it back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1379" target="_blank">00:22:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, then there's a clear consequence. Like, look, I put aside time. We said Wednesday, I put aside time Thursday to work on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1386" target="_blank">00:23:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We blew past that. So, you know, get it to me when you can. But it might be a while now till I can turn it around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1392" target="_blank">00:23:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's like they had a chance to get back. You negotiated a time. They'll learn pretty quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1397" target="_blank">00:23:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Most of the people you work with, you're pretty serious about this. You're pretty tight on your time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1401" target="_blank">00:23:21.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And when you set a when you set a deadline, you've actually put aside time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1404" target="_blank">00:23:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if they don't get it to you in that time, that time is going to be wasted for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1407" target="_blank">00:23:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's going to slow down the whole project. So you'll probably get more compliance that way. So that's your other option.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1411" target="_blank">00:23:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The third option is to schedule less stuff. Maybe you're scheduling your weekly plan too tight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1417" target="_blank">00:23:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You have too many things in your schedule that now you don't have any flexibility when something else comes in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1422" target="_blank">00:23:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I would loosen up my weekly plan. This would be option number three and do more work on your daily plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1427" target="_blank">00:23:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So your weekly plan should maybe be a little more higher altitude. Here's a couple big things we need to get done.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1435" target="_blank">00:23:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's a heuristic. We're working every morning on this, that level of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1439" target="_blank">00:23:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you're not dealing with every major task you want to work on, every major initiative you want to work on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1444" target="_blank">00:24:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You figure that out day to day. Now I'm doing my daily time block plan. I'm going to fill every minute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1449" target="_blank">00:24:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So now if something comes in on Tuesday, it's not like Wednesday has already been completely filled on your weekly plan with every minute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1456" target="_blank">00:24:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When you get to Wednesday, you can figure out what you want to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1460" target="_blank">00:24:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you can integrate this thing that you just got back more easily into your plan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1465" target="_blank">00:24:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So schedule less stuff on your weekly plan. Going along with that, if the issue is your calendar is too full,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1474" target="_blank">00:24:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">so you keep saying yes to all these different meetings and now you don't have enough time left in your day to get the unexpected thing that arrived done or processed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1484" target="_blank">00:24:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Schedule less things on your calendar and maybe have an ethic of I don't schedule things before noon, Tuesdays and Thursdays.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1490" target="_blank">00:24:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't schedule anything at all. Whatever heuristic you need, give yourself breathing room that way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1494" target="_blank">00:24:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So those are your three options. Deal with things the week after it comes in.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1498" target="_blank">00:24:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Two, negotiate deadlines from people so that you can put aside time after those deadlines and hold people to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1504" target="_blank">00:25:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or three, just schedule less stuff on the weekly scale so you have more flexibility day by day to fit in what might fit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1512" target="_blank">00:25:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, so those are a few nitty gritty questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1517" target="_blank">00:25:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to move on in a second here to some more philosophical, psychological questions about the deep life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1522" target="_blank">00:25:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">First, I want to take a brief moment to mention a sponsor that makes this show possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1528" target="_blank">00:25:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is our longtime sponsors, our longtime friends at Blinkist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1534" target="_blank">00:25:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As I always say, ideas are power in today's society and the best source of ideas are books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1542" target="_blank">00:25:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Unlike a tweet, unlike a quip on a podcast, unlike a newsletter, when you're reading a book,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1548" target="_blank">00:25:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">you're reading years of systematic thinking on a topic.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1552" target="_blank">00:25:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're reading the result of probably a whole year of just trying to figure out the right way to express it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1556" target="_blank">00:25:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the highest quality form of ideas you can get, so books should be critical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=1562" target="_blank">00:26:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you figure out what books to read?

For those people in those situations, the relevant scales were larger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2151" target="_blank">00:35:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">At other times of their life or your life, you might be able to do seasonality at smaller scales.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2157" target="_blank">00:35:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Hopefully that helps. I'm working this out in my book. So when that book comes out, which right now we're thinking, by the way, February of 2024.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2168" target="_blank">00:36:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So not the February coming up in a couple months, but the February after that, that's our current target for my slow productivity book coming out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2176" target="_blank">00:36:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">By the time that book comes out, and I've already written a draft of this giant chapter on working at a natural pace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2183" target="_blank">00:36:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">By the time that comes out, I'll have worked out through a lot more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2187" target="_blank">00:36:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll give you a preview though. All right, let me give you a quick preview because you'll all forget about this by February 2024, you'll forgotten about this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2193" target="_blank">00:36:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">One of the stories I've been working on with the case studies I've been working on for that, that chapter is Lin-Manuel Miranda.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2201" target="_blank">00:36:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And his, uh, the premiere of not Hamilton, but in the Heights, this was his first play, Broadway play, won the Tony for best musical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2212" target="_blank">00:36:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then Hamilton came next. And I did a lot of research on, on Miranda because there's this, there's this story of like, look, he's a super precocious guy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2221" target="_blank">00:37:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He debuted in the Heights as a college student, you know, as a college student, uh, he did a production with other college students, you know, this precocious guy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2231" target="_blank">00:37:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But when you actually get into the story of how did they, what he actually did in college and when this play was actually ready to premiere on Broadway, there's a five-year gap between there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2240" target="_blank">00:37:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I really get into how he nurtured this thing over years with ebbing and flowing of energy and other things going on in his life and other jobs that he had, but how he kept coming back to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2250" target="_blank">00:37:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's busy periods and non-busy periods. It, he took his time. It wasn't on this brilliant 19 year old. And then next year I have a Broadway winning hit.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2259" target="_blank">00:37:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's, it's a, one of the stories I work on in that chapter on working on natural pace is Lin-Manuel Miranda's. It's an example of somehow the pace required to create something great is sometimes a long one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2271" target="_blank">00:37:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Another story about this, which I don't have room for it in the book now, but I spent a lot of time researching it was Rachel Carson.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2279" target="_blank">00:37:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Rachel Carson is, you know, as the author of Silent Spring, which created the modern environmental movement about DDT and its impact on, for example, birds.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2289" target="_blank">00:38:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And she actually wrote that not far from here, Silver Spring. Her first breakout book was called the Seas Beneath Us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2298" target="_blank">00:38:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It might be underneath us. I think it was beneath us. It was about the ocean. And if you go back and look at Carson's story, she was working for the U S fisheries, fisheries bureau, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2310" target="_blank">00:38:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This was, she, she had to actually drop out of graduate school because it was the depression and she had to help support her family.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2315" target="_blank">00:38:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">She got a temporary job writing about the ocean for the fisheries bureaus. Actually, she was writing scripts for radio.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2323" target="_blank">00:38:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's they're doing 52, seven minute long radio segments about the sea. And she was writing these and that, that morphed into a full-time job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2330" target="_blank">00:38:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So she was in a world where she was writing about the ocean. She had this job. She wanted to be a full-time writer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2336" target="_blank">00:38:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what she was trying to figure out how to do. And she wrote a book early on about the sea. It was called the sea wind and it didn't do well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2343" target="_blank">00:39:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And she wrote that kind of fast. And so she realized, okay, I've got one more shot at this. If I can write a really successful book, I can quit my job at the fisheries bureau and, and write full time about nature, which is what she wanted to do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2357" target="_blank">00:39:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I did all this research about this really long process. It took her five years to write her next book part-time while she was also working at the fisheries bureau.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2367" target="_blank">00:39:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because she realized this thing has to be great. It has to be so good. It can't be ignored. And so it was this drawn out process with busier periods, other periods where she had to pull back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2378" target="_blank">00:39:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And she crafted this beautiful book where it had all of the modern science about the history of life on earth, which was very new at the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2385" target="_blank">00:39:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And she got it all just right. And she went back and talked to every scientist, confirmed every fact.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2390" target="_blank">00:39:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Then she wrote and rewrote every sentence multiple times. And then she read each sentence out loud to her mom to get the sonority just right. Like, how does this sound? Is the language really working?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2399" target="_blank">00:39:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the time she was done and this book came out, it was a monster hit. 88 weeks in a row on the New York times bestseller list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2408" target="_blank">00:40:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That book she had written five years earlier that didn't sell a, barely sold a copy. They re-released it. New York times bestseller list.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2414" target="_blank">00:40:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The book was so good that in the month before it came out, Bill Sean at the New Yorker excerpted basically half of it in three consecutive issues of the magazine in June of that year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2426" target="_blank">00:40:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This was 1951. Half of the book he excerpted in the New Yorker because he knew there was something so special there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2432" target="_blank">00:40:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So again, these are the type of stories I've been thinking about with the natural pace. Sometimes things take longer. It's up and down, up and down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2441" target="_blank">00:40:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes it's I'm going to the South pole and this is what we're doing for the next hundred days. And then, you know, we'll rest for the year after that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2449" target="_blank">00:40:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So natural pace can mean a lot of things. But the thing that I don't think works is just, I'm just pegged out of 10 day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2458" target="_blank">00:40:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's just my career. We're not wired for that. Different paces matter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2462" target="_blank">00:41:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">How do you find those examples?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2464" target="_blank">00:41:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, yeah, it's a good question. Um, well, I read a lot, so I just, I just, I often have these things in the back of my mind threads to pull.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2476" target="_blank">00:41:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes I just think, I bet there's an interesting story there. Like Lin-Manuel Miranda. I just thought, uh, after I saw Hamilton, like, I just want to know more about this guy's story.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2485" target="_blank">00:41:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Got it. Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2486" target="_blank">00:41:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm really good at researching this. Like I know I can tell you beat by beat starting in college to a Hamilton, what went on with Lin-Manuel Miranda.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2496" target="_blank">00:41:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's pulling from profiles. That's pulling from press releases. That's pulling from obscure articles, like in playbill magazine about, uh, you know, when in the Heights got accepted into this development program up in Connecticut.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2512" target="_blank">00:41:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">A repertory theater has this program to help develop, uh, musical productions and, and, and young playwrights. And they write up these summaries of it, all these pieces I pulled together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2522" target="_blank">00:42:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I see the whole trajectory. And then I look back and say, what are the lessons here? That's hitting me. And that's like with his story, this is what hit me was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2528" target="_blank">00:42:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's not just this precocious genius that came up with the idea and wrote the play as a, as a, in college, actually the version of in the Heights that he released in college, they produced was not very good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2539" target="_blank">00:42:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It didn't have any of the elements that originally had at Winnatoni. He stopped working on it and did another play for the rest of his time at school. And the, the, the play he did was not very good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2549" target="_blank">00:42:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It was, it was really afterwards. It was some alumni of his school who, who looked him up in New York and said, I think there was one element of this that was working.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2559" target="_blank">00:42:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You're introducing a hip hop idiom into an otherwise sort of melodic classic musical theater idiom. And there's something there that's working and they started workshopping and they started, there was this long process where they were, uh, these people owned a theater company in New York.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2577" target="_blank">00:42:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they would, they would bring in actors and they would do readings and he'd work on it and it's this long process. And then eventually, so the book wasn't very good. This was not Miranda strong point was the book for plays like the actual lyrical content.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2591" target="_blank">00:43:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and so they brought in this young playwright and this was so fortuitous. This is a talented playwright who then went on five years later, won a Pulitzer prize.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2600" target="_blank">00:43:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right. So they got this phenomenal talent. She was this phenomenal talent. Uh, so now they had her working and, and now it was like really starting to come together, but it took five years. I mean, the guy had to figure out how to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2611" target="_blank">00:43:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He had this, all this talent. I mean, he's got talent coming out of his eyes, but it was still five years of work and it was up and down. So he was involved in a lot of other things. I, and I talk about a lot of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2621" target="_blank">00:43:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, he was really into this like freestyle rap troop that would tour the country and was a journalist and a reporter and was a, at first a teacher. He went back to his, his school that he attended in high school was a history teacher. All this stuff was going on and it's a much messier, more interesting story.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2639" target="_blank">00:43:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And, but that was the pace that had to happen. I don't think 20 year old Lin-Manuel Miranda could write that play. And then when Hamilton came along, now he had all those skills built and then Hamilton was just, you know, um, I've learned how to swing the bat and I'm going after the whole front record. Like then it was just flexing, like, but it took him all that time to build up the skill base to do something like that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2662" target="_blank">00:44:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. All right. I've completely diverged from whatever Steven was actually asking, just because I like these stories. I did. These are just in my head. Now these like stories of the, the long, slow, careful development of interesting things. And you know, it's what it comes back to is it's not all in my peg at 10 every day. It might be like, what was I doing the last five years? I was slowly cultivating something. Great. It's a different pacing, a different way of thinking about productivity, but I think it's a good one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2689" target="_blank">00:44:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. I don't even know where we are. Let's go back. Let's go. Let's get a new question. Let's start fresh. Jesse, what do we got next?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2695" target="_blank">00:44:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. We've got another engineer, John, 22 years old from so good. They can't ignore you. You talk about career capital. I have an idea for starting a small business and cornering an open market, but I currently work in nine to five. I have financial stability that I can quit my job and spend a few months to, to a year actually really building, fleshing out this idea. Should I go for it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2718" target="_blank">00:45:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, it's interesting. So in, in the full version of John's question, there was like more stuff going on and he was what I now think of as he was push polling me. P O L L I N G, you know, push polling is where you're, you're surveying someone, you're asking them a question, but in the way you word your question, you're trying to, trying to get the respondent to go towards a particular answer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2742" target="_blank">00:45:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you're like, are you, are you in favor of, you know, proposition five, even though it probably means your kids will die a horrible death? Yes or no. Right. Your question is trying to push someone towards the answer you want. John's full question was trying to push, pull me towards. You should definitely quit your job. Like he goes on and on about like, I could do it and I'm young and, and I know this is going on with my job. Like he wants to quit his job and, and pursue this idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2767" target="_blank">00:46:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's why I'm wary. Uh, John is a common trap when thinking about cultivating the deep life is using disruption as a proxy for depth. There's something you're unhappy about your current setup. And it's easy to become convinced that just in the act of making a major change, all the things that make you unhappy are going to go away and you'll, you'll find much more fulfillment. You fixate on the disruption itself.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2794" target="_blank">00:46:34.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Can I make a change? What big change can I make? That change will give me deliverance. I want you to downgrade the importance of disruption. I don't care about that period of disruption. I care about your steady state. And the only way to figure out the right steady state is to have a clear vision of a lifestyle that is meaningful and sustainable to you, all of the aspects of it, and then build a plan for what is a pragmatic way to get from where I am now to this vision of the deep life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2821" target="_blank">00:47:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That is specific to me that I've crafted. I can smell it. I can taste it. I can touch it and it touches all my buttons. It really resonates. And then you work backwards to figure out how you get there. That's what matters to me. Uh, maybe you'll have to do some big disruptions along the way. And maybe that'll feel good for a couple of days, but I don't really care about the disruption. I care about the steady state. Do you have a path to a steady state that is going to get you this lifestyle you've envisioned that is meaningful that resonates for you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2849" target="_blank">00:47:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think you're, you're focusing too much on the disruption itself. What I want you to work on is your vision for five years from now. And if your vision for five years from now, you say that the practical way to get there from where I am now is to have my own business because of the flexibility or the financial resources or whatever it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2868" target="_blank">00:47:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If that comes up as the, a good pragmatic way of getting from here to where this vision you have. Okay, good. Let's put that on the table. And if we're putting having your own business on your table, what's the right way to do this? Uh, the minimize the risk and maximize success. You don't just quit your job and do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2886" target="_blank">00:48:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You read the part of so good. They can't ignore you. That talks about using money as a neutral indicator of value. You figure out how to develop at least a prototype of this business, a small version of this business in your spare time in which you can actually test it in the marketplace.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2900" target="_blank">00:48:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Are people spending money on an early version of this product? Am I able to get clients willing to pay me to consult them for whatever service I think I am going to offer? Can I attract an investor that will actually give me a check will give me money of theirs to further develop this idea? Use that as your main way of assessing. Does this really make sense?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2920" target="_blank">00:48:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then at some point, yeah, you'll maybe transition to doing that full time. I want that transition to be boring. It's so common sensical by the time you make it that it's not even that exciting. Well, of course, I'm going to now do this full time or take a leave of absence. We built it to this point. I have the investor money. We have a reasonable client flow. All we have to do is increase that by a third and we have enough income. I want that to be boring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2942" target="_blank">00:49:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if this is sounding bad to you, if this is sounding like a letdown to you, I think it's because you're focusing on the disruption itself as your savior. Disruption is not a substitute for depth. Disruption cannot give you long term satisfaction. A lifestyle that you have carefully designed that satisfies your vision of a life well lived. That is what you want to get to. That is what matters. The path there needs to be pragmatic, maybe even kind of boring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2970" target="_blank">00:49:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's the destination that accounts, not the radical turns you take early on that I think matters.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2976" target="_blank">00:49:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I get push pulled a lot. Yeah, I mean, I usually edit out those parts of the question. They're like obviously push pulling. There's one other question coming up that was really push pulling. I took a lot of the obvious things out of it, but I get that a lot where it's like, well, I know you would normally say this, but you know, and then nine different things that makes the answer they want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=2999" target="_blank">00:49:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Seem like it's inevitable. And then at the end they say, but what do you think? Can't fool me though. I know when you're push pulling, I get down to the core of the matter. All right, what do we got next?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3010" target="_blank">00:50:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We have a question from M, a PhD student who has to take on a few extra jobs for financial reasons. No matter how much I've tried to out organize what's left on my plate, the fact is I'm overbooked and will be for the next six months. It's a relatively short time to survive, but I'm so tired. What do I do?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3031" target="_blank">00:50:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, and my question here is, what's the bigger plan? Right? Because let's say that if the case is really just you're in this circumstance, or you're in this PhD program and for six months you have to take on these two extra jobs and it's really hard. And then after six months, you're back to your PhD program and that's it. It's just some weird, whatever happenstance, financial happenstance. You have the six month period. Yeah, that's survivable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3056" target="_blank">00:50:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Organize, you simplify other parts of your life and psychologically you prepare yourself for this six months will be hard. People go through very hard six month stretches. This is true. Medical residents do this. My brother was an officer on nuclear submarines. When they're on deployment, they sleep four hours a night in shifts. It's hard, but then the deployment ends. This is possible.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3079" target="_blank">00:51:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I'm worried that there is a deeper issue going on here. There are some alarm bells ringing for me here. What is the lifestyle? And I'm going to come back to exactly what we talked on the last question. What is this vision of a deep life, the specific vision that you have in mind that what you're doing now is a pragmatic path to get there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3100" target="_blank">00:51:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I suspect this is a more complicated morass that you have stumbled into here. It's possible that you have just a more cursory connection to this idea of I just need a PhD because whatever. It's something to do. It's impressive. It's just something I've always thought about. And it doesn't really make sense. Like you have these other financial issues. There's other things going on in your life. It's not like there's some clear vision of, oh, no, no, I'm at this great school.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3127" target="_blank">00:52:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And if I get this PhD, I can have this academic job and I have this whole life I really want. I'm concerned here. And I don't know if this is true, but I'm concerned that this is much more haphazard. It's much more knee-jerk and instinctual. And you're not actually on a pragmatic path towards a well-developed vision of a life well-lived, towards a well-developed vision of a deep life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3146" target="_blank">00:52:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I want you to step back for a second and just go through this exercise. Where do you want to be five years from now? Where are you living? What type of work is it? What's your day-to-day like? What are the sources of stress, the lack of the sources of stress? What's your connection to your community, to a family, to a partner? What are all the aspects? Are you outside? Are you in nature? Are you in a city? What's your fitness? What's your spiritual life like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3167" target="_blank">00:52:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You really have this vision. You have a vision of a deep life that resonates to your core. And then say, what are the shortest distance, most practical paths from where I am today to that vision five years from now? Do that exercise again. And make sure that there's an answer to that exercise that passes through you doing a PhD program right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3189" target="_blank">00:53:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because it's possible you do this exercise and say, actually, having this PhD doesn't connect to any one of these visions. And it doesn't make sense to try to be doing this right now because we have these other maybe unfortunate but unavoidable financial constraints. I need to be supporting my family. The particular program I'm in is not paying me a stipend. I owe the money. I don't have the money.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3210" target="_blank">00:53:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a real clarity that comes from stepping back. Here's the destination. What paths make sense? There's a real clarity to that. And you might find out what you're doing makes complete sense. You have a six-month hiccup. All right, you're the submarine officer. You're hot bunking with someone else. You're sleeping five hours a night. But it all ends when the submarine gets back to port. Fine.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3230" target="_blank">00:53:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But it might instead say, I don't know what I'm, where am I trying to go here? Does this really make sense I'm doing this? Do these type of jobs make sense? Why am I trying to work 14, 15 hour days? Like, is this just going to keep going on? Do I need to completely rethink what I'm trying to do here to make this work? I don't have all the details in. But I do know nothing bad will come from you actually just stepping back right now and clarifying that thinking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3254" target="_blank">00:54:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I have some alarm bells going and I'm worried that there's more structural issues underlying this plan that maybe is coming through in this question.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3264" target="_blank">00:54:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And that happens a lot, Jesse. I think people, I don't, again, I have no idea what's happening with Em, but I'm just using her as a stepping stone for making this more general point. But it's easy to become fixated on milestones on the path to depth that are irrelevant or sometimes even actively an obstacle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3285" target="_blank">00:54:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think we had that prior question where the young man was fixated on, I want to quit my job. Right. So you get fixated on this like act. I quit my job. That's what I need to, all my problems will be solved. How can I quit my job? That's what's really going to matter. But that's a distraction. That's a little milestone. What's the full path? That's what matters. Or, you know, it's easy to get fixated on graduate school happens all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3310" target="_blank">00:55:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. PhD. I don't want to quit. I told people I was doing this and I didn't know what else to do with my life, but it might not at all be the right thing to do. It might be you're at a program that is not a sufficient caliber. It's not putting you on like the track for like a sustainable academic career. It's costing you money. You're at a time in your life where it's actually very difficult to be trying to do this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3330" target="_blank">00:55:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And you don't even really know why you're doing it other than it's like, I don't know. It's what I chose to do. Like I see that issue happen a lot with graduate school as well. And when you, when you're working backwards from a destination and trying to point out pragmatic paths, this really solves a lot of these issues because often you're like, oh, this is the most meandering possible path to that destination. And it goes through the alligator swamp and up this mountain. And I really could just go through this valley over here. And there's a lot of clarity that comes when you have the destination in mind. But especially people earlier in life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3357" target="_blank">00:55:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We just will fixate on things like, well, maybe this will be my savior. If I have this degree or if I quit or if I move and you just get concentrated on the specific without ever thinking about the general common issue. All right. What do we got next? I think we have time for a couple more here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3377" target="_blank">00:56:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Sounds good. Next question is from you, kill a 21 year old student. I'm a computer science student. My third year, my school was closed for an extended period of time during the pandemic. Now that everything is more normal. I just don't want to study for my academic stuff anymore. It feels like an absolute burden, but I don't want to drop out. I only enjoy my deep work sessions when I'm working on my internship or my personal projects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3404" target="_blank">00:56:44.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, Mughal, I included your question. I don't often do student specific questions, but my answer here, I think is relevant beyond just students. This is why I included it here. What I think you're suffering from just based off your question is what I used to call in my newsletter and blog, deep procrastination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3424" target="_blank">00:57:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now this was common in particular among students, high performing students, but it's an issue that affects people outside of school as well. Deep procrastination is different than depression. So with depression, what you have is a a hedonia, the inability to even imagine yourself having positive affect in the future. There's a sort of hopelessness. I can't even imagine ever feeling good again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3449" target="_blank">00:57:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is what you get with depression, with deep procrastination. If this is what you have, with deep procrastination, it's not a hedonia. There's stuff you still enjoy. You can actually have exciting visions for your future. It's a motivational defect. You just can't do your schoolwork or whatever it is your main work is. It's like, I actually can't just get started and do this work. I like this other stuff. I'm still excited about things, but I can't start my term paper.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3475" target="_blank">00:57:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I can't start working on this report. I literally can't muster the motivation to actually go. So I don't know if this is what you're suffering from, but in your elaborated answer, you're talking about like scheduling your work and just not being able to do it. I also picked up a lot of optimism about other stuff in your life. So that's why I think this is deep procrastination and not depression. Though of course I could have this wrong, but let's talk about deep procrastination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3496" target="_blank">00:58:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">What causes it? I used to write a lot about this when I studied, focused more on student issues. And it seemed to be, again, it's a disorder of the motivational system that tends to stem from the combination of a real feeling of extrinsic motivation. So the thing you're doing, you've really lost sight of why you're doing it beyond just like it's expected of you or your parents wanted you to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3519" target="_blank">00:58:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Combined with just the hardship, it's hard. You know, third year of computer science program is hard. Deep procrastination would often emerge, especially with elite college students I would find around this time. Because you have the combination of I'm in this really hard pre-med major. I'm not even really interested in being a doctor, but it was just my parents that it's the only reasonable career. And my courses are getting really hard because I'm no longer in my introductory courses. So the work is really hard.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3547" target="_blank">00:59:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Lack of intrinsic motivation plus difficulty can create this disorder in the motivational system where you actually just lose the ability to do work to the point where you can fail out and have to take semesters off. Like this is due. I'm going to get a zero. I've gotten two extensions. I still can't do it. That's deep procrastination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3566" target="_blank">00:59:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So the way you get out of it is you work on both sides of that problem. So to work on the motivational issue, you now have to do the legwork. And we're coming back to this theme again and again in today's episode, because I think it's such an important theme. You have to do the legwork of figuring out where do I want to be five years from now? What is a vision of my life that is deep and meaningful?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3587" target="_blank">00:59:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Not just how successful do I want to be? How impressive do I want to be? All aspects of your life, where you live, what type of work you do, what that work is like, your connection to other people and community, spiritual, physical, all of this stuff worked out a vision of a life that really resonates with you. And you're working backwards from that to figure out how to get there. And probably, your vision of that life will involve a university level education because probably the type of work that you want to support your vision is going to require that education.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3615" target="_blank">01:00:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So now you have a motivation for your education that's rooted in something you really care about. Okay, so my plan is I do this major, I get these skills, this opens up these type of jobs, which after a few years, I can transition over here and then get to this vision.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3630" target="_blank">01:00:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So now you have an intrinsically cited locus of control, to use the motivational psychology term, on which to build your academic work. You also want to reduce the difficulty of your work. So you're going to throw my type of early productivity habits at it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3645" target="_blank">01:00:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Let me be organized, let me use autopilot schedules, let me study like Darwin. So I'm constantly writing down and optimizing and improving my study habits. If you're just coming off a deep procrastination, you want the easiest possible semesters when you first come back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3659" target="_blank">01:00:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So maybe do a light load, put in some easier courses, leverage credits you already have. So you can have two courses instead of three, four courses instead of five. So you want to bring down the difficulty while bringing up the intrinsic quality of your motivation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3676" target="_blank">01:01:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The final thing I might point you towards is I had a series I wrote on my blog back in 2008, maybe, you can just Google, calnewport.com romantic scholar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3689" target="_blank">01:01:29.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I had a series of articles about how to infuse an intrinsic love of learning back into your college experience as a insurance policy against deep procrastination. And it's all about injecting into your life elements that signal to yourself that you're interested in this material beyond just the instrumental need to get a grade that'll help you get a job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3712" target="_blank">01:01:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's you're going to lectures, you're reading books, you're had a famous post on this called Heidegger with Hefeweizen. You're at a pub and you're reading a book on this topic just for no other reason than you're interested. And you start signaling to yourself that I enjoy the academic life, I enjoy these topics, there's intrinsic value in it. That really matters to you and your brain in warding off deep procrastination.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3735" target="_blank">01:02:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a common problem that we don't talk about enough. It's a disorder of the motivational system. I think a lot of people felt this outside of the academic context during the pandemic. The pandemic was a real source of deep procrastination for a lot of knowledge workers in particular.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3750" target="_blank">01:02:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is what I think is going on. So hopefully that type of advice is relevant beyond just the students, which is really the epicenter of where I first started observing this issue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3762" target="_blank">01:02:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, let's do one more question before we get to our books.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3767" target="_blank">01:02:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">- All right, sounds good. This is from Peter. You were recently mentioned in a marketing email from a planner company. Here's the quote. Instead of scheduling your day by the hour, Newport suggests organizing your day into distinct longer time blocks. By scheduling your tasks by morning, afternoon, and evening, you can focus on your work rather than your tasks.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3787" target="_blank">01:03:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">This is basically the opposite of your actual recommendations for time blocking. Does it bother you when people do this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3794" target="_blank">01:03:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">- It happens, Peter. If you're at all in the public eye, especially in the idea space, people will get your ideas wrong. Sometimes it is innocent in the sense of, I don't know, this planner company was trying to cite me to promote better organizational habits and got me wrong.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3815" target="_blank">01:03:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And yeah, the way they're citing me incorrectly, I suppose, fits well with their particular product. But they probably just really think, like, yeah, doesn't Cal say something like this? Where this happens more often will be more sort of social critic idea writers who will ascribe some kind of crazy straw man theory to me, often the opposite of what I preach, and then do a takedown of that idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3840" target="_blank">01:04:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And be like, look how sort of smart I am. What I've learned about that particular thing is, A, it's nice that people think of you as someone to try to set up a straw man for and take down. Like, wow, I must really be, my name recognition must be growing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3856" target="_blank">01:04:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, people actually think enough people know my name that taking down a fake theory of never a spouse will make them look better. So I take some pride in that. It's like, oh, that's great. You know me enough to dislike me. That's a step in the right direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3870" target="_blank">01:04:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And two, often these writers aren't very good. And so I think a lot of the readers when they read these takedowns, because the takedowns themselves are often kind of annoying and sanctimonious. They're like, oh, this is Cal Newport guy. Honestly, if this is the person this person's against, I want to check this guy out. Maybe he'll have something smart to say. So actually, I think it might even help me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3889" target="_blank">01:04:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But you know, Peter, I think that stuff happens. And I'm used to it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3895" target="_blank">01:04:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">For people that are new to the show, can you explain the more specifics of your time blocking and how that quotes?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3902" target="_blank">01:05:02.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, so that, yeah, so this quote was saying, don't schedule your day by the hour, but instead have three big blocks, morning, afternoon and evening and didn't say like, what do you want to do in each of those blocks? And they're like, yeah, this is what Newport recommends. It's not what I recommend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3918" target="_blank">01:05:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I actually recommend giving every minute of your workday a job. So time blocking says you look at your day and you assign specific work to specific time. So you don't just say, here's all the things I want to do this morning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3930" target="_blank">01:05:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Does that fit? How long are these things going to take? How long is your morning? What do you want to do when? That's not nearly detailed enough. What I would say, like, no, you say this thing I'm doing during this half hour and then the next hour I'm going to work on this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3942" target="_blank">01:05:42.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And then I have a call and then I have a half hour between the next call and during that half hour, I'm going to try to get these three tasks done. You actually are assigning the specific time to specific tasks. So you actually have to give every minute a job.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3954" target="_blank">01:05:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It forces you to face the reality of how much time you actually have available. It forces you to learn about how overly optimistic you are about how long things take, because when you're new to time blocking, your plans don't work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3966" target="_blank">01:06:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Everyone at first, when they time block plans for the best case possible scenario, as opposed to planning how long things are actually going to take. So you learn pretty quickly, oh, I'm not going to empty my inbox in this 30 minute window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3978" target="_blank">01:06:18.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That takes 90 minutes or this meeting, I say an hour, but it's really going to take 90 minutes. Then I need another 30 minutes just to make sense of what was said there. So I really need to put aside two hours.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=3987" target="_blank">01:06:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You learn about the reality of how long work takes and you spread it out more realistically. And three, time blocking allows you to better make use of the time you have available, because when you see the whole board, you can start moving your pieces around more strategically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4001" target="_blank">01:06:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I got it. This morning block is open. Let me put something hard there. This 30 minute block between back to back meetings, I'm going to be toast. Why don't I just do these three errands there where you don't have to actually shift into a deep work mindset and try to solve a big problem?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4016" target="_blank">01:06:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You know what? This meeting here makes nothing work. But if I move this, I can merge these two blocks together and actually get this chapter done. So now I know I should move this meeting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4027" target="_blank">01:07:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can actually see the whole board, you can make much better place. So that planning company is wrong. Don't break your day up into two morning afternoon blocks. Actually give every minute of your workday a job. It's a much better way to make use of your time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4042" target="_blank">01:07:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, let me talk. I want to talk about the books I read last month in November. Before I do, let me just briefly mention another sponsor that makes this show possible. And that is our friends at My Body Tutor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4056" target="_blank">01:07:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I've known Adam Gilbert, My Body Tutor's founder for many years. He used to be the fitness advice guy on my blog back in 2007, 2008. So I've known him for a long time. His company, My Body Tutor, is a 100% online coaching program that solves the biggest problem in health and fitness, which is lack of consistency.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4077" target="_blank">01:07:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The way they do this is by giving you an online coach who works with you to develop your nutrition plan, to develop your fitness plan, and then you report back to this coach every single day. And that coach gives you feedback every single day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4092" target="_blank">01:08:12.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So by having another person in the loop, you actually get more, you actually are much more likely to be consistent and get it done. But because it's online, so you don't have to have a trainer come to your house, it's done through the internet. It doesn't have to cost all the dollars in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4108" target="_blank">01:08:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So it's a great idea. It was always a very successful company. But during the pandemic, I think My Body Tutor emerged as a big company. Like it really made a lot of sense. It's very popular.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4119" target="_blank">01:08:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So Adam and his coaches are great. They're the best in the world at delivering highly personal accountability and coaching. So if you're serious about getting fit, go to My Body Tutor and mention deep questions when you sign up and they will give you $50 off your first month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4134" target="_blank">01:08:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's at mybodytutor.com. Mention deep questions and get $50 off your first month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4141" target="_blank">01:09:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I also want to talk about our friends at ExpressVPN. I am a big believer. I talk about this all the time on the show. I am a big believer in using a VPN, that's short for virtual private network.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4162" target="_blank">01:09:22.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now the way a VPN works is instead of just directly connecting from your device to whatever website or service you want to access, you instead form a secure encrypted connection to a VPN server.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4176" target="_blank">01:09:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">You then tell that server through your secure encrypted connection, this is the actual website or service I want to connect to. And the server does that on your behalf and then sends you back to results through this secure encrypted connection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4188" target="_blank">01:09:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So everyone who is monitoring what you're saying has no idea where you're going, no idea what website you're reading, no idea what service you're connecting to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4198" target="_blank">01:09:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Here's the thing, people are monitoring. In fact, even your internet provider could be keeping track of your internet traffic and selling that information to advertisers.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4211" target="_blank">01:10:11.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We're talking AT&T, we're talking Verizon, they can see all the websites you've clicked on. They can see how much time you spent on them. They can sell that information to advertisers. If you're using a VPN, you take away that ability.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4224" target="_blank">01:10:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All your service provider sees is Cal was connected to a VPN server. I don't know what he was telling it because it's encrypted. I don't know who that server was connecting to on his behalf.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4233" target="_blank">01:10:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't know what he's doing. I have no useful data to sell to anyone else. I have no real idea about what this person is doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4241" target="_blank">01:10:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you need a VPN. If you're going to use a VPN, ExpressVPN is the best in the business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4248" target="_blank">01:10:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It works on all your devices, your phone, your laptop, your tablet. It's seamless, you just turn it on and use your internet like normal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4255" target="_blank">01:10:55.000</a></span> | <span class="t">They have servers all over the world with great bandwidth. So you're never that far from a server you can connect to. So your internet experience is fast. You don't even realize you're going through a VPN.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4264" target="_blank">01:11:04.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So you need a VPN and ExpressVPN is the company you should use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4269" target="_blank">01:11:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So visit ExpressVPN.com/deep and you will get three extra months for free. That's ExpressVPN.com/deep to get three extra months for free from the number one rated VPN.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4290" target="_blank">01:11:30.000</a></span> | <span class="t">All right. Well, like we do each month, I like to talk about the books I read in the previous month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4299" target="_blank">01:11:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">As longtime listeners know, my goal is to try to read at least five books a month.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4303" target="_blank">01:11:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I do this by just regularly putting aside time to read. I read in the morning. I often will put aside time in the evening to read.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4310" target="_blank">01:11:50.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If I have extra time during lunch, I'll read occasionally. I'll time block blocks to read if I'm getting close to finishing a book.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4316" target="_blank">01:11:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But just a little bit of effort put into bringing up time to look at the pages of a book and a commitment to not instead dedicating that time to your phone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4326" target="_blank">01:12:06.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's surprising how many pages you can actually get through. All right. So, Jesse, I want to go through the five books I read.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4333" target="_blank">01:12:13.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In November of 2022.

Number one, Life is Hard. How Philosophy Can Help Us Find Our Way by Kieran Setia.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4353" target="_blank">01:12:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Kieran wrote Midlife, which I loved and I talk about a lot in my book, Digital Minimalism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CIqoE7eMmY&t=4359" target="_blank">01:12:39.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's a philosopher at MIT.
