Bank of America's lineup is pretty interesting and it was incredibly interesting before the launch of the US Bank Smartly card and the Robinhood card. And I'll say for a couple reasons, it's maybe still interesting. And if you look at any Bank of America card on face value, it's probably not gonna be that exciting.</p><p>And it becomes exciting with their preferred rewards program. They have a gold tier, a platinum tier, a platinum honors tier, and a diamond tier. And the reason that gets interesting is because whatever you earn on your credit card gets multiplied based on the tier you have. And so if you have $20,000 of combined balance across your accounts at Bank of America, which includes any accounts you have at Merrill, their partner brokerage firm, you get a increase of 25% of the points.</p><p>If you have over $50,000, then you qualify for the platinum tier and you get a 50% boost. And then at platinum honors, you get a 75% boost. And then at the diamond tier, you actually get no extra benefits on your credit card. So I don't know why that tier would be interesting to anyone.</p><p>I've never heard of anyone in the points world talk about it.</p></div></div></body></html>
