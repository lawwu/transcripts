Thank you for your ministry and for letting so many people benefit from all of the free resources at the site.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=25" target="_blank">00:00:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Pastor John, my APJ question for you is this. I deeply love my husband and I am deeply grateful to God for lending him to me as my husband during this earthly life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=37" target="_blank">00:00:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But I don't want to make him an idol in my life. What are some certain signs that I have made him an idol in my life and in my personal security?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=45" target="_blank">00:00:45.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And how can I love more and more my husband without finding my satisfaction in this relationship rather than in my relationship with God?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Valerie's own words are pretty amazing in the right direction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.000</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I haven't heard a lot of women use this language when she says, "I deeply, I'm deeply grateful to God for lending him to me as my husband during this earthly life."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=77" target="_blank">00:01:17.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a huge step in answering her own question. My husband is not mine. He belongs to the Lord.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He is on loan to me for this life. And then it's over because in the age to come, Jesus says, there is no marriage or giving in marriage in the resurrection.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, my goodness, Valerie has her ducks in a row theologically, it seems to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But she is very wise, I think, to ask the question and to think in terms of idolatry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=117" target="_blank">00:01:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">We all should. And ask what the symptoms of it might look like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=123" target="_blank">00:02:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, let me say a word about idolatry and then just give three simple ways that she and I, we all can be vigilant against idolatry in relation to our spouse or, for that matter, anybody we care about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=143" target="_blank">00:02:23.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The very last words of the letter of 1 John are these, "Little children, keep yourselves from idols." 1 John 5, 21.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the reason I mention it is because it is so striking. And the reason it's so striking is that John hasn't said one word about idolatry in this letter.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">He's never mentioned the word idol. He's never mentioned the word idolatry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And he, out of the blue, just kind of slaps you in the face like, "What? Why are you talking about idolatry suddenly in your very last sentence?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, my conclusion from that shock is, I suppose he has been talking about idolatry without using the words, and we should go back and reread and find out what idolatry looks like in 1 John.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=206" target="_blank">00:03:26.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And when I do that, the passage that sounds most like that warning is 2 John 2, 15. It goes like this, "Do not love the world or the things of the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=220" target="_blank">00:03:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the desire of the flesh, the desires of the eyes, the pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=231" target="_blank">00:03:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever. So, little children, keep yourselves from idols."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=243" target="_blank">00:04:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, he says not to love the world, but then in the very next verse, he explains that he means not loving the world the way the world loves the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">"The desires of the flesh, the desires of the eyes, the pride of life is not from the Father, but from the world, and the world with its desires is passing away."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=272" target="_blank">00:04:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't have those. Don't have a love for the world that is like the world's love for the world, that is like the world's desire for the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the issue is not simply loving the world, delighting in the world, enjoying the world, being thankful for the world, but rather loving the world the way the world loved the world, which is idolatry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=296" target="_blank">00:04:56.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, when it comes to a husband or a wife, she's asking about a husband, the issue is not merely, "May I love my husband? May I enjoy my husband? May I cherish my husband?"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=308" target="_blank">00:05:08.000</a></span> | <span class="t">The issue is, do we love them, enjoy them, cherish them the way the world does or the way a spirit-filled Christian does?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=319" target="_blank">00:05:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, here are my three suggestions for how Valerie can stay vigilant against idolatry in relation to her husband, how she can know she's not loving the way the world loves.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=338" target="_blank">00:05:38.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Number one, does the thought, the real prospect of losing him produce debilitating anxiety?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, no wife wants to lose her husband. Therefore, the thought of losing him should be a negative thought, a painful thought.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=357" target="_blank">00:05:57.000</a></span> | <span class="t">But what I mean by debilitating anxiety is the kind of worry or fretfulness or fear that undermines a wife's faith or keeps her from joyfully doing the ministry God has called her to do in the home, in the church, in the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=379" target="_blank">00:06:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">If the prospect of losing a husband produces that kind of debilitating, immobilizing anxiety, alarm bells should go off that he may be becoming an idol in the place of the God who is our peace and our security and our hope and our joy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=400" target="_blank">00:06:40.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's number one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=403" target="_blank">00:06:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Number two, does your affection for and delight in your husband detract from or diminish your delight in the Word of God and the people of God and the service of God?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=420" target="_blank">00:07:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Or does your affection for him, your enjoyment of him, in fact deepen and intensify your love for Christ, your enjoyment of his Word, your engagement with his people?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=435" target="_blank">00:07:15.000</a></span> | <span class="t">In other words, the first suggestion asks, what are the effects of losing your husband?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=440" target="_blank">00:07:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And the second suggestion asks, what are the effects of the ongoing presence of and enjoyment of your husband?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Jesus says, "Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think he would say, "Whoever loves husband or wife more than me is not worthy of me."</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can measure the superiority of our affection for Jesus both by what would happen if we lost our best earthly beloved and what happens while we enjoy our best earthly beloved.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=479" target="_blank">00:07:59.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And lastly, number three, is your relationship with your husband regulated by the Word of God?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I'm not so much talking here primarily how well you succeed in regulating your relation on the basis of Scripture,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=499" target="_blank">00:08:19.000</a></span> | <span class="t">but is it your heart's desire that you bring the entire relationship under the Word of God and measure the beauty of it and the success of it by God's standards in the Bible,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=517" target="_blank">00:08:37.000</a></span> | <span class="t">not the world standards, not your own independent standards?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=521" target="_blank">00:08:41.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And a good sign that we are moving toward idolatry is when we neglect the Word of God and decide that we're going to define the meaning of love,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=533" target="_blank">00:08:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and we're going to define the meaning of faithfulness, and we're going to define the meaning of a good relationship on our own terms,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=540" target="_blank">00:09:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or we're going to get it from books we read or movies we watch, but we're not going to—we're going to pour over the Scriptures pleading with God to shape our relationship by all of His revealed truth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=556" target="_blank">00:09:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, my three suggestions in answer to the question, "What are some signs that I am making him an idol?" would be,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=565" target="_blank">00:09:25.000</a></span> | <span class="t">number one, does the thought of losing him produce debilitating anxiety?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=571" target="_blank">00:09:31.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Two, does your affection for him diminish or intensify your affections for Jesus and your engagement with His people?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=583" target="_blank">00:09:43.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And three, is your relationship regulated by the Word of God or by your own independent ideas or the ideas of the world?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Happy the husband, happy the wife, whose love for each other is secondary to their love for Christ.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=603" target="_blank">00:10:03.000</a></span> | <span class="t">When we love Him more, we love each other better.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=609" target="_blank">00:10:09.000</a></span> | <span class="t">That's a great and profound slogan to end with, true of all of our human relationships.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Thank you, Pastor John.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPkBpEb9ks&t=615"
