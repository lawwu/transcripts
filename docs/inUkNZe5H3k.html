psychiatry at the University of Arizona,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=24" target="_blank">00:00:24.020</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">00:00:27.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Today, we discuss the neuroscience of attachment and loss, and why grief literally feels painful in our bodies.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=33" target="_blank">00:00:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">We also discuss the very real and serious health risks to being in a state of grief.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=38" target="_blank">00:00:38.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Throughout the episode, we discuss ways to navigate and recover from grief,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=41" target="_blank">00:00:41.800</a></span> | <span class="t">either from the death of a person, the death of an animal, or from the loss of a relationship, job, or other role in our lives.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.820</a></span> | <span class="t">As you'll soon learn, Dr. O'Connor's research is both fascinating and incredibly surprising.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.320</a></span> | <span class="t">She discovered, for instance, that grief is best understood through the lens of human attachment,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=58" target="_blank">00:00:58.740</a></span> | <span class="t">and that dopamine, a molecule that we normally hear about in the context of motivation and pleasure,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=63" target="_blank">00:01:03.700</a></span> | <span class="t">creates a sense of yearning that is central to the grieving process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=67" target="_blank">00:01:07.500</a></span> | <span class="t">She explains it to effectively move through grief.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=69" target="_blank">00:01:09.800</a></span> | <span class="t">We have to work with both our feelings of protest and our feelings of despair.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=74" target="_blank">00:01:14.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Those two things, the feelings of protest, that we refuse to let go, or our mind and body just don't want to let go,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=80" target="_blank">00:01:20.800</a></span> | <span class="t">as well as the feelings of despair, that we don't know what to do, that we feel like it's an endless sense of loss.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=85" target="_blank">00:01:25.900</a></span> | <span class="t">Both of those feelings have to be acknowledged, and then we have to transmute those feelings</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=90" target="_blank">00:01:30.520</a></span> | <span class="t">into actions and feelings that maintain the memory of the person or role that we played in an active way,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.940</a></span> | <span class="t">and yet move forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=98" target="_blank">00:01:38.500</a></span> | <span class="t">By the end of today's conversation, you'll have a much deeper understanding of grief,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=102" target="_blank">00:01:42.740</a></span> | <span class="t">something that everyone goes through at some point in their lives, not just as an emotion,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=107" target="_blank">00:01:47.120</a></span> | <span class="t">but as a specific psychological and physiological process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.800</a></span> | <span class="t">The idea is not to intellectualize grief, but rather to better equip you to deal with it in more direct ways,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=116" target="_blank">00:01:56.700</a></span> | <span class="t">so you can honor the loss more completely and be able to move forward, having grown from the experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=122" target="_blank">00:02:02.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=127" target="_blank">00:02:07.260</a></span> | <span class="t">It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information about science</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=132" target="_blank">00:02:12.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and science-related tools to the general public.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.680</a></span> | <span class="t">In keeping with that theme, this episode does include sponsors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And now for my discussion with Dr. Mary Frances O'Connor.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=141" target="_blank">00:02:21.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Dr. Mary Frances O'Connor, welcome.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.540</a></span> | <span class="t">It's so lovely to be here.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=146" target="_blank">00:02:26.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm a huge fan of your work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=148" target="_blank">00:02:28.320</a></span> | <span class="t">It's such important work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=150" target="_blank">00:02:30.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Everybody grieves at some point.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=153" target="_blank">00:02:33.100</a></span> | <span class="t">No one is immune from this process that we call grieving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And we get very mixed messages from a young age all the way up to adulthood about how best to grieve,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.640</a></span> | <span class="t">what grieving is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And your work has really highlighted that this is a process that doesn't always play out the same way for everybody.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.760</a></span> | <span class="t">But if we were to try and drill into some of the core elements of grief, not to be overly reductionist,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=182" target="_blank">00:03:02.480</a></span> | <span class="t">but just, you know, if you could highlight for us what grief really is as a process,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.860</a></span> | <span class="t">what some of the hallmarks of grief are, perhaps some things that everyone experiences that they shouldn't be shocked at.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And then we can leave into what your research has taught us about grief.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Perfect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.760</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's good to understand that grief is the natural response to loss.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It is a natural, physical, emotional, mental, just reaction to the death of someone very close to us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it can be helpful for people in unwinding some of these myths to think about the idea that there's a difference between grief and grieving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.040</a></span> | <span class="t">So grief is that in that moment, you know, I could say, Andrew, on a scale of one to 10, how much grief are you feeling right now?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And you would be able to tell me right now during this wave of grief how you're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But grieving is the way that grief changes over time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.600</a></span> | <span class="t">As you were saying, it's the process part.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=253" target="_blank">00:04:13.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think of it as sort of, you know, you can imagine the stock market, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=259" target="_blank">00:04:19.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Each day it's up, it's down, it's up, it's down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=261" target="_blank">00:04:21.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Some days it's really down.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Some days it's really up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.680</a></span> | <span class="t">But at the end of the year, you can still see that there's been a trajectory, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">For the year, the stock market might actually be up, even though you had some really terrible days.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=276" target="_blank">00:04:36.920</a></span> | <span class="t">I think knowing that helps us to see that grief will never go away because it is a human emotion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=287" target="_blank">00:04:47.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Whenever we're aware, whenever we remember that our loved one is gone, we're going to have a wave of grief.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=295" target="_blank">00:04:55.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's okay 25 years later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=297" target="_blank">00:04:57.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But it doesn't mean that there hasn't been a process of grieving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I think of grieving as a form of learning, learning how to live with the loss of this

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=573" target="_blank">00:09:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">First of all, great therapy provides a great rapport with somebody that you can trust and talk to about any and all issues with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=580" target="_blank">00:09:40.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Second of all, great therapy provides support in the form of emotional support or directed guidance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=585" target="_blank">00:09:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">And third, expert therapy can provide useful insights.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=588" target="_blank">00:09:48.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Sometimes those come from the

yourself in the course of therapy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=592" target="_blank">00:09:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And sometimes you arrive at those insights together.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=595" target="_blank">00:09:55.120</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=629" target="_blank">00:10:29.500</a></span> | <span class="t">From what I understand about the research on stress, so much of our ability to tolerate stress is knowing that it has a defined endpoint.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=640" target="_blank">00:10:40.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So if we look at or if you look at from the perspective of your clinical work, because you were indeed a clinical psychologist as well as a researcher, a psychologist slash neuroscientist, you wear many hats.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=655" target="_blank">00:10:55.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Is there any evidence, like what are the data on people that have some time to anticipate the loss of someone or a pet or maybe even a certain aspect of life like a job?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=667" target="_blank">00:11:07.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.060</a></span> | <span class="t">Like they've been laid off, but they get some time before their final day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=670" target="_blank">00:11:10.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Or retirement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=671" target="_blank">00:11:11.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Or retirement or somebody is slowly dying versus a sudden death, a shock, a car accident or worse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=682" target="_blank">00:11:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">What do the data tell us about how that grief is handled?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=686" target="_blank">00:11:26.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Is it easier in some sense when you know there's an endpoint because you can anticipate the end?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=693" target="_blank">00:11:33.460</a></span> | <span class="t">What's known about this?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.940</a></span> | <span class="t">I think there's a couple things there that I highlight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=699" target="_blank">00:11:39.220</a></span> | <span class="t">We can think about something being stressful and we can think about grieving for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=706" target="_blank">00:11:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">And those might be slightly different, but we can get there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">But what I would say most directly to your question is, yes, it is true that sudden losses are harder for us to learn, to understand what's happened.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=720" target="_blank">00:12:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Because we don't even have sort of a conscious, you know, we've never run the scenario sort of through our mind.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=729" target="_blank">00:12:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So, of course, it's more difficult for us to now imagine it, but there's something, there's more to it than that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we do know, for example, having closure conversations with someone who's in hospice care, these are helpful, actually, after the loss, because we can reflect on getting to say, I love you and thank you and I forgive you, please forgive me, to say goodbye.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.960</a></span> | <span class="t">We know that having that conscious process is helpful later on as we're reflecting on the loss.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But I will say that it doesn't necessarily change the attachment biology.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.400</a></span> | <span class="t">So, the attachment is an implicit belief.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=771" target="_blank">00:12:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">It is an everlasting belief.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=776" target="_blank">00:12:56.440</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, I think it is actively trying to prevent us from learning that they are gone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=782" target="_blank">00:13:02.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, what you see is a person, this will happen in studies, I ask a participant, you know, tell me about the death of your loved one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And they'll tell me the story of how they were, you know, in palliative care and they

challenges getting through the grief process because of a kind of deliberate refusal to enter this new reality that they're both gone and that there are elements of them that are still alive within us, as you pointed out, in the form of the attachment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.500</a></span> |

Ghost, I think that was the movie, right, where she loses her spouse or a loved one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=934"

on the one hand, they give people the sense that the person they miss and are so attached to is still there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, that's a movie where they could actually write in the image of the person and create some complications.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=957" target="_blank">00:15:57.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So do people

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=976" target="_blank">00:16:16.880</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the question is askew in the sense that there is no letting go of the

right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=1036" target="_blank">00:17:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Intercessory prayers in

had this way of understanding this internal relationship that is so real, you could put it on film.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=1049" target="_blank">00:17:29.420</a></span> | <span class="t">It is really happening.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

don't think of it as letting go, I think of it as integration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=1066" target="_blank">00:17:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">When I think about those things, I think, what is my relationship?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

it meant was we learned to live in this state of sort of waiting for the second shoe to drop.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=1113" target="_blank">00:18:33.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think because of that, I just became really comfortable and familiar with grief.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=1836" target="_blank">00:30:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And by overriding them, they either pare down the number of receptors or mess with the affinity of the receptors in such a way that it really does narrow our what's rewarding to only this drug.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=1851" target="_blank">00:30:51.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Because only this drug can powerfully overfill those receptors.</span></div><div

lot of crying and a lot of leaning on shoulders.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=1981" target="_blank">00:33:01.860</a></span> | <span

emotions without a lot of modeling, without a lot of philosophical understanding of what's going on, and disconnected often from their families of origin because those don't make sense to us right now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2040" target="_blank">00:34:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not suggesting that we go

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2050" target="_blank">00:34:10.220</a></span> | <span class="t">What I'm suggesting is anyone who has attachment.</span></div><div class="c"><span

there is loss, when that attachment figure is missing and deceased, it is something our brain, our body, our mind is going to react to intensely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2084" target="_blank">00:34:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And without some way of understanding what is that supposed to look like and how do

it means, so John Bowlby, who really developed this theory of attachment, right, when he was looking at infants and colleagues of his were looking at animals, right, you see these invisible tethers, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2109" target="_blank">00:35:09.560</a></span> | <span class="t">You think of, you know, think

neurobiology of dopamine and oxytocin and cortisol and adrenaline and in specific brain regions with receptors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2139" target="_blank">00:35:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Those tethers are what are keeping us searching for mom or for baby or for spouse,

without any way of understanding this, all we know is we're having these intense emotions, reactions, behaviors, thoughts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2160" target="_blank">00:36:00.420</a></span> | <span class="t">And John Bowlby divided the types of reactions that we see into two, protest and

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2528" target="_blank">00:42:08.820</a></span> | <span class="t">When we aren't doing that on a consistent basis, everything suffers, and when we are

soft that mattress is, how firm it is, how breathable it is all play into how well you'll sleep, how much deep sleep you get, how much rapid eye movement sleep, and it needs to be tailored to your unique sleep needs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2554" target="_blank">00:42:34.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, if you go to the Helix website, you can take a brief two-minute quiz, and it will ask you questions such as do you sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach, do you tend to run hot or cold during the night, things of that sort.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2563" target="_blank">00:42:43.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you know

world also to grieve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2762" target="_blank">00:46:02.080</a></span> | <span

how to go to protest and when to despair, to transmute.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2769" target="_blank">00:46:09.540</a></span>

there is even some proof of that, or I think of it as proof in the following way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2778" target="_blank">00:46:18.320</a></span> | <span class="t">So you are correct that the no-go, it's not that there's no cost with no-go.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2784" target="_blank">00:46:24.540</a></span> | <span class="t">You are correct.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2785" target="_blank">00:46:25.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So it does stop us from the type of go, which is searching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2791" target="_blank">00:46:31.180</a></span> | <span class="t">Right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2792" target="_blank">00:46:32.100</a></span> | <span class="t">So it stops maybe the cortisol or the adrenaline or something like that, but it comes with its own, I think, largely things like inflammation and things that enable the withdrawal, right, probably shifting hormones.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2811" target="_blank">00:46:51.100</a></span> | <span class="t">We know prolactin changes in grieving, oxytocin changes in grieving, but think about it this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2816" target="_blank">00:46:56.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So in a sort of evolutionary way, if your mate is gone or your caregiver is gone, that withdrawal allows you to save resources because you don't know when they're coming back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2832" target="_blank">00:47:12.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's important for your survival, but a transition through, oh, eventually I'm going to have to get my own food.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2842" target="_blank">00:47:22.540</a></span> | <span

class="t">But not in the frantic searching way, I'm going to have to find meaningful activity to go on, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2853" target="_blank">00:47:33.820</a></span> | <span class="t">So here is my theoretical reason why I believe we are set up to grieve.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2863" target="_blank">00:47:43.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I know that you had attachment figures as a child because you survived to adulthood, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2872" target="_blank">00:47:52.200</a></span> | <span class="t">Proof.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2872" target="_blank">00:47:52.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Proof that someone loved you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2874" target="_blank">00:47:54.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, children have caregivers as their primary attachment figures.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2882" target="_blank">00:48:02.980</a></span> | <span class="t">But now in your life, it is most likely that your primary attachment figure is a peer, like a spouse or boyfriend, girlfriend, etc., not your parent.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2896" target="_blank">00:48:16.760</a></span> | <span class="t">So something had to change, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2900" target="_blank">00:48:20.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And developmentally, we are prepared.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2905" target="_blank">00:48:25.040</a></span> | <span class="t">We come into the world prepared with a neurobiological developmental program that at some point says,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2911" target="_blank">00:48:31.580</a></span> | <span class="t">my parent is no longer the peak of my attachment hierarchy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2917" target="_blank">00:48:37.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm looking around, I'm motivated to see friends, and I'm motivated to date, and I'm motivated to create these enduring relationships with people my own age.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2929" target="_blank">00:48:49.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And that means that our attachment hierarchy can shift, that we have the capacity in our neurobiology, in our hormones, to shift from a primary attachment to a parent to a primary attachment to someone else.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2945" target="_blank">00:49:05.800</a></span> | <span class="t">And the capacity to do that is innate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2950" target="_blank">00:49:10.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, I will say, of course, we are all programmed to do this at roughly the same period of our life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2957" target="_blank">00:49:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Parents know, coming into the bargain, that this is going to happen, although parents experience a lot of grief during the empty nest when it is actually occurring.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2967" target="_blank">00:49:27.220</a></span> | <span class="t">When a loved one dies in, you know, a dear friend, 50 years old, her husband dies of a sudden heart attack right in front of her in the living room.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2979" target="_blank">00:49:39.260</a></span> | <span class="t">There's not a whole cohort of you going through this experience together, of transitioning to a different attachment hierarchy, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=2988" target="_blank">00:49:48.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And we set up whole cultures around sending kids to college or sending them on a mission or sending them through basic training as a way to get this whole cohort, you know, of young people through this transitional period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3000" target="_blank">00:50:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">What we need is support for these individuals who are dealing with the death of a sibling or a parent or a spouse or a child who are all going through it on their own and trying to figure it out without that infrastructure to support them, to help them understand what is natural and normal during grieving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3024" target="_blank">00:50:24.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And because we know it is a medically risky time, much like college is a medically risky time in other ways, because it is a medically risky time, we need to be able to assess what's going on with them physiologically and make sure we're supporting their grieving body through this intensely, intensely stressful experience of transmuting.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3047" target="_blank">00:50:47.560</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. And I don't know if I'm using that term correctly, but, and I can't say I'm the biggest Alan Watts fan that ever lived. I like some of his stuff, not others, but I've heard two things from him. One about transmutation, which I thought was beautiful and very apt. And from the perspective of neuroscience made a lot of sense because people talk about energy in the kind of new agey, whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3069" target="_blank">00:51:09.400</a></span> | <span class="t">crystals and crystals and yeah. Or even just the, the, the sort of non-scientific notion of, of energy tends to be rather vague. Yeah. And at the same time, it's more intuitive for most people. Yeah. Um, whereas neuroscientists love to talk about neurochemical energy or physiologist caloric energy. Yeah. But when I think about the energy that we're talking about, I think about it more as like neural circuit energy, like which, which pathway, the go pathway or the no-go pathway, um, kind of requires our attention in order to move through this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3097" target="_blank">00:51:37.640</a></span> | <span class="t">In the same way that kids learn action generation and they learn to sit still during a lesson. Yeah. Some, some more slowly like myself than others. Um, you know, I, I blame my Y chromosome for that because there's a known delay in the maturation of the prefrontal cortex in those with Y chromosomes. Um, it eventually catches up in most, but not all, um, Y chromosome possessing individuals, a different podcast for another time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3124" target="_blank">00:52:04.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I am very struck by this idea that, uh, when an attachment is, um, hindered, like in grief, that having others that are there to support us is extremely important, especially nowadays in this crisis of isolation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3140" target="_blank">00:52:20.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah. Um, and in this time where we can communicate about our experience, we can learn so much about others' experiences, but we often don't have the fundamentals of support, like, um, uh, touch.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3152" target="_blank">00:52:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Mm-hmm.

grief?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3254" target="_blank">00:54:14.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I think for some people it's, like, I think we've all heard that the ultimate stressor is the loss of a child.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3262"

target="_blank">00:54:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Um, and I can only think of one thing that might be equally stressful, if not more stressful, would be not knowing if your child is alive or dead.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3272" target="_blank">00:54:32.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

agony.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3275" target="_blank">00:54:35.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div

different than a bereavement group for someone who's really, truly mourning the, the, um, I don't know, the separation from a spouse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3287" target="_blank">00:54:47.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Mm-hmm.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

support for grieving?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3309" target="_blank">00:55:09.880</a></span> | <span

recent, um, movement that we might call the, the public health model of bereavement support.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3320" target="_blank">00:55:20.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, the idea here is that, and this largely comes out of Europe, Canada, Australia, where they're trying to actually develop health care around bereavement.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3332" target="_blank">00:55:32.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Part of this is because we can talk about how we know that the physical cost of the loss of a loved one is so impactful on us, it can lead to dying of a heart attack, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3348" target="_blank">00:55:48.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we know that, for example, the day that a loved one dies, you are 21 times more likely to have a heart attack than any other day of your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3358"

target="_blank">00:56:00.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And we know that in the first three months after the death of his wife, a man is nearly twice as likely to have a fatal heart attack compared to a man who remains married during that same time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3373" target="_blank">00:56:13.320</a></span> |

other support?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3374" target="_blank">00:56:14.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes.</span></div><div

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3377" target="_blank">00:56:17.760</a></span> | <span class="t">For women, it's about 1.8 times.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3380" target="_blank">00:56:20.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So, still, just an astronomical number for medical risk.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3384" target="_blank">00:56:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So, what we know is this period of transformation is incredibly risky, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3392" target="_blank">00:56:32.000</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we can have all this physiological change, but if, if our body isn't resilient enough, where it actually breaks during that time, this is something we need to get ahead of.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3404" target="_blank">00:56:44.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, thinking about this public

think of, in a grief literacy kind of way, what can I expect?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3417"

even just to get that, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3435" target="_blank">00:57:15.240</a></span> | <span class="t">Even

class="t">Absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3540" target="_blank">00:59:00.080</a></span> | <span class="t">I think people really underestimate this thing about smell because it's operating at an unconscious level all the time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3546" target="_blank">00:59:06.840</a></span> | <span class="t">We're like bathing in somebody else's chemicals and then they're gone and then it starts dissipating.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3552" target="_blank">00:59:12.640</a></span> | <span class="t">That's right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3552" target="_blank">00:59:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But it's still there for a while.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3553" target="_blank">00:59:13.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Absolutely.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3555" target="_blank">00:59:15.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So I think recognizing your grieving body has to figure out how to regulate again is one reason why support is so important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3566" target="_blank">00:59:26.960</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a study of, we were talking about earlier before the podcast started, there's a study of primates where, you know, as with other primates, there's a lot of infant mortality.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3583" target="_blank">00:59:43.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And in this observational study, there are troops that are being observed by scientists.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3589" target="_blank">00:59:49.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And with the death of an infant primate, the mother will often carry that deceased infant, that baby monkey, for a long time after their death and spend a lot of time looking at the infant.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3605" target="_blank">01:00:05.720</a></span> | <span class="t">The mother doesn't groom, she doesn't try to nurse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3608" target="_blank">01:00:08.200</a></span> | <span class="t">She's not confused that the infant is alive.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3611" target="_blank">01:00:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">But what is interesting is she stops grooming herself during this time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3616" target="_blank">01:00:16.360</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, that's actually medically risky for a primate because we know that grooming is so important to their health to get rid of parasites and such.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3625" target="_blank">01:00:25.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And, you know, usually in these troops, there's a really strict hierarchy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3628" target="_blank">01:00:28.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Who gets to groom who is, you know, the latest Kardashian show kind of thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3632" target="_blank">01:00:32.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And during this time, when the mother is trying to understand what's happened to this infant, the rules go out the window.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3641" target="_blank">01:00:41.700</a></span> | <span class="t">Any member of the troop can groom this mother.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3645" target="_blank">01:00:45.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, at some point, wide individual variation in how long the mother holds this infant, from days to months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3654" target="_blank">01:00:54.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Once she relinquishes the infant, the rules go back into effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3661" target="_blank">01:01:01.120</a></span> | <span class="t">So she goes back to the troop and now she participates in social life, in medical social life, in the way that she did before.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3670" target="_blank">01:01:10.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the analogy here, in addition to every time I think about it, it just rips my heart a little bit, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3677" target="_blank">01:01:17.940</a></span> | <span class="t">But the idea here is that it is all of our jobs to groom the mourning person, to care for them, to say, hey, how long has it been since you saw your doctor for your regular checkup?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3691" target="_blank">01:01:31.540</a></span> | <span class="t">How long has it been since you had your mammogram or got your teeth cleaned, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3694" target="_blank">01:01:34.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Often we've been caring for a loved one who's dying and we're neglecting our own medical care.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3699" target="_blank">01:01:39.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Because here's the thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3701" target="_blank">01:01:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Grief is the natural response.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3705" target="_blank">01:01:45.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Our bodies are resilient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3707" target="_blank">01:01:47.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Many people are shocked by how much pain, physical pain, how they get a lump in their throat or they feel like their chest is on fire when they're grieving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3718" target="_blank">01:01:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">But actually our bodies are remarkably resilient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3722" target="_blank">01:02:02.360</a></span> | <span class="t">We do learn to re-regulate without this external pacemaker.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3726" target="_blank">01:02:06.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But in those instances where the body isn't resilient enough to be able to do that, we need people around us supporting us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3735" target="_blank">01:02:15.700</a></span> | <span class="t">In a study in my own lab, we thought, well, probably this risk for a broken heart, this risk of dying of a heart attack, isn't, you know, 24-7 equally risky.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3747" target="_blank">01:02:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So we brought people into the lab and had them experience a wave of grief while they were hooked up to ECG and blood pressure and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3755" target="_blank">01:02:35.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we saw was everybody's blood pressure goes up during a wave of grief.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3761" target="_blank">01:02:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">That's probably not too surprising.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3763" target="_blank">01:02:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">But what we saw was the people who, when they walked in the door, told us they were having the most intense grief, their blood pressure went up the most.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3775" target="_blank">01:02:55.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And then in a replication study in Germany, we saw that their blood pressure didn't recover.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3780" target="_blank">01:03:00.780</a></span> | <span class="t">So you can see that these waves of grief that our body and our mind and our brain have to learn how to cope with and then eventually to adapt to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3796" target="_blank">01:03:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">Those require a physical body that can sustain that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3799" target="_blank">01:03:19.940</a></span> | <span class="t">They require relationships that can support us and sustain that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3804" target="_blank">01:03:24.940</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is why I think support is so important, even though it doesn't take away the pain of missing your person, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3813" target="_blank">01:03:33.320</a></span> | <span class="t">Because we need every resource we can muster in the midst of this moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3818" target="_blank">01:03:38.760</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, it does also mean that as much as we are missing our person and it feels so isolating to try and explain that there's a hole in the room when no one else can see that hole,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3833" target="_blank">01:03:53.380</a></span> | <span class="t">it does help at some level to talk to this other person who is seeing a different hole in the room who's also going through grief because we recognize grieving is a human experience.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3848" target="_blank">01:04:08.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And that you're not connected because you both missed the same person, but you are connected because you're both missing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3855" target="_blank">01:04:15.820</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think that bereavement support can be incredibly helpful to connect with others who are going through this same process.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3864" target="_blank">01:04:24.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And frankly, you know, I don't recommend and some bereavement support groups actually prohibit dating relationships from a grief support group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3875" target="_blank">01:04:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">But the reality is the people that we connect with are also people potentially that we develop stronger attachment bonds with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3886" target="_blank">01:04:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">That's how community works, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3889" target="_blank">01:04:49.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I think bereavement support can be incredibly important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3894" target="_blank">01:04:54.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We do know for the one out of 10 who develop disordered grieving, who really are not showing any changes over time, even though time is passing,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3910" target="_blank">01:05:10.900</a></span> | <span class="t">those people might need a very specific evidence-based psychotherapy intervention because we know that those psychology interventions can get us back on a normal or typical grieving trajectory.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3926" target="_blank">01:05:26.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I want to talk about the somatic, the bodily aspect of this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3931" target="_blank">01:05:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">We've been talking about the brain, which of course is connected to the body and vice versa.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3934" target="_blank">01:05:34.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But before I do that, I want to ask you a question about alcohol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3942" target="_blank">01:05:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3943" target="_blank">01:05:43.360</a></span> | <span class="t">I did an episode about alcohol a couple years ago, and I think I got a lot of people who wanted to stop drinking to stop drinking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3951" target="_blank">01:05:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">I got some people who wanted to keep drinking, drinking a little less, and some people hate that episode and keep drinking.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3957" target="_blank">01:05:57.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And my goal with that episode was not to change anyone's behavior, just to give them information.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3961" target="_blank">01:06:01.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3962" target="_blank">01:06:02.440</a></span> | <span class="t">I will be the last person to promote drinking because we know it's basically not good for us despite the headlines that it might be.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3972" target="_blank">01:06:12.200</a></span> | <span class="t">The mere disruption in sleep and microbiome probably explains, in my opinion, about 50% of the detrimental effects.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3978" target="_blank">01:06:18.960</a></span> | <span class="t">But with that said, it is very customary in a lot of traditions that close to the death, in the very early days and stages of grieving, to actually promote alcohol use.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3991" target="_blank">01:06:31.960</a></span> | <span class="t">And if I take an open-minded perspective to this, we know that alcohol at a low dose disinhibits us.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=3999" target="_blank">01:06:39.620</a></span> | <span class="t">It's why people start talking more.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4000" target="_blank">01:06:40.880</a></span> | <span class="t">At a higher dose, it's more of a sedative.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4004" target="_blank">01:06:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can all agree, I believe, that chronic alcohol use or continuing to drink to avoid one's feelings is just a bad idea.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4012" target="_blank">01:06:52.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Anyone that disputes that is probably drinking while they do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4015" target="_blank">01:06:55.740</a></span> | <span class="t">However, I am struck by the fact that so many traditions encourage the use of alcohol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4021" target="_blank">01:07:01.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And I wonder, based on what you told us about the risk of heart attack, whether or not this is some attempt to lower blood pressure in the short term and basically just keep the person from dying.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4031" target="_blank">01:07:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Is a drink or two, assuming you're of age and you're not an alcoholic, upon hearing the devastating news, is it the worst thing in the world?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4040" target="_blank">01:07:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">I will tell you a story, which is that, so when my mother died, she was in our very tiny hometown in Montana.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4051" target="_blank">01:07:31.060</a></span> | <span class="t">And in tiny towns, rural places like this, of course, everyone knows what's going on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4056" target="_blank">01:07:36.300</a></span> | <span class="t">So the morning after my mom died, at about one in the morning, my best friend and I went downtown to a Mexican restaurant for breakfast.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4066" target="_blank">01:07:46.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And the woman came by, who owned the place, came by the table and said, hey, I heard your mom was in the hospital.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4071" target="_blank">01:07:51.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm so sorry.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4072" target="_blank">01:07:52.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And I said, yeah, she died last night.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4075" target="_blank">01:07:55.340</a></span> | <span class="t">And she said, oh, mija, what can I get you?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4078" target="_blank">01:07:58.820</a></span> | <span

want?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4080" target="_blank">01:08:00.000</a></span> | <span class="t">And I said, can I have a

it was also the right tool that I was sitting with my best friend.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4117"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4178" target="_blank">01:09:38.920</a></span> | <span class="t">This is a piece of evidence that we have known about from huge epidemiological

target="_blank">01:09:51.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And my question is, why do we keep just proving it over and over?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4196" target="_blank">01:09:56.960</a></span> | <span class="t">What are we going to do about it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4200" target="_blank">01:10:00.180</a></span> | <span class="t">In my own lab and then replicated later in a study in Australia, we did a proof-of-concept study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4208" target="_blank">01:10:08.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, to be very, very clear, this was not a randomized clinical trial and not at a level that would be worthy of using it as medical advice.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4218" target="_blank">01:10:18.340</a></span> | <span class="t">But we said, you know, when someone dies in the ICU, in the emergency department, in hospice, in a nursing home, the person standing next to them should become our patient.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4231" target="_blank">01:10:31.300</a></span> | <span class="t">We know that their medical risk has just gone through the roof.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4236" target="_blank">01:10:36.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So we gave aspirin, a baby aspirin, to people in the first two weeks after the death of their loved one and looked at whether that was cardioprotective, which, of course, it was because we understand how aspirin works.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4250" target="_blank">01:10:50.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, the reason we need big studies is to make sure that there isn't some negative side that we would want to bar against, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4259" target="_blank">01:10:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">But my point here is, if we know that bereavement is medically risky, if we know that we need to support the grieving body so that you can even get through those days and weeks and months so that you can start to restore a life again, what are we going to do about it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4277" target="_blank">01:11:17.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I think of it this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4278" target="_blank">01:11:18.780</a></span> | <span class="t">Grief is not a disease.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4281" target="_blank">01:11:21.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Grief is totally natural.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4283" target="_blank">01:11:23.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, pregnancy is not a disease.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4287" target="_blank">01:11:27.420</a></span> | <span class="t">Pregnancy is totally natural, but no one would say it's not physiological.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4290" target="_blank">01:11:30.800</a></span> | <span class="t">No one would say there

target="_blank">01:11:36.280</a></span> | <span class="t">So that for the vast majority of people who are pregnant, they're perfectly healthy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4301" target="_blank">01:11:41.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But we have whole systems of care in place to assess whether people are healthy during this period.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4310" target="_blank">01:11:50.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And then if they're not, if we find gestational diabetes or hypertension, we know how to treat that and intervene for that person so that they can get through this transition period.</span></div><div

bereavement?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4325" target="_blank">01:12:05.340</a></span> | <span class="t">Why at our bereavement support groups do we not also take their blood pressure to find out where they're at physically in addition to teaching them the many coping skills they might use in addition to having a beer so that they can learn what grief is like and how to elicit support and ultimately how to adapt and develop a meaningful life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4349" target="_blank">01:12:29.240</a></span> | <span class="t">That includes grief, but includes all the other wonderful things in life as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4353" target="_blank">01:12:33.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

to somebody in grief, but it makes perfect sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4365" target="_blank">01:12:45.460</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4662" target="_blank">01:17:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it is helpful to remember that emotions are actually the output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4670" target="_blank">01:17:50.020</a></span> | <span class="t">They're the

to figure out how to deal with emotions, although I will come back and say that differently in a moment.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4682" target="_blank">01:18:02.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And we have to figure out how to handle what physical and mental state resulted in those emotions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4691" target="_blank">01:18:11.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So what I mean by that is if you are in a moment where everything in your body is in protest, you are amped up and you can't sit still,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4706" target="_blank">01:18:26.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And working with your body, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4710" target="_blank">01:18:30.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe you are the person who needs to go for a run every day where that hasn't really been who you were before, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4719" target="_blank">01:18:39.040</a></span> | <span class="t">On the other hand, maybe you're the person who needs to develop a yoga practice to figure out how to breathe through that amped up feeling</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4732" target="_blank">01:18:52.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And soothe yourself physically, soothe yourself, so that you can bring your heart rate down, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4742" target="_blank">01:19:02.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So those are two entirely different behaviors.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4745" target="_blank">01:19:05.560</a></span> | <span class="t">But I can tell you at the end of either of them, your body's going to be in a different state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4751" target="_blank">01:19:11.740</a></span> | <span class="t">And I bet your emotions are in a different state too, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4755" target="_blank">01:19:15.800</a></span> | <span class="t">So there's one way to think about it, which is coming at how do we handle the emotions?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4760" target="_blank">01:19:20.520</a></span> | <span class="t">But there's another way to

target="_blank">01:19:27.520</a></span> | <span class="t">When demands and resources get out of balance, that's stress.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

about it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4784" target="_blank">01:19:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">We did an intervention study

target="_blank">01:19:52.520</a></span> | <span class="t">Another arm received progressive muscle relaxation, which is sort of like learning a really fancy body scan.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4800" target="_blank">01:20:00.500</a></span> | <span class="t">You contract and relax different muscle groups in your

that feels like to really understand what relaxation feels like.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4811" target="_blank">01:20:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then there was a weightless control group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4814" target="_blank">01:20:14.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And we did it because the progressive muscle relaxation was the control group.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4819" target="_blank">01:20:19.080</a></span> | <span class="t">We thought mindfulness training would be very helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4823" target="_blank">01:20:23.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Turns out mindfulness training was helpful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4825" target="_blank">01:20:25.740</a></span> | <span class="t">But progressive muscle relaxation was even more helpful for people's grief.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4831" target="_blank">01:20:31.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So what does this practice look like?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4833" target="_blank">01:20:33.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It's a, it's a, you're tensing your fists, then relaxing, then forearms, then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

sort of guided audio to help you figure out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4853" target="_blank">01:20:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">But the important part is also feeling what, what's the difference between my clenched fist and my relaxed fist.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4860" target="_blank">01:21:00.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Oh, gosh, I didn't even realize I was, had so much muscle tension, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4865" target="_blank">01:21:05.200</a></span> | <span class="t">So what's fascinating is people told us, in any situation, I'm in the grocery store, I'm in a work meeting, I'm trying to fall asleep, I can use this tool now to help my body to get into a different state.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4882" target="_blank">01:21:22.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And that helps my grief.</span></div><div

effective, as I said.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4889" target="_blank">01:21:29.560</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think some of this is that we have, you know, grieving is a form of learning.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4893" target="_blank">01:21:33.700</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm not kidding about that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4895" target="_blank">01:21:35.160</a></span> | <span class="t">Your brain is busy while you are grieving, and it might not be the right time to take up a new practice that requires a lot of concentration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4904" target="_blank">01:21:44.420</a></span> | <span class="t">If you do mindfulness,

upshot of all that is, on the one hand, it's not that we have to deal with emotions because they are an output.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4914" target="_blank">01:21:54.680</a></span> | <span class="t">We have to deal with our demands and our resources and developing a whole toolkit of ways to think about adapting in our life now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=4925" target="_blank">01:22:05.120</a></span> | <span

physiology is below the level of consciousness, it's not like we can know how we're going to react.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=5473" target="_blank">01:31:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm choosing to do this when they

do these things because you can't.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=5507" target="_blank">01:31:47.580</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm

internal relationship can evolve with them,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=5548" target="_blank">01:32:28.340</a></span> | <span

important role because it argues against what I just talked about.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=5881"

know, hang out at the margins.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=5889" target="_blank">01:38:09.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so let's just take this face on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=5891" target="_blank">01:38:11.620</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, if somebody kills themselves by gunshot, there isn't usually a second opportunity to think, oops, I really don't want this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=5902" target="_blank">01:38:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">So what do we know about the research on suicide, if we could just start there?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=5907" target="_blank">01:38:27.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Like, do we know anything from studies of people who tried to commit suicide and were unsuccessful?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=5915" target="_blank">01:38:35.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Do we know whether or not that's a typical experience?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=5920" target="_blank">01:38:40.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And what do we know about grieving suicide that's different than grieving other forms of death?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=5926" target="_blank">01:38:46.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=5926" target="_blank">01:38:46.780</a></span> | <span class="t">I can say up front that I am not an expert in suicide.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=5932" target="_blank">01:38:52.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And there is so much that is known scientifically about the mental health surrounding suicide and suicide attempts and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=5943" target="_blank">01:39:03.240</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think about it this way.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=5945" target="_blank">01:39:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">I think we can separate out a conversation that I'm not expert in that says, you know, suicide is a permanent solution to a probably temporary problem.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=5961" target="_blank">01:39:21.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And there are lots of reasons, mental health care and so forth, that suicide may happen.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=5969" target="_blank">01:39:29.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And it is a tragedy that this permanent solution seems the only one, given what might be a temporary situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=5981" target="_blank">01:39:41.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But I can put all of that a little bit on a shelf, honestly, and still tackle something that I think you're getting at, which is, what about the person who's grieving after a suicide?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=5993" target="_blank">01:39:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think about that in this way, because we do know that grief after a sudden death, grief after a violent death, grief after an unexpected death, and all of those often describe a suicide, is more challenging.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6015" target="_blank">01:40:15.560</a></span> | <span class="t">It is more difficult to adapt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6018" target="_blank">01:40:18.360</a></span> | <span class="t">It is more difficult to restore a meaningful life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6021" target="_blank">01:40:21.820</a></span> | <span class="t">A friend of mine who used to come to the class that I teach, whose son died by suicide, helped me really see the insight into the grieving process there, though.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6033" target="_blank">01:40:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's something that actually probably applies even more broadly, but is very common in the thought patterns of people who are grieving, someone who died by suicide.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6045" target="_blank">01:40:45.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And that is what he called the would've, could've, should've thoughts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6051" target="_blank">01:40:51.420</a></span> | <span class="t">So this is, if only I would have picked up the phone.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6055" target="_blank">01:40:55.180</a></span> | <span class="t">If only I could have gotten them to the hospital sooner.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6058" target="_blank">01:40:58.220</a></span> | <span class="t">The doctor should've known to check for.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6061" target="_blank">01:41:01.400</a></span> | <span class="t">And the thing is that the brain, because it is a wonder, the brain can come up with an infinite number of stories.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6074" target="_blank">01:41:14.460</a></span> | <span class="t">An infinite number of reasons why this loss is your fault.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6080" target="_blank">01:41:20.500</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reality is, there is no way through those questions because there is an infinite number of them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6091" target="_blank">01:41:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">And what he taught me, and I think the research bears this out, is that the solution is not to find answers to an infinite number of questions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6103" target="_blank">01:41:43.620</a></span> | <span class="t">If you think about it, each of those stories, if only I would have picked up the phone, each of those stories ends in, and then my loved one would have lived.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6114" target="_blank">01:41:54.480</a></span> | <span class="t">But the reality that we're dealing with right now, today, here, in this room, is that they didn't live.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6123" target="_blank">01:42:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">And so none of those things matter anymore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6127" target="_blank">01:42:07.540</a></span> | <span class="t">Because now the question is, how do I live, given that it is true that they are gone?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6135" target="_blank">01:42:15.060</a></span> | <span class="t">It's almost like those questions are another form of this protest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6138" target="_blank">01:42:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes, that's exactly it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6140" target="_blank">01:42:20.380</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, I don't want to hold the model that we talked about earlier up on a pedestal that implies it doesn't have exceptions and nuance,

are we doing it?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6177" target="_blank">01:42:57.960</a></span> | <span

form of learning and all of this rumination, as we would call it, these perseverative thoughts, what if, if only, why are we doing it then?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

this other world in your head.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6266" target="_blank">01:44:26.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And so

we have to come to understand, these are thoughts.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6290" target="_blank">01:44:50.460</a></span> |

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6299" target="_blank">01:44:59.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And we can learn a lot of skills around how to cope with our

the solution that your friend came to around maybe they needed that,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6341" target="_blank">01:45:41.100</a></span> | <span class="t">we often have to find the story that may be true, it may not be true, but that quells the thoughts.</span></div><div class="c"><span

20-year-olds, you know, who often had a friend in high school or a grandparent or an uncle.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6411"

thank you for shedding light on, on the importance of allowing oneself to grieve it in the way that, that feels right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6443" target="_blank">01:47:23.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6443" target="_blank">01:47:23.900</a></span> | <span class="t">And that takes us back to this notion of, of taking oneself from the understandable response of protest and despair to a place of adaptive grieving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6456" target="_blank">01:47:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6458"

target="_blank">01:47:43.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's sometimes challenging on a podcast where we emphasize science and health to bring up notions of faith and religion, belief in afterlife and God and so forth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6477" target="_blank">01:47:57.440</a></span> | <span class="t">But I think we can do it in a way that's neither reducing any of that to neurons and neurochemicals because yes, there are studies of, you know, where is God in the brain and these kinds of things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6490" target="_blank">01:48:10.860</a></span> | <span class="t">But those studies always leave me personally feeling pretty underwhelmed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6494" target="_blank">01:48:14.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And that's just my own, but it's very clear that for many, many of the 8 billion plus people on this planet, they believe in something larger than the experience we can see.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6511" target="_blank">01:48:31.880</a></span> | <span class="t">They have true faith in God, Christ, Allah, whatever particular religion they happen to orient toward or some larger spirituality that's not nested in any of those things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6525" target="_blank">01:48:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6526" target="_blank">01:48:46.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And that it can provide an enormously powerful structure to their thinking around loss.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6534" target="_blank">01:48:54.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

history.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6647" target="_blank">01:50:47.760</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't need to know

can be incredibly difficult and sort of add a whole layer of stress and disruption in grieving.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6735"

process of transmutation, that there's a path.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6914" target="_blank">01:55:14.900</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, there's a path laid out should they believe in it that they can follow.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6918" target="_blank">01:55:18.660</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas for people that don't have faith, they have to find their own path.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6922" target="_blank">01:55:22.540</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the research that speaks to this that I stick with, this is an older study now, but has always been remarkable to me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6931" target="_blank">01:55:31.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And the reason that it is remarkable is it is a truly prospective bereavement study, which is incredibly rare.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6938" target="_blank">01:55:38.980</a></span> | <span class="t">So what that means, this was called the Changing Lives of Older Couples study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6943" target="_blank">01:55:43.200</a></span> | <span class="t">It was done in Michigan, funded by NIH, and it was a 10-year study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6949" target="_blank">01:55:49.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So to be accepted into the study, they looked for couples where one of the members of the couple was over 65.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6958" target="_blank">01:55:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">That was the entry criteria.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6959" target="_blank">01:55:59.780</a></span> | <span class="t">You're a couple.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6960" target="_blank">01:56:00.980</a></span> | <span class="t">One of you is over 65.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6962" target="_blank">01:56:02.380</a></span> | <span class="t">They interviewed both members of the couple about a host of different things.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6967" target="_blank">01:56:07.920</a></span> | <span class="t">And then they followed the couples for 10 years.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6971" target="_blank">01:56:11.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And when one of them died, they went back and re-interviewed the surviving spouse.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6978" target="_blank">01:56:18.240</a></span> | <span class="t">So what it means is usually when we're doing grief-related studies, we're recruiting participants into the study after the death has happened or maybe shortly before the death happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6990" target="_blank">01:56:30.540</a></span> | <span class="t">But in those cases, we know that there's going to be a death, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6993" target="_blank">01:56:33.740</a></span> | <span class="t">So this was how are people just functioning in their life and then later what happens?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=6999" target="_blank">01:56:39.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And there was a natural control sample where they re-interviewed couples where both remained alive during that time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=7006" target="_blank">01:56:46.300</a></span> | <span class="t">All of this is to say, I mean, it's a magnificentâ€”I don't think it will ever be funded again because it was such a large and long study.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=7016" target="_blank">01:56:56.660</a></span> | <span class="t">But what it allowed us to do was look at their religious beliefs, look at their understanding of life and death before anyone was sick, and then see how that predicted how they handled grief later.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=7029" target="_blank">01:57:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And what we learned from that study is, for people who had a way of understanding the role of death in life, which for many people was a religious understanding, having a religious faith, a religious belief, but for some people was more of a philosophical or even sort of agricultural cycle of life kind of understanding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=7053" target="_blank">01:57:33.060</a></span> | <span class="t">For those who had a way to understand these life and death type issues, it predicted less grief severity after the loss of this specific individual, as though having thought through some of these existential issues in advance enables us when one situation happens to kind of at least hearken back to what we believe, with the caveat that it may throw your beliefs into disarray.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=7080" target="_blank">01:58:00.700</a></span> | <span class="t">But regardâ€”in this empirical study, at least, it offered a path, just as you said.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=7086" target="_blank">01:58:06.640</a></span> | <span class="t">And so that, to me, suggests, you know, if we take it out of just the empirical finding, that maybe we ought to be thinking about these things, you know?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=7098" target="_blank">01:58:18.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Maybe we need to contemplate what happens.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=7102" target="_blank">01:58:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">How do we understand death and life and grief and illness?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=7106" target="_blank">01:58:26.520</a></span> | <span class="t">And how do we live our lives now knowing that that is a part of the future?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=7113" target="_blank">01:58:33.480</a></span> | <span class="t">I think thinking about death is incredibly useful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=7118" target="_blank">01:58:38.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=7118" target="_blank">01:58:38.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think most people are terrified to do it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=7120" target="_blank">01:58:40.480</a></span> | <span class="t">And I was for a long time.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=7121" target="_blank">01:58:41.620</a></span> | <span class="t">And then eventually enough friends of mine died.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=7123" target="_blank">01:58:43.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=7129" target="_blank">01:58:49.680</a></span> | <span class="t">So I have a couple of questions about practices specifically.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=7133" target="_blank">01:58:53.600</a></span> | <span class="t">I have this practice that I do every day, which is more or less like yoga nidra, self-directed relaxation, long exhale breathing, which sort of coined non-sleep deep rest.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

class="t">And the idea is that when people can have the loss, feelings, thoughts, behaviors, barely can make cereal, and also can have the restoration stressors they have to deal with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=7900" target="_blank">02:11:40.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't mean this as a good

have to do the taxes, and I've never done the taxes, but I got to figure it out because apparently life goes on.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

with the loss of this loved person and restoring a meaningful life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=7924"

been going to dinner with this woman who was very different from his wife, but that she brought out, like, really different parts of his personality and that he was really enjoying having dinner with him, and he was very surprised by this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=8012" target="_blank">02:13:32.040</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=8830" target="_blank">02:27:10.880</a></span> | <span class="t">And when we know loss, it takes smaller and smaller things for it to feel

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=8933" target="_blank">02:28:53.580</a></span> | <span class="t">You research this stuff in very controlled studies of humans, and you know the animal literature.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=8939" target="_blank">02:28:59.540</a></span> | <span class="t">And I marvel at your ability to pull from these different sources of scholarship, but also that you're so grounded in the clinical practice, but also in the realities of daily life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=8949" target="_blank">02:29:09.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if things get too scientific or too clinical, they can become a bit detached, and you clearly have all three.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inUkNZe5H3k&t=8956" target="_blank">02:29:16.380</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">02:29:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">And hopefully the inevitable reflections that grief also highlights the good parts of life, too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
