They're probably the first people to domesticate the horse. So they expanded the little island of the steppe that's in the Great Hungarian Plain in the Carpathian Basin.</p><p>You look at the genetic data and there's a 90% population disruption. So one of the mysteries of the Yamnaya expansion was everybody had this cognitive bias to think this is very male-driven. You look at the genetic data and you look at the Y chromosomes, which track male migration, and the mitochondrial sequences, which are more sensitive to female migration, and it looks like the steppe expansion is very both sexes.</p><p>The most likely explanation for what's happening now is that it actually is a male-biased process, but it's one that's interrupted. So the Yamnaya expansion is very male-biased. It expands to the edge of the range. They encounter the corded ware, and in fact the corded ware males absorb and take Yamnaya females, and then they expand further.</p></div></div></body></html>
