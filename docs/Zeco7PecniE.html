But it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeco7PecniE&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.440</a></span> | <span class="t">the same in both scenarios, right?

So, whether there's inflation, deflation,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeco7PecniE&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.280</a></span> | <span class="t">booms, busts, you never know. So, my only advice is, whatever you choose to invest in,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeco7PecniE&t=187" target="_blank">00:03:07.120</a></span> | <span class="t">stocks, bonds, treasuries, something else, just create a plan, stick with it, put that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeco7PecniE&t=191" target="_blank">00:03:11.080</a></span> | <span class="t">money to work. And I think you're probably going to have to do our old dollar cost averaging</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeco7PecniE&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.920</a></span> | <span class="t">thing here. That's kind of automated and rules-based. Invest on a set schedule, don't worry about</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeco7PecniE&t=199" target="_blank">00:03:19.600</a></span> | <span class="t">timing things perfectly, and just make an investment you can live with regardless of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeco7PecniE&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.240</a></span> | <span class="t">the outcome. I think that's the whole thing, is thinking in terms of process over outcomes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeco7PecniE&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.240</a></span> | <span class="t">You could make a really good investing decision and have a poor outcome over the short term</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeco7PecniE&t=211" target="_blank">00:03:31.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that you kind of regret and kick yourself about. But if you made it for the right reasons,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeco7PecniE&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.560</a></span> | <span class="t">then who cares? It's about making good decisions over and over again, and eventually you just</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeco7PecniE&t=219" target="_blank">00:03:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">want a good batting average. So, you're not going to be able to control what the markets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeco7PecniE&t=223" target="_blank">00:03:43.040</a></span> | <span class="t">are going to do, but you can control how you react to them. So, I think you just make a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeco7PecniE&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.800</a></span> | <span class="t">plan with the understanding that it's never going to be perfect, there's no optimized</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeco7PecniE&t=229" target="_blank">00:03:49.560</a></span> | <span class="t">portfolio, there's no perfect time to get in or out. I think, for a lot of investors,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeco7PecniE&t=233" target="_blank">00:03:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">perfect is usually the enemy of good.

So, just come up with something that you can live with,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeco7PecniE&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">and just do it, instead of worrying all the time. Bonds are down, stocks are down, they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeco7PecniE&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.640</a></span> | <span class="t">could go down further, but this is a pretty good entry point for someone sitting on cash</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeco7PecniE&t=249" target="_blank">00:04:09.240</a></span> | <span class="t">for 18 months.

Obviously, investing towards the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeco7PecniE&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.600</a></span> | <span class="t">bottom of the Great Depression in 1933 was a pretty good entry point, after stocks fell</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zeco7PecniE&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.620</a></span> | <span class="t">something like 85%.
