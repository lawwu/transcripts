Most English translations are close enough to one another that you can follow along as the pastor reads from whatever version. Relatively very few places where the meaning would be substantially changed by a different translation.</p><p>There are a few of those but I think even highlighting that is helpful because it motivates people to go back and consult even if they don't understand the original languages they can consult a commentary and understand why these translations are different and sometimes that brings out an important nuance of meaning.</p><p>I think it actually helps read the text critically when you notice that there are differences from translation to translation.</p></div></div></body></html>
