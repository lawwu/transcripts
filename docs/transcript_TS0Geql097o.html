I just need to chisel away the layers that are in its way. And I think dharma operates in very much the same way. I can almost guarantee for you and me and anybody who's listening right now, there is an essence that you've already been in touch with at some point in time.</p><p>It could have been when you were a little kid. It could have been last week. But you've had brushes, incidents with this essence. It may be buried under deadlines, under drop-offs, under all the other things we have going on in our lives. And we can start to kind of chisel away those layers.</p><p>One of the ways that we can do that is through good questions to kind of come back to who we are. One of the questions that I love the most is, what would you do for free? If compensation was not a factor, what is it that you would want to spend your time doing anyway?</p><p>If you can clearly answer that question, now you're starting to get closer to this thing inside of you that wants to express itself, no matter how the outside world reacts.</p></div></div></body></html>
