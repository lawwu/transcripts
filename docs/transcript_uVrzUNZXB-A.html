It's really important to give your doctor a heads up. And there's no shame in saying, "Doc, I can't afford you.</p><p>And I found a great clinic, it's JCI accredited. This is where I want to go." It may or may not be that your doctor and your destination and your foreign country would follow up. But the fact that you've given your doc notice and you brought back all of your paperwork, that's another big mistake people make is they toss their paperwork, they leave it in the hotel room.</p><p>You got to bring back your screening, your blood tests, your consultation notes, all of that. And then a doc is going to be able to pick up where your other doc left off if a complication develops or if they need to go in and do something else or have some follow up.</p></div></div></body></html>
