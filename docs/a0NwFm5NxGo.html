Think of it in a way as an AI engineering boot camp. So this talk assumes that you have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=39" target="_blank">00:00:39.800</a></span> | <span class="t">strong full-stack engineering background. You should be comfortable building modern tech from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=44" target="_blank">00:00:44.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the ground up across all of the different layers, infrastructure, database and persistence, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=48" target="_blank">00:00:48.940</a></span> | <span class="t">applications both on the back end and on the client side. However, this talk assumes zero background with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=54" target="_blank">00:00:54.840</a></span> | <span class="t">any AI or machine learning. We're going to start from scratch there. So why would you be interested</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=60" target="_blank">00:01:00.940</a></span> | <span class="t">in becoming an AI engineer? For an in-detail summary, I'd encourage you to read The Rise of the AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=66" target="_blank">00:01:06.080</a></span> | <span class="t">Engineer by Sean Swix Wang that inspired the name of this talk. One critical takeaway from this essay is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=72" target="_blank">00:01:12.320</a></span> | <span class="t">when Swix identifies that full-stack engineers can now deploy a wide variety of legitimately useful AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.480</a></span> | <span class="t">solutions by leveraging new foundational models. Previously, such solutions would have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.800</a></span> | <span class="t">required substantial experience in traditional ML techniques and costly investment in upfront data</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=89" target="_blank">00:01:29.720</a></span> | <span class="t">collection. So let's go ahead and move forward. So before we dive into the syllabus itself, I want</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.640</a></span> | <span class="t">you to follow a few techniques from the book, The Art of Learning, that this course was designed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=100" target="_blank">00:01:40.600</a></span> | <span class="t">around. This is going to make your learning more effective and efficient. First, stay focused and limit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=105" target="_blank">00:01:45.900</a></span> | <span class="t">distractions. There's a lot of low information out there with diminished returns. Stay focused on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=110" target="_blank">00:01:50.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the important topics. Speaking of important topics, we're going to invest heavily in the fundamentals in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.840</a></span> | <span class="t">this course. By understanding fundamental building blocks well, we'll be able to build sophisticated AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=120" target="_blank">00:02:00.960</a></span> | <span class="t">products through composition of those blocks. Lastly, as you go through the syllabus, use ChatGPT as a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.920</a></span> | <span class="t">private tutor. Anytime you come across a new concept, use the Socratic method with ChatGPT to unfurl the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.200</a></span> | <span class="t">topic until you understand it thoroughly. You'd be surprised how many concepts pre-date ChatGPT's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=138" target="_blank">00:02:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">January 22nd knowledge cutoff date. So regarding the syllabus itself, as we go through each section,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=144" target="_blank">00:02:24.180</a></span> | <span class="t">I'll be spending most of our limited time talking about the why. We'll summarize what you will learn and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.980</a></span> | <span class="t">why it is important. Let's go ahead and dive in. Section one, overview to large language models. Before we start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.860</a></span> | <span class="t">working with large language models, it's useful to start with a short but respectably thorough overview of what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=162" target="_blank">00:02:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">they are and how they work at a high level. Cohere is a company founded by one of the creators of the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=167" target="_blank">00:02:47.000</a></span> | <span class="t">Transformer architecture and they've got a great overview of these core concepts in their educational</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.700</a></span> | <span class="t">docs. So we'll start there. Remember, stay focused. Only review module one in its entirety and keep pairing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.680</a></span> | <span class="t">the Socratic method with ChatGPT to flesh out your knowledge as you go along. Okay, moving forward.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=185" target="_blank">00:03:05.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Section two, prompt engineering. So on its face, prompt engineering feels like a bunch</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=189" target="_blank">00:03:09.980</a></span> | <span class="t">of voodoo mumbo jumbo. It feels absurd, really, because we're used to working with symbolic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=195" target="_blank">00:03:15.180</a></span> | <span class="t">architectures based on code logic. So it's strange to imagine getting higher quality output by prompting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=201" target="_blank">00:03:21.520</a></span> | <span class="t">an AI model politely. But the language models are neural architectures. They're inspired by our brains.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.660</a></span> | <span class="t">So different techniques are required. The bottom line is that prompt engineering objectively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.340</a></span> | <span class="t">increases the quality of neural architectures output, such as language models. So now you might be tempted</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=218" target="_blank">00:03:38.840</a></span> | <span class="t">to say, all right, I'm going to skip all this prompt engineering stuff and get straight to fine tuning</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.540</a></span> | <span class="t">models. But fine tuning quality is often increased by starting with the best performing prompts and using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">those prompts in your fine tuning training data. Lastly, it's important to really sink your hands into the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.180</a></span> | <span class="t">prompt engineering clay to see what language models are capable of, and also to probe their limitations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.220</a></span> | <span class="t">So regarding course materials, start out by watching the overview video from prompt engineering guide</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">founder Elvis Cerevia, then dive directly into the guide itself. Read it cover to cover and pay special</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.940</a></span> | <span class="t">attention to the graduate job classification case study that shows how layering on prompt engineering techniques</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=257" target="_blank">00:04:17.940</a></span> | <span class="t">iteratively increases quality of output in aggregate. Next, read the learn prompting org docs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=263" target="_blank">00:04:23.940</a></span> | <span class="t">favored by open AI cover to cover. The redundant concepts in this second guide are useful to review to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=270" target="_blank">00:04:30.020</a></span> | <span class="t">really lock in these critical concepts. And also this guide does cover additional concepts as well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.140</a></span> | <span class="t">All right, moving on. Section three, open AI. Open AI does two things incredibly well. One,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=282" target="_blank">00:04:42.980</a></span> | <span class="t">they provide state of the art AI models and two, they make them incredibly accessible. By learning open AI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.060</a></span> | <span class="t">you can understand the art of what's possible today. You can also start building and experimenting with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=294" target="_blank">00:04:54.100</a></span> | <span class="t">AI engineering quickly. However, there are some practical limitations to consider that we will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=299" target="_blank">00:04:59.460</a></span> | <span class="t">address further on. So regarding course material, we're going to read the open AI docs and API reference cover</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=305" target="_blank">00:05:05.540</a></span> | <span class="t">to cover. Then I would encourage you to quickly review the practical hands-on examples in their cookbook.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=310" target="_blank">00:05:10.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Don't spend too much time there. You can come back later and we want to keep marching.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay, moving on. Section four, Langchain. Langchain is the applications framework that allows you to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.940</a></span> | <span class="t">put AI tech together in an organized and well-architected way. So it is highly maintainable,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.220</a></span> | <span class="t">modular, and scalable. So Langchain integrates all the different parts and pieces required for a modern AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">system. Models, prompts, long and short-term memory for retrieval augmented generation and conversations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=340" target="_blank">00:05:40.500</a></span> | <span class="t">practically everything. Furthermore, for any components that aren't supported yet,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Langchain is flexible enough to allow straightforward integration of these new components, including your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=349" target="_blank">00:05:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">proprietary needs. Lastly, and this is very important in the context of this syllabus, because</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=355" target="_blank">00:05:55.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Langchain is the glue layer for most everything else in the AI ecosystem, you will learn a lot about the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.140</a></span> | <span class="t">comprehensive practice of AI engineering by building a comprehensive understanding of Langchain.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=366" target="_blank">00:06:06.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Now, onto the course materials. So building AI apps is a new paradigm. There's a lot to absorb.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=373" target="_blank">00:06:13.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're going to prime you with a non-technical comprehensive executive summary by command bar.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=378" target="_blank">00:06:18.900</a></span> | <span class="t">First, then we'll follow up with a simple plain English technical guide that covers only some basic</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Langchain building blocks. So you can begin to quickly grok how a more complex AI system can be built up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=389" target="_blank">00:06:29.940</a></span> | <span class="t">modularly with this framework. So as you might imagine, the meat and potatoes of this section will be the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=395" target="_blank">00:06:35.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Langchain docs and code base.

Before we start fine-tuning black box AI models, we need a scientific</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=458" target="_blank">00:07:38.100</a></span> | <span class="t">process that can evaluate our changes iteratively. Otherwise, how do we know we're making improvements and not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=463" target="_blank">00:07:43.540</a></span> | <span class="t">regressions, right? So regarding the course materials, OpenAI has a great cookbook that walks you through</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=469" target="_blank">00:07:49.380</a></span> | <span class="t">writing some example evals. Note that the nature of AI output often means you're going to have to be a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=474" target="_blank">00:07:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">little bit creative when writing effective evals. Furthermore, OpenAI also provides a framework that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=480" target="_blank">00:08:00.580</a></span> | <span class="t">includes a robust eval suite and allows for writing your custom evals as well. Review these materials quickly.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=489" target="_blank">00:08:09.220</a></span> | <span class="t">Alright, moving on. Section six, fine-tuning. By this point, you've already gained some exposure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=494" target="_blank">00:08:14.180</a></span> | <span class="t">into fine-tuning OpenAI's models. We're going to take that further by going step-by-step through their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=498" target="_blank">00:08:18.980</a></span> | <span class="t">fine-tuning cookbook. So knowledge of how to fine-tune OpenAI models will take you a long way. However,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=504" target="_blank">00:08:24.820</a></span> | <span class="t">there are practical limitations to relying on OpenAI alone. For example, it can be cost prohibitive and you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=510" target="_blank">00:08:30.420</a></span> | <span class="t">can run into latency or rate limiting issues in production. This is in addition to standard privacy and control</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=516" target="_blank">00:08:36.100</a></span> | <span class="t">concerns. Because of this, an efficient pattern is to prototype and ship a solution quickly using OpenAI's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=522" target="_blank">00:08:42.660</a></span> | <span class="t">models, start gathering usage and training data. Then, if the solution needs to start scaling, see if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.500</a></span> | <span class="t">you can fine-tune a smaller and cheaper open-source model to match or out-compete OpenAI's model on your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0NwFm5NxGo&t=534" target="_blank">00:08:54.820</a></span> | <span class="t">target use case.
