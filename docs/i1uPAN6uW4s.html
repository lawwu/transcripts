Okay. So, yeah. We want to fully give in to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=61" target="_blank">00:01:01.480</a></span> | <span class="t">Vibes in this presentation.

So, Vibe coding in itself</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=78" target="_blank">00:01:18.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And why it has these negative connotations. It starts in this fun chaos mode. I think it's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=83" target="_blank">00:01:23.780</a></span> | <span class="t">part of the journey of what I'm presenting, looking at the clock in 13 minutes and 40 seconds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=88" target="_blank">00:01:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">is how we get to this other side of professional Zen vibes. And to break it down a bit, this initial</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=96" target="_blank">00:01:36.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Vibe coding, what you see most people do on YouTube when they work on websites and ship them to production,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=103" target="_blank">00:01:43.140</a></span> | <span class="t">and then wonder why everything is slowly falling apart and their bills go up. That's the Yolo</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=109" target="_blank">00:01:49.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Vibe coding and not meant to ship to production. It's about speed, instant gratification, there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=115" target="_blank">00:01:55.260</a></span> | <span class="t">creativity in there. And it's really about this fast learning. Hopefully I can highlight that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=119" target="_blank">00:01:59.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Then next -- and these are all made up terms. This is an ever evolving space. You can find -- if you have better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=126" target="_blank">00:02:06.900</a></span> | <span class="t">words, please bring them to me. But structured vibes brings guardrails to how these things actually act.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=133" target="_blank">00:02:13.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And if you have an LM in this first space, it will just do creative things. Guardrails added to -- enter the state of maintainability and balance it to bring you some more sustainable code in the end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=145" target="_blank">00:02:25.380</a></span> | <span class="t">Yolo vibes are not meant to be used in the long term. Structured vibes are where you bring</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=151" target="_blank">00:02:31.860</a></span> | <span class="t">actually that enterprise state in the end that somebody you feel comfortable handing it over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.660</a></span> | <span class="t">And lastly, we have the spectrum and vibes where I think most of you probably want to end up with. And that's where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=163" target="_blank">00:02:43.860</a></span> | <span class="t">vibes -- the idea of Vibe coding scales up to large code bases with scale and reliability and really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=171" target="_blank">00:02:51.460</a></span> | <span class="t">that velocity of everybody feeling the vibes and generating code, but in a generating code in a way that fits into the code base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=178" target="_blank">00:02:58.340</a></span> | <span class="t">So quick Yolo outliner. As Kaparthi termed it, it's all about the outcomes. You don't look at code. You</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=188" target="_blank">00:03:08.340</a></span> | <span class="t">iterate using language. Best even talk to the AI. Then auto accepting is really part of it. You talk to the AI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=196" target="_blank">00:03:16.820</a></span> | <span class="t">you look at what it creates, and all the rest just lands. If it ever goes wrong, you just reset everything</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.740</a></span> | <span class="t">completely. You throw out the code or you undo and you keep going. And there is a place for Yolo vibe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=209" target="_blank">00:03:29.060</a></span> | <span class="t">coding. It's not just weird weekend things. It's rapid prototyping and proof of concept. You just want to explore.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It's where creativity really shines and you can focus on the outcome. And that's the thing where</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=221" target="_blank">00:03:41.220</a></span> | <span class="t">vibe coding really shines. And while you do it, you can learn. You can try something in a rust code base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=226" target="_blank">00:03:46.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Make a rust game. Make a rust frogger. Try a different stack. Make a neon flickering rust frogger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=234" target="_blank">00:03:54.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Just -- and then look at the code in the end. Like, how do games work actually in rust? Have AI explain the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=240" target="_blank">00:04:00.340</a></span> | <span class="t">code back to you. And lastly, personal projects is where we see it most. Just over the weekend,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=246" target="_blank">00:04:06.420</a></span> | <span class="t">my kids needed an app to do X. And we build it together. And now we have an app to do X. And I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=251" target="_blank">00:04:11.300</a></span> | <span class="t">not shipping it to production. But it's my app. So we can do some demos. I think the easiest way to show it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=258" target="_blank">00:04:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">off. Just open a new VS code window. This is my insiders. If you haven't done it -- oh, I have an update</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=264" target="_blank">00:04:24.100</a></span> | <span class="t">pending. Oh, this is insider. So it's every day something new. I'm excited. But not updating now.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=268" target="_blank">00:04:28.820</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. In -- so make sure you're in agent mode, which right now isn't yet the default. We're working on that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=275" target="_blank">00:04:35.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Same problem, I guess. Auto sharing to -- don't monitor. Change.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=289" target="_blank">00:04:49.300</a></span> | <span class="t">Entire screen. Ta-da! Okay. Thank you. Yeah. So let's start with the -- don't care about the code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=301" target="_blank">00:05:01.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And one way to do this is auto-approved. If you look at chat auto-approved, it's a -- with caveats,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=309" target="_blank">00:05:09.620</a></span> | <span class="t">cool option. And you can enable it also for, for example, your workspace only. But auto-approved</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=316" target="_blank">00:05:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">allows you to avoid all these confirmation buttons that the chat otherwise annoyingly throws at you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.140</a></span> | <span class="t">while you're trying to vibe. So while we're here, let's start this -- you see this little microphone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=327" target="_blank">00:05:27.940</a></span> | <span class="t">button down here. And that is built into this code. It's actually a local model. Nothing leaves your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=333" target="_blank">00:05:33.620</a></span> | <span class="t">machine. And it's really -- it's a great way to just chat with the AI. I -- you can actually send it back</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.780</a></span> | <span class="t">that it responds everything back to you. Let's try -- let's make our first app and then go back to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=346" target="_blank">00:05:46.020</a></span> | <span class="t">slides because we want to just make copilot vibe what we ask for. So, actually, the shortcut is for me is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=353" target="_blank">00:05:53.700</a></span> | <span class="t">command I. I like that one. Let's make an app for water hydration tracking in React and Byte. It should</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=361" target="_blank">00:06:01.860</a></span> | <span class="t">use Material UI and follow nice Apple-esque design principles. So, yeah. Thank you.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=368" target="_blank">00:06:08.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. And off it goes. So, what you see now first is actually we have a create new workspace tool which</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.820</a></span> | <span class="t">let's you vibe code a little bit easier. It's -- let's do my --</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=382" target="_blank">00:06:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Is this just copilot or is this something like that?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=384" target="_blank">00:06:24.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Just copilot. Yeah. The copilot agent load. It comes with that tool. So, demo one, two, whatever.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=392" target="_blank">00:06:32.100</a></span> | <span class="t">It's vibe coding. So, we don't care about the code. But it has to be somewhere.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=397" target="_blank">00:06:37.940</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. Now, because we have the repo, our workspace, it will just continue. And now it will actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=405" target="_blank">00:06:45.300</a></span> | <span class="t">just see how it starts it off. Created React, workspace, water hydration tracking app, material UI,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=410" target="_blank">00:06:50.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Apple-esque design. It made a plan in the background. And now it shares the hybrid plan with us. And it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=416" target="_blank">00:06:56.580</a></span> | <span class="t">goes off. So, we can go back to the slides and not care about the code.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=422" target="_blank">00:07:02.660</a></span> | <span class="t">NPM install. NPM dev. So, I trust it. It will do stuff.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=425" target="_blank">00:07:05.380</a></span> | <span class="t">And the model used is the one that was at the bottom?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=428" target="_blank">00:07:08.980</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. Yeah. So, this is using Cloudson 4, which I found really good at UI. I actually ran the same</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=434" target="_blank">00:07:14.580</a></span> | <span class="t">demo with different models. 4.1 makes it look very wireframe-y. 2.5 Pro has an interesting design sense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=441" target="_blank">00:07:21.220</a></span> | <span class="t">where it always looks somewhat different. And Cloudsonnet makes it always look like a blockchain landing page,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=447" target="_blank">00:07:27.060</a></span> | <span class="t">if you make it wrong. So, lots of gradients and dark and big letters. So, to kind of -- as we -- seven minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=456" target="_blank">00:07:36.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So, we have YOLO toolbox. There's a new workspace flow that's really interesting. So, if you haven't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=461" target="_blank">00:07:41.940</a></span> | <span class="t">tried it out yet. It can also trip you off if you ask for something, a new app and an existing project.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=467" target="_blank">00:07:47.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Make sure you -- if you hit that.

There's an autosave that I really like to drive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=488" target="_blank">00:08:08.660</a></span> | <span class="t">any live updates in the background that are running.

Still installing. Beautiful WiFi. Making demos easier.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=507" target="_blank">00:08:27.620</a></span> | <span class="t">Yes. Actually, when it -- when this runs and it runs in the terminal commands and the terminal commands</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=518" target="_blank">00:08:38.340</a></span> | <span class="t">fail, it will actually look at the output. So, if there's any dependencies missing, it will go off and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=523" target="_blank">00:08:43.220</a></span> | <span class="t">install them. It's still like chat.cn had some changes in how you install it, for example. It will figure out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=528" target="_blank">00:08:48.740</a></span> | <span class="t">because the error messages.

Okay. Let's keep going. Next one. While it runs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=547" target="_blank">00:09:07.460</a></span> | <span class="t">It's -- use YOLO VibeCoding. So, really try it out. Go. Embrace the exponentials to build that AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=555" target="_blank">00:09:15.060</a></span> | <span class="t">intuition. Like, what is AI good at? What AI can't do yet? And find that for yourself. Just baseline what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=562" target="_blank">00:09:22.180</a></span> | <span class="t">AI can do. And that's where YOLO VibeCoding with, like, a very open canvas and being able to steer AI</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=568" target="_blank">00:09:28.180</a></span> | <span class="t">is an extremely powerful skill to inform all of other AI usage. Then the second one is using</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=574" target="_blank">00:09:34.740</a></span> | <span class="t">frameworks. I pick React invite in my demo because it gives a nice grounding and it's something that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=579" target="_blank">00:09:39.220</a></span> | <span class="t">hasn't changed in a while. So, that's a good way. If you use any new ones, you want to be more</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=584" target="_blank">00:09:44.580</a></span> | <span class="t">explicit about how to read the docs and where to find information. And lastly, it's all about iteration.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=590" target="_blank">00:09:50.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So, it's a whiteboard. You want to wipe things off completely. You want to start from scratch. You want to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=594" target="_blank">00:09:54.580</a></span> | <span class="t">work on specific items. But it's really about, like, having this iterative workflow outlined.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=599" target="_blank">00:09:59.860</a></span> | <span class="t">Quick check-in. Still working on some files. Okay. We keep going. So, structured VibeCoding. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=607" target="_blank">00:10:07.700</a></span> | <span class="t">where we bring in a template. And that template comes with a consistent tech stack. And that could be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=613" target="_blank">00:10:13.460</a></span> | <span class="t">your internal stack. It would be a container that you give to developers. So, if you want to work on UX,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=618" target="_blank">00:10:18.500</a></span> | <span class="t">bring this template in and you can just start vibing. That could be even for non-technical people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=624" target="_blank">00:10:24.500</a></span> | <span class="t">Just check out this repo or work from this template on GitHub, open NBS code, engage agent mode in voice</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=632" target="_blank">00:10:32.100</a></span> | <span class="t">mode and start vibing. But because it's a template, it comes with this consistent tech stack. And it comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=638" target="_blank">00:10:38.180</a></span> | <span class="t">with instructions to guide the copilot flow onto specific conventions that you're running with.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=645" target="_blank">00:10:45.460</a></span> | <span class="t">And then, lastly, we want custom tools using MCP and other things to make sure if it needs information or</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=651" target="_blank">00:10:51.860</a></span> | <span class="t">needs more context. And that's really more reliable and more consistent than YOLO mode. If you ask YOLO mode,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=659" target="_blank">00:10:59.300</a></span> | <span class="t">and if it wouldn't have given it material UI, it might have picked any other design framework, it might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.620</a></span> | <span class="t">have went with Tailwind. So, that allows you to, internally, we use Fluent UI. So, you're going to use</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.740</a></span> | <span class="t">Fluent UI. This is where you get the package and just it's outlined and it's clear. And so, it's really</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=674" target="_blank">00:11:14.340</a></span> | <span class="t">great for bootstrapping these screenfield projects because you end up with something people can hand over to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=679" target="_blank">00:11:19.140</a></span> | <span class="t">engineering. And engineering doesn't say, like, this is totally not what we're doing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.700</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is also, it's better at the off mainstream. Like, anything that's not popular, like Spring Boot,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=689" target="_blank">00:11:29.380</a></span> | <span class="t">whatever latest version you have that the AI struggles with, you can add more instructions on top that it</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=694" target="_blank">00:11:34.340</a></span> | <span class="t">gets it right more often. I'm going to show a quick how it looks like. It's still vibing. I think it's mostly</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=704" target="_blank">00:11:44.660</a></span> | <span class="t">the internet speed here, making it slow. So, let's figure out -- this is a nice repo. It's actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.220</a></span> | <span class="t">on the -- on the internet. If you go to GitHub.coms.digitarout. And then I put it up.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=719" target="_blank">00:11:59.220</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's still on there. Frontend Vibes template. So, let's see if I'm in. If you want to take a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=725" target="_blank">00:12:05.220</a></span> | <span class="t">screenshot for later -- again? How's the screen sharing working? I don't know. I'm not technical.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=735" target="_blank">00:12:15.780</a></span> | <span class="t">It's this entire screen, right? So, okay. Yeah, I think every time I switch back to PowerPoint,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.500</a></span> | <span class="t">it tries to do the mode screen again. Okay. So, GitHub again. Sharing the vibes here. Two minutes.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=755" target="_blank">00:12:35.460</a></span> | <span class="t">Okay. We got good. Yeah. So, that's a nice template. Just going to do a quick roundup. So, one, we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=760" target="_blank">00:12:40.180</a></span> | <span class="t">chat modes. That's what I'm highlighted here on the left. GitHub. folder chat modes. And you can define</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=767" target="_blank">00:12:47.060</a></span> | <span class="t">already tools. You find what tools are in the mode and what's the system prompt. And then they show up</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=773" target="_blank">00:12:53.380</a></span> | <span class="t">down here. Actually, you can switch out agent. It's a new agent that's now doing test-driven development</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=778" target="_blank">00:12:58.820</a></span> | <span class="t">for you. And that description here I wrote in another demo earlier about how to do test-driven development.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=784" target="_blank">00:13:04.740</a></span> | <span class="t">I didn't know there's a red, green, and anything else. So, that's up to you how you define that mode.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=790" target="_blank">00:13:10.260</a></span> | <span class="t">But this basically now guides it. You have to write tests first. And then you write code and that has to pass.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=796" target="_blank">00:13:16.100</a></span> | <span class="t">And only ask only move to writing code after I confirm because I want to review the test. And that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=800" target="_blank">00:13:20.580</a></span> | <span class="t">much easier for review to me. You can also create prompts. And that's a way for your team to create</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=806" target="_blank">00:13:26.100</a></span> | <span class="t">these reusable tasks that are then used across different iterations. It could be a new landing page</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=810" target="_blank">00:13:30.900</a></span> | <span class="t">for your design team. Like, we need a new micro landing page. This is how you structure it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=815" target="_blank">00:13:35.220</a></span> | <span class="t">And then you can just create it. And lastly, instructions. Those are new. Those are .github/instructions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=822" target="_blank">00:13:42.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And those can outline what specific parts of the code base do.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=825" target="_blank">00:13:45.140</a></span> | <span class="t">So, to go back to the slides. Yeah, the thing again. So, you want to bring in workspace instructions.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=834" target="_blank">00:13:54.420</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a good document on VS code documentation on customization. If you want to go deeper, there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=839" target="_blank">00:13:59.220</a></span> | <span class="t">instructions files I showed and prompts. You want to make them dynamic for specific parts of the code base.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.140</a></span> | <span class="t">And you want to start bringing in MCP.

So, if you have your task runners set up in VS code and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=861" target="_blank">00:14:21.220</a></span> | <span class="t">your linters properly, it will actually start fixing code as it makes mistakes, which is a really powerful</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.140</a></span> | <span class="t">context to have for the AI. And lastly, if you haven't found that little sparkle icon and then you commit,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=873" target="_blank">00:14:33.060</a></span> | <span class="t">it's really important once you start working and having workable code to keep committing that workable code</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=878" target="_blank">00:14:38.580</a></span> | <span class="t">so you don't get into weird areas where it worked before and now my Vibe coding broke it. And that's always sad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=884" target="_blank">00:14:44.180</a></span> | <span class="t">So, review is important.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1uPAN6uW4s&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.260</a></span> | <span class="t">Always says on these instructions are important.
