Like these are just very different things. Like your toaster and your computer are both machines, but one's much more sophisticated than another. - You're confident with Tesla you can create the world's best toaster? - The world's best toaster, yes. The world's best self-driving. Yes. To me right now this seems game set match. I don't want to be complacent or overconfident, but that's what it, that is just literally how it appears right now. I could be wrong, but it appears to be the case that Tesla is vastly ahead of everyone.
