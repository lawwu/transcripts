target="_blank">00:14:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So at my time at my my jobs, typically I would start off on the UI and then they'd be like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.020</a></span> | <span class="t">OK, well, hey, we need a library for this thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=888" target="_blank">00:14:48.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So then I'd be the one writing like the library.</span></div><div

that can behave just like an iPad.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=897" target="_blank">00:14:57.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So

still a web page because we didn't have any of that stuff back then.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=901" target="_blank">00:15:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It was a canvas had to do all the like matrices operations and all that stuff to kind of,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

into a job, it's like, OK, hey, we need to do a library.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=917" target="_blank">00:15:17.020</a></span>

<span class="t">So back then there was no grunt.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=921" target="_blank">00:15:21.020</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=931" target="_blank">00:15:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've always really enjoyed that region.</span></div><div class="c"><span

target="_blank">00:15:45.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I just I've always really enjoyed that aspect because your share your stakeholders</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=949" target="_blank">00:15:49.020</a></span> | <span class="t">and the people that use your program understand programming.</span></div><div

this.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=954" target="_blank">00:15:54.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And typically the thing that they need, they actually want.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Whereas with people, people want stuff, but what they actually need versus what they actually</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=962"

of trying to really figure it out.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=975" target="_blank">00:16:15.020</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=984" target="_blank">00:16:24.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So I love the idea of just kind of starting at the interface, like you need to pinch

mean, I have no idea what the girls experience of how.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2016" target="_blank">00:33:36.020</a></span> | <span class="t">The girls experience of high school would be like, but as a guy, there's definitely a lot of like physical requirements in high school.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2023" target="_blank">00:33:43.020</a></span> | <span class="t">There's a lot of physical measurement, at least where I grew up.</span></div><div

if they're filled with boys, it's probably true.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2031" target="_blank">00:33:51.020</a></span> | <span

yeah, it probably does help to do those things to go to BJJ, to do any of these activities, because even if you don't ever kick someone's ass, just having some level of confidence in yourself is probably a very valuable thing.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2044" target="_blank">00:34:04.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But just remembering that this is such a short, tiny moment in your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2051" target="_blank">00:34:11.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just like a huge help.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2052" target="_blank">00:34:12.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, the way you phrased it is exactly right.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2056" target="_blank">00:34:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">That's what it feels like that this is, these are the people that will be with you for the rest of your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2061" target="_blank">00:34:21.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And this is

that there'll be just tremendous amount of impact if somebody picks on you, or if you fall somebody low, somewhere low in the hierarchy, in the status hierarchy of this high school, that means you'll be low in the status hierarchy of the world and you're fucked for the rest of your life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2079" target="_blank">00:34:39.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And that carries a tremendous amount of weight.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2082" target="_blank">00:34:42.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It's just why psychologically it's extremely difficult to be.</span></div><div

how difficult it is to be a high schooler, how difficult psychologically it is, how it actually makes sense that some people would suffer from depression and be on the verge of suicide.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2099" target="_blank">00:34:59.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very, very

target="_blank">00:35:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I think it's genuinely harder today than it's ever been in the sense that when I was a kid, there was a qualification to people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2112" target="_blank">00:35:12.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, this is a cool

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2122" target="_blank">00:35:22.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Like there, people can visually, they can inspect your exact social value on

can imagine that there's a lot of, of just so much weight to put on that, that it's just, it feels probably way worse and way more damning to be uncool because you have an exact number of how uncool you are.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2144" target="_blank">00:35:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2147" target="_blank">00:35:47.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And the task, the quest is to remember that just because your social circle on social media and in high school thinks you're uncool, it actually might mean you are cool.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2163"

as far as impact goes is that you will have such a long and broken look at women.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2343"

target="_blank">00:39:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It's purely a want-based activity or a lust, however you want, whatever word you can fill in there.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2368" target="_blank">00:39:28.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And it is purely an objectifying activity.</span></div><div

this around.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2377" target="_blank">00:39:37.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Like I do think that the women that I dated during high school or the women after high school and college, like I looked at them as a means to an end.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2384" target="_blank">00:39:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think porn greatly kind of shifted that kind of perspective in my head that I did not give the value that was desired to another person.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2392"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2397" target="_blank">00:39:57.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And that makes people into commodities.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2399" target="_blank">00:39:59.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And I don't think people are commodities.</span></div><div

great effect of porn is that, you know, it's just consumerism gone wild or materialism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2411"

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2423" target="_blank">00:40:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Like it's a very private, it can be very short session.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2426" target="_blank">00:40:26.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It doesn't have to be something that takes like, you know, you can't take acid, then go out to lunch, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2430" target="_blank">00:40:30.020</a></span>

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2438" target="_blank">00:40:38.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And then obviously there's like all the, like the science and, you know, statistics, like men make worse decisions for some period of time after looking or being exposed to sexualized images.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2446" target="_blank">00:40:46.020</a></span> | <span class="t">There's the whole dopamine effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

some amount of people.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2469" target="_blank">00:41:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But for me, it

so, it's kind of like a unique kind of, I forget the right term here, but it's a unique way at looking at the problems and our society puts so much emphasis.</span></div><div class="c"><span

just all the dopamine effect that it is.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2720" target="_blank">00:45:20.020</a></span> | <span

<span class="t">Um, you know, like, I don't look at porn.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2739" target="_blank">00:45:39.020</a></span> | <span class="t">My wife has complete confidence in me that there is not going to be a situation in which she has to question me in any kind of sense.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2744" target="_blank">00:45:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And that builds a much more deeply, I would argue a very deep relationship because the trust is that much bigger.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2752" target="_blank">00:45:52.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I think the deepness of the relationship is probably proportional to the trust you have in each other.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2756" target="_blank">00:45:56.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It's very hard to have a deep relationship with no

of trust is vulnerability to where you, like, take the leap of being vulnerable with another human being.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2772" target="_blank">00:46:12.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And that vulnerability when reciprocated builds this, this really strong trust.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2778" target="_blank">00:46:18.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And it's a beautiful

even more challenging, you know, being vulnerable with the world.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2788" target="_blank">00:46:28.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And there's a bunch of people out there that want to hurt you for it.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2791" target="_blank">00:46:31.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And, um, but I think it's worth well anyway, to be vulnerable.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2796" target="_blank">00:46:36.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It's always worth it.</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2798" target="_blank">00:46:38.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And in some sense, like obviously everyone has a different kind of life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2802" target="_blank">00:46:42.020</a></span> | <span class="t">They have to filter through their actions with, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2804" target="_blank">00:46:44.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Because the person that has no say social following or anything, their risk reward profile could just be local impact, which could be just as, you know, damning or harming to them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2813" target="_blank">00:46:53.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2814" target="_blank">00:46:54.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And so it's always worth the risk though, in my personal opinion, because like finding my wife has been obviously the most impactful or changing thing in my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2823" target="_blank">00:47:03.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So, or second most, I'd argue that one night with God would probably be the most impactful thing that led to everything else.</span></div><div

impactful.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=2831" target="_blank">00:47:11.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I mean, I'm like cleaning

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3448" target="_blank">00:57:28.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, categorically, as you can see, and just like how people experience drug addiction.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3452" target="_blank">00:57:32.020</a></span> | <span class="t">No.</span></div><div

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3600" target="_blank">01:00:00.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think it's, it worked for me.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3602" target="_blank">01:00:02.020</a></span> | <span class="t">It works the same as if the, if the liquid actually looks like alcohol, it does the same purpose often.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3610" target="_blank">01:00:10.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Because like alcohol from like if you have a whiskey or a beer looking thing, it kind of sends a signal that we should be having fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3620" target="_blank">01:00:20.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So we're socializing, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3623" target="_blank">01:00:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And then that means you don't actually need the alcohol.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3626" target="_blank">01:00:26.020</a></span> | <span class="t">You can get fucking crazy without the alcohol substance.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3630" target="_blank">01:00:30.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah.</span></div><div

happens when you have a drink in your hand.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3639" target="_blank">01:00:39.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So I've been to get togethers where I'm not drinking, but just doing like a fake drink situation.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3645" target="_blank">01:00:45.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And I can also have fun.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

when you need to be able to don a bottle of vodka.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3653" target="_blank">01:00:53.020</a></span> | <span class="t">That's very essential for the, for my line of work.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3655" target="_blank">01:00:55.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But, but that's, that's sort of, that's almost like a cultural experience versus like a necessary component of a successful social interaction and one that brings you happiness.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3665" target="_blank">01:01:05.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So not drinking, I think you can have fun and not drink too.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3669" target="_blank">01:01:09.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So all of this, man, I'm so careful saying drugs have had a, a good effect on my life.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3677" target="_blank">01:01:17.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Because I think for most people, no, for majority of people, they will in the long term, long term have a negative effect.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3686" target="_blank">01:01:26.020</a></span> | <span

to choose one or the other, just no drugs, uh, and no drinking means one day you can be the president of the United States kids.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

escapism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3721" target="_blank">01:02:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I'm sure that's like, would be the archetype or the box I'd put that into, or the pursuit of trying to feel something that cannot come from them.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a

target="_blank">01:02:23.020</a></span> | <span class="t">You know, maybe some people in specific jobs, you know, like this, obviously have very broad strokes.</span></div><div class="c"><span

target="_blank">01:02:33.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So I'm not saying all things, but like, as programming goes, most programmers, you cannot just simply find your purpose and same with drugs.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3760" target="_blank">01:02:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Like you cannot find that thing

target="_blank">01:02:59.020</a></span> | <span class="t">The other moment you mentioned that I think is really inspiring is that, you know, you failed pre-calculus.</span></div><div class="c"><span

class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3808" target="_blank">01:03:28.020</a></span> | <span class="t">A very fast speed run of it is that I took pre-calculus failed.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3812" target="_blank">01:03:32.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I took pre-calculus again, failed, took pre-calculus again, and got a C.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3815" target="_blank">01:03:35.020</a></span> | <span

then I took calc over the summer.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3820" target="_blank">01:03:40.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So calc one.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3821" target="_blank">01:03:41.020</a></span> | <span class="t">In that one, at the end, the final, the final was a two hour final.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3826" target="_blank">01:03:46.020</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:03:50.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And I proceeded to be the highest score in all calculus and Diffy Q.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3833" target="_blank">01:03:53.020</a></span> | <span class="t">I was the only person out of 400 people to finish the Diffy Q final.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3836" target="_blank">01:03:56.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Uh, and I got the highest grade.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3839" target="_blank">01:03:59.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And so I was like, I got really good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3841" target="_blank">01:04:01.020</a></span> | <span class="t">So I somehow went from really bad to really good.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3843" target="_blank">01:04:03.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And so my only, the thing that I did is that I had to win.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3848" target="_blank">01:04:08.020</a></span> | <span

not like, oh, you know, this would be really great.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3851" target="_blank">01:04:11.020</a></span> |

target="_blank">01:04:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And so every single day I got up, I went to my, what, however many hour class it was.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3862" target="_blank">01:04:22.020</a></span> | <span class="t">Right after that, I went straight to the math learning center, did those problems.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3865" target="_blank">01:04:25.020</a></span> | <span class="t">When I got home, I just got the book and it had the odd answers in the back.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3869" target="_blank">01:04:29.020</a></span> | <span

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3874" target="_blank">01:04:34.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And it just became this thing where it's just, I just simple rote memory took over.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3879" target="_blank">01:04:39.020</a></span> | <span class="t">And the ability to just effectively have the times table, but for calculus all stuck in my head, inverse trig substitution, trig substitution, doing Taylor McLaren series, like all those things kind of just over and over and over and over and over again.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNZnLkRBYA8&t=3891" target="_blank">01:04:51.020</a></span> | <span

target="_blank">01:05:16.020</a></span> | <span class="t">But if I can do it once, literally, then it's really easy for me to go into the abstract.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
