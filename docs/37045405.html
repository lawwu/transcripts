class="t">But one of the things I remember about reading in the summertime is that almost everywhere had a summer book club or a summer reading program.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37045405/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.540</a></span> | <span

class="t">I came, I'm telling my age, I came from the era that Pizza Hut had a summer reading program and you could earn a personal pan pizza for reading books, which was for me a slam dunk because I was going to read even if somebody didn't give me a pizza.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37045405/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=140" target="_blank">00:02:20.180</a></span> | <span

class="t">Kelly, let me ask you first.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37045405/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=156" target="_blank">00:02:36.620</a></span> | <span

class="t">Well, you know that I did because any opportunity to capitalize on what I was already going to be doing was fabulous.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/37045405/height/45/theme/standard/thumbnail/yes/direction/forward/tdest_id/329601/&t=166" target="_blank">00:02:46.000</a></span> | <span

class="t">And so summer reading club was always a part of my relaxing activities once the academic year concluded because it was time for me to finally get my hands on the big stack of books that I had been accumulating throughout the school year and hadn't quite gotten to yet.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a
