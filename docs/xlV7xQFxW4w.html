So we're talking 16 years of compounding.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1019" target="_blank">00:16:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">My first rule here is just do no harm. If we're talking $400 a month, that's $4,800</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.480</a></span> | <span class="t">a year. And that's also what? $77,000 over 16 years, if my math is right there? That's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1032" target="_blank">00:17:12.920</a></span> | <span class="t">almost $77,000. That's pretty good. So back of the envelope, if you've got a 5% return</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1037" target="_blank">00:17:17.960</a></span> | <span class="t">on that, we're talking, I don't know, $113,000. If you've got 7%, we're talking over $130k.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1043" target="_blank">00:17:23.360</a></span> | <span class="t">So that's real money. So unless the system completely falls apart, if you invest this</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1048" target="_blank">00:17:28.360</a></span> | <span class="t">in any sort of diversified portfolio of financial assets that aren't completely insane and some</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1055" target="_blank">00:17:35.000</a></span> | <span class="t">really smart 30-year-old billionaire walks away with them, I think you're gonna be okay.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1059" target="_blank">00:17:39.080</a></span> | <span class="t">So my one piece of advice would be just don't try to shoot the moon with this.

Low cost, dollar cost averaging every month,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1184" target="_blank">00:19:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">it's gonna be a home run.

So upon some Googling, it seems like the rules vary</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1197" target="_blank">00:19:57.640</a></span> | <span class="t">state to state. And just make sure that while you might think, "Okay, college is taken care</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1202" target="_blank">00:20:02.720</a></span> | <span class="t">of. I'm all set." Just read the fine print and make sure you know exactly what that means.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1208" target="_blank">00:20:08.880</a></span> | <span class="t">Because if it means that it's free as long as they go to a state university and you live</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1216" target="_blank">00:20:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">in Ohio and your child says, "I don't want to go to Ohio State. I want to go to Michigan,"</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1222" target="_blank">00:20:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">let's say.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1223" target="_blank">00:20:23.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Nothing wrong with that.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1224" target="_blank">00:20:24.960</a></span> | <span class="t">Nothing wrong with that.

The taxes piece of it,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1239" target="_blank">00:20:39.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you do get a little bit of an advantage in that the first $1,100, I believe it is, there</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1246" target="_blank">00:20:46.680</a></span> | <span class="t">is no tax on it, the first $1,100 of gain. So whether that be capital gains or income</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1253" target="_blank">00:20:53.000</a></span> | <span class="t">or distributions from a fund you might invest in, the next $1,100 is taxed at your child's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1258" target="_blank">00:20:58.840</a></span> | <span class="t">rate, which probably is going to be effectively zero. I think it's technically 10%, but effectively</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1264" target="_blank">00:21:04.200</a></span> | <span class="t">it's zero.

The other piece is when they do reach age of majority,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1274" target="_blank">00:21:14.400</a></span> | <span class="t">which it depends the state, it could be as low as 18, as high as 25, there's nothing</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1280" target="_blank">00:21:20.160</a></span> | <span class="t">stopping your child from getting access to that money outside of you basically hiding</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1284" target="_blank">00:21:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the account. But once that child does reach the age of majority, they call whatever custodian</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1291" target="_blank">00:21:31.560</a></span> | <span class="t">you have it at and say, "Cash me out.

Which is probably why it makes sense to use it as a learning tool as well. So they</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1300" target="_blank">00:21:40.760</a></span> | <span class="t">understand this is a big responsibility when you get that much money at that age.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1304" target="_blank">00:21:44.600</a></span> | <span class="t">Exactly. But what it does at that point that just opening a brokerage account in your name</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1311" target="_blank">00:21:51.000</a></span> | <span class="t">and kind of just mentally putting that to the side for your child is if Ben's assumptions</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1317" target="_blank">00:21:57.280</a></span> | <span class="t">are correct, and let's say there's $130,000 in there at 18 or 20, whenever it is, and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1323" target="_blank">00:22:03.200</a></span> | <span class="t">you want to give that money to your child, you've got gift tax considerations.

Yeah, I mean, ultimately, this is kind of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1795" target="_blank">00:29:55.140</a></span> | <span class="t">what you hope for, right?

And so, that's excellent. And clearly, we've got some forward-thinking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1807" target="_blank">00:30:07.460</a></span> | <span class="t">folks here as far as what to be focusing on. And yeah, there is no right answer. Ultimately,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1813" target="_blank">00:30:13.620</a></span> | <span class="t">I think personal finances, as you guys have said, as we've said a lot, it is personal.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1818" target="_blank">00:30:18.180</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, what exists on a spreadsheet doesn't necessarily, and what makes sense on the spreadsheet</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1824" target="_blank">00:30:24.120</a></span> | <span class="t">may not make sense in your head or your stomach or your heart, right?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1828" target="_blank">00:30:28.860</a></span> | <span class="t">And so, I have clients that have a 3% mortgage, and they are making extra payments to their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1837" target="_blank">00:30:37.980</a></span> | <span class="t">mortgage to pay down the principal. And they've got 20 years left on the mortgage. Well, if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1842" target="_blank">00:30:42.860</a></span> | <span class="t">we assume that over the next 20 years, the market is going to return more than that 3%,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1848" target="_blank">00:30:48.140</a></span> | <span class="t">the spreadsheet, the math would suggest, you absolutely don't put more money into that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1851" target="_blank">00:30:51.980</a></span> | <span class="t">mortgage.

And so, some ways you give yourself a bump in standard of living, so it's not</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1927" target="_blank">00:32:07.760</a></span> | <span class="t">all for nothing. But then you figure out, "Okay, with 20% of this I'm going to repay</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1931" target="_blank">00:32:11.940</a></span> | <span class="t">debt, and the other 30% I'm going to save more." And sort of figure out some sort of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1935" target="_blank">00:32:15.400</a></span> | <span class="t">set allocation there. And then you can kind of adjust going forward, depending on what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1939" target="_blank">00:32:19.700</a></span> | <span class="t">happens.

So, I think splitting</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1952" target="_blank">00:32:32.940</a></span> | <span class="t">the difference in some ways can be a good way to test it out, doing an A/B test to figure</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1956" target="_blank">00:32:36.260</a></span> | <span class="t">out which one is going to make you happier anyway, because some people just don't know</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1959" target="_blank">00:32:39.140</a></span> | <span class="t">either.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlV7xQFxW4w&t=1960" target="_blank">00:32:40.140</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, that's true.
