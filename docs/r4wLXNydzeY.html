And now, dear friends,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=86" target="_blank">00:01:26.080</a></span> | <span class="t">here's John Mearsheimer. Can you explain your view on power in international politics as outlined in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=93" target="_blank">00:01:33.760</a></span> | <span class="t">your book "The Tragedy of Great Power Politics" and in your writing since then? Yeah, I make two</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=99" target="_blank">00:01:39.680</a></span> | <span class="t">sets of points there. First of all, I believe that power is the currency of international relations.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=106" target="_blank">00:01:46.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And by that, I mean that states are deeply interested in the balance of power and they're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=111" target="_blank">00:01:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">interested in maximizing how much power they control. And the question is why states care</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=118" target="_blank">00:01:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">so much about power. In the international system, there's no higher authority. So if you get into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=125" target="_blank">00:02:05.840</a></span> | <span class="t">trouble and you dial 911, there's nobody at the other end. In a system like that, you have no</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=134" target="_blank">00:02:14.320</a></span> | <span class="t">choice but to figure out for yourself how best to protect yourself. And the best way to protect</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=142" target="_blank">00:02:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">yourself is to be powerful, to have as much power as you can possibly gain over all the other states</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=149" target="_blank">00:02:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">in the system. Therefore, states care about power because it enhances or maximizes their prospects</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=157" target="_blank">00:02:37.760</a></span> | <span class="t">for survival. Second point I would make is that in the realist story or in my story, power is largely</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a function of material factors. The two key building blocks of power are population size</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=174" target="_blank">00:02:54.960</a></span> | <span class="t">and wealth. You want to have a lot of people and you want to be really wealthy. Of course,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=179" target="_blank">00:02:59.840</a></span> | <span class="t">this is why the United States is so powerful. It has lots of people and it has lots of wealth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=186" target="_blank">00:03:06.720</a></span> | <span class="t">China was not considered a great power until recently because it didn't have a lot of wealth.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.000</a></span> | <span class="t">It certainly had population size, but it didn't have wealth. And without both a large population</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=200" target="_blank">00:03:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">and much wealth, you're usually not considered a great power. So I think power matters,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">but when we talk about power, it's important to understand that it's population size and wealth</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=215" target="_blank">00:03:35.360</a></span> | <span class="t">that are underpinning it. - So there's a lot of interesting things there. First, you said nations</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">in relation to each other is essentially in a state of anarchism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=228" target="_blank">00:03:48.240</a></span> | <span class="t">- Yeah, well, anarchy basically means the opposite of hierarchy. Sometimes people think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=235" target="_blank">00:03:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">when you're talking about anarchy, you're talking about murder and mayhem, but that's not what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=239" target="_blank">00:03:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">anarchy means in the realist context. Anarchy simply means that you don't have hierarchy.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=245" target="_blank">00:04:05.360</a></span> | <span class="t">There's no higher authority that sits above states. States are like pool balls on a table,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=252" target="_blank">00:04:12.240</a></span> | <span class="t">right? And in an anarchic world, there's no higher authority that you can turn to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=260" target="_blank">00:04:20.000</a></span> | <span class="t">if you get into trouble. And of course, the political philosopher who laid this all out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=267" target="_blank">00:04:27.040</a></span> | <span class="t">was Thomas Hobbes. And Hobbes talked about life in the state of nature. And in the state of nature,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=273" target="_blank">00:04:33.920</a></span> | <span class="t">you have individuals and those individuals compete with each other for power. And the reason that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=280" target="_blank">00:04:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">they do is because in the state of nature, by definition, you have no higher authority.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.200</a></span> | <span class="t">And Hobbes' view is that the way to get out of this terrible situation where individuals are</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.640</a></span> | <span class="t">competing with each other and even killing each other is to create a state. It's what he calls</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.000</a></span> | <span class="t">the Leviathan. And that, of course, is the title of his famous book. So the idea is to escape</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=306" target="_blank">00:05:06.160</a></span> | <span class="t">anarchy, you create a state. And that means you go from anarchy to hierarchy. The problem in</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=314" target="_blank">00:05:14.240</a></span> | <span class="t">international politics is that there is no world state, there is no hierarchy. And if you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=321" target="_blank">00:05:21.040</a></span> | <span class="t">no hierarchy and you're in an anarchic system, you have no choice but to try to maximize your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=328" target="_blank">00:05:28.960</a></span> | <span class="t">relative power to make sure you are, as we used to say, when I was a kid on New York City playgrounds,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=335" target="_blank">00:05:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the biggest and baddest dude on the block.

I believe we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=8280" target="_blank">02:18:00.720</a></span> | <span class="t">born into tribes, we're heavily socialized, and that we carve out space for our individualism.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=8288" target="_blank">02:18:08.720</a></span> | <span class="t">But we are part of tribes or social groups or nations, call them what you want, ethnic groups,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=8296" target="_blank">02:18:16.000</a></span> | <span class="t">religious groups.

If you go to a place like Bosnia,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=8309" target="_blank">02:18:29.440</a></span> | <span class="t">right, the Croats and the Serbs, oh my God, and then throw in the Bosniaks,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=8316" target="_blank">02:18:36.800</a></span> | <span class="t">which is the term for Bosnian Muslims, and Muslims, Croats, Serbs, oh, and the tribes hate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4wLXNydzeY&t=8327" target="_blank">02:18:47.680</a></span> | <span class="t">each other.
