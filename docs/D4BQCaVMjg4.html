This is, you know, a cause and concern for many because on the one hand, we have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=286" target="_blank">00:04:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">more innovation, we have more startups, and so you would think you would have more public companies,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=292" target="_blank">00:04:52.160</a></span> | <span class="t">not less. And if you look around the world, that's in fact what you see. And what you saw for a long</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=298" target="_blank">00:04:58.160</a></span> | <span class="t">time in the history of public markets in the U.S. up until this recent period. But this is a big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=303" target="_blank">00:05:03.680</a></span> | <span class="t">number. It's like over 40%. Yes. Like significant. Over probably the most prolific period of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=311" target="_blank">00:05:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">innovation in the history of the United States.

And perhaps concerning the number of private equity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=325" target="_blank">00:05:25.600</a></span> | <span class="t">backed companies had skyrocketed from 1,900 to over 11,000. So, you know, I started, you and I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=334" target="_blank">00:05:34.080</a></span> | <span class="t">started kicking around like what are some of the, you know, first, you know, are these, is this bad?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=339" target="_blank">00:05:39.120</a></span> | <span class="t">What are some of the causes of this? And of course, there was a tweet last week about Philippe</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=344" target="_blank">00:05:44.400</a></span> | <span class="t">Lafont, who I think was speaking at the information event in New York, where Philippe said, listen,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=350" target="_blank">00:05:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the markets have structurally changed.

Gokul tweeted something similar at first, looking at some Meritech data. He said, it looks</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=369" target="_blank">00:06:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">like unless you have 700 million in revenue, then you'll probably underperform in the public markets.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=376" target="_blank">00:06:16.960</a></span> | <span class="t">So here's his tweet there. And then Jam and Ball on our team, you know, responded to that and showed</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=383" target="_blank">00:06:23.520</a></span> | <span class="t">some data that we'll show here that says, no, in fact, if you look at the, you know, the last 10</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=390" target="_blank">00:06:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">years, the average software IPO has been about 185 in median revenue over the last 12 months.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=401" target="_blank">00:06:41.600</a></span> | <span class="t">And it has over 50 percent growth.

I have always believed and I'm</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=457" target="_blank">00:07:37.520</a></span> | <span class="t">not the only one there.

So the median growth rate</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=582" target="_blank">00:09:42.080</a></span> | <span class="t">has been around 50 percent and attractive unit economics.

And I've been making this case that the IPO window is wide open. It's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=614" target="_blank">00:10:14.160</a></span> | <span class="t">just a matter of price.

Right. Those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=626" target="_blank">00:10:26.640</a></span> | <span class="t">are terrific companies to back so long as the point of entry is at a price that reflects what</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=631" target="_blank">00:10:31.600</a></span> | <span class="t">current market multiples is. So, you know, he's kind of taking the other side of the argument</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=636" target="_blank">00:10:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">saying this is not a demand problem. This isn't that you can't get it into the market. It's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=641" target="_blank">00:10:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">supply problem that's for some reason companies just don't want to come into the market at that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=646" target="_blank">00:10:46.640</a></span> | <span class="t">size. That becomes a circular argument, right? Because if people start saying that, you know,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=653" target="_blank">00:10:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">externally, oh, you've got to be at one hundred or you've got to be at two hundred, you've got to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=656" target="_blank">00:10:56.800</a></span> | <span class="t">at seven hundred. Then people hear that and then they think they can't go. And so, you know, but</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=663" target="_blank">00:11:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">let's talk about some things that have led to this. You know, on one hand, there's immense</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=668" target="_blank">00:11:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">capital availability that I had suspected might go away with the market reset, but it clearly didn't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=675" target="_blank">00:11:15.440</a></span> | <span class="t">or with interest rates going up. And so companies that don't want to be public don't have to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=681" target="_blank">00:11:21.840</a></span> | <span class="t">because they can get access to private capital. And at least today, that private capital will</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=688" target="_blank">00:11:28.560</a></span> | <span class="t">let them do secondaries, which solves one of the problems that that historically has brought them</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=695" target="_blank">00:11:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">to the public market. Second, you know, I think structurally those people you call have built</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=702" target="_blank">00:11:42.640</a></span> | <span class="t">their Wall Street businesses to cater to these larger companies. And so they prefer to work on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=709" target="_blank">00:11:49.600</a></span> | <span class="t">a bigger IPO. Way back when there was a group of bankers known as the Four Horsemen that took a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=715" target="_blank">00:11:55.120</a></span> | <span class="t">ton of companies in Silicon Valley public. And I found some data which we can put up, but like</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=723" target="_blank">00:12:03.280</a></span> | <span class="t">the vast majority of IPOs are being underwritten by like four or five firms. And one thing that I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=730" target="_blank">00:12:10.000</a></span> | <span class="t">think would be helpful is if some of the other firms were kind of more dedicated to a smaller IPO</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=736" target="_blank">00:12:16.480</a></span> | <span class="t">where everyone knew they were the go to for that. But that doesn't I don't think anyone's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=742" target="_blank">00:12:22.640</a></span> | <span class="t">filling that role today. And so those are two big things. And then the third one that could</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=747" target="_blank">00:12:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">contribute to it is just regulation. And I throw the cost of being public in with regulation. So</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=754" target="_blank">00:12:34.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that could include litigation costs, you know, the insurance you have to buy for your board,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=761" target="_blank">00:12:41.120</a></span> | <span class="t">all those things like is the cost of being public. It's probably two to five million a year</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=766" target="_blank">00:12:46.480</a></span> | <span class="t">just to be public. So let's break those down a little bit because I think, you know, it's a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=772" target="_blank">00:12:52.000</a></span> | <span class="t">combination of factors, right? So let's just normalize around one. So if you pull up this chart</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=779" target="_blank">00:12:59.920</a></span> | <span class="t">on the Instacart valuation, right, over the course of the last several years. So Instacart was one of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=786" target="_blank">00:13:06.320</a></span> | <span class="t">these companies that got, you know, really high valuations during the pull forward that we saw</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=792" target="_blank">00:13:12.880</a></span> | <span class="t">in the Zerp COVID period. You know, it hit a valuation of almost $40 billion.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=799" target="_blank">00:13:19.440</a></span> | <span class="t">They went on to raise subsequent rounds of private financing at a lot lower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=804" target="_blank">00:13:24.240</a></span> | <span class="t">They then went public at just around, I think, $6 billion. So here's the IPO performance chart.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=813" target="_blank">00:13:33.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And here's the valuation trajectory of that business over the course of the last several</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=818" target="_blank">00:13:38.960</a></span> | <span class="t">years. So I think one of the obstacles, right? So it's performed incredibly well.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=823" target="_blank">00:13:43.680</a></span> | <span class="t">Off of the bottom, it's performed really well since the IPO. But it took a board that had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=830" target="_blank">00:13:50.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the courage to say, you know, we're going to ignore what the prior valuations were.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=835" target="_blank">00:13:55.360</a></span> | <span class="t">And we're going to focus on getting the company public. Now, in the case of Instacart, I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=840" target="_blank">00:14:00.320</a></span> | <span class="t">you had, you know, the branding benefits of when they went public. I think they, you know, had</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=845" target="_blank">00:14:05.520</a></span> | <span class="t">access to, you know, to the cash that they needed to invest and grow in the business.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=851" target="_blank">00:14:11.120</a></span> | <span class="t">But, you know, this seems to undermine this argument that, you know, that companies can't</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=856" target="_blank">00:14:16.400</a></span> | <span class="t">do well if they're on the smaller side, you know, post going public. So this is an</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=862" target="_blank">00:14:22.560</a></span> | <span class="t">early indication. But I think that there are a lot of companies in the venture capital pipeline</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=867" target="_blank">00:14:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">bill that look like this, that had these really high marks in '20 and '21. And they need boards</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=875" target="_blank">00:14:35.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and founders and CEOs who have the courage to enter the public market and just accept the new</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=881" target="_blank">00:14:41.040</a></span> | <span class="t">set of marks. And I think this is one of the big psychic or behavioral hurdles to these companies</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=886" target="_blank">00:14:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">getting out and getting into the public markets. Yeah. Yeah. And look, I mean, there are smaller</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=892" target="_blank">00:14:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">companies, you know, like even in the SPAC space, look at him and hers, or look at SoFi,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=899" target="_blank">00:14:59.440</a></span> | <span class="t">Antony Noto. Like they've actually done well over the past six months, like numbers up and to the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=906" target="_blank">00:15:06.400</a></span> | <span class="t">right, stock up and to the right, and much smaller than Instacart. So it is doable. Yeah, I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=914" target="_blank">00:15:14.880</a></span> | <span class="t">you're absolutely right that the structural blocker that comes from having a previous private round</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=922" target="_blank">00:15:22.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is always a problem in these situations.

People just need to kind of bite the bullet and take care of that. There's another</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=932" target="_blank">00:15:32.880</a></span> | <span class="t">thing that happens that relates to that, which is there's this presumption that, oh, well, you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=939" target="_blank">00:15:39.360</a></span> | <span class="t">not, you know, you're not in a good place to be public.

And what I mean by ostrich mentality is someone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=958" target="_blank">00:15:58.800</a></span> | <span class="t">willing to stick their hand, head in the dirt, and not see anything and therefore feel better</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=964" target="_blank">00:16:04.080</a></span> | <span class="t">about themselves. So where I'm going with that is, if you're public, with 100 million in revenue and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=971" target="_blank">00:16:11.920</a></span> | <span class="t">a 10% growth rate, your valuation is not going to be all that great. But guess what? If you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=977" target="_blank">00:16:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">private at 100 million in revenue with a 10% growth rate, it's not like you're better off.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=982" target="_blank">00:16:22.800</a></span> | <span class="t">You're just fooling yourself, right? In fact, because of a lack of liquidity premium,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=990" target="_blank">00:16:30.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you're probably worth less than that public company. And structurally, your cap chart's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=996" target="_blank">00:16:36.720</a></span> | <span class="t">more rigid. And so you have less flexibility. You can't do any acquisition. I mean, there's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1001" target="_blank">00:16:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">all kinds of reasons why that's a worse place to be. But people have this belief that if I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1008" target="_blank">00:16:48.720</a></span> | <span class="t">can see that price and it says $2.33, oh my God, I'm in this horrible place. People have recovered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1017" target="_blank">00:16:57.040</a></span> | <span class="t">from that. So I think we've talked about this before. Here's a chart that we put together</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1025" target="_blank">00:17:05.280</a></span> | <span class="t">that looks at the valuations, the multiples that companies were coming out in different cohorts</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1034" target="_blank">00:17:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">by year. So you can see that the multiples of the companies that came out, not surprisingly,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1041" target="_blank">00:17:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">in '20 and '21 were really high multiples. And then you can see that the companies that have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1046" target="_blank">00:17:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">come out in more recent cohorts are at these much lower multiples. And so I really do think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1052" target="_blank">00:17:32.320</a></span> | <span class="t">it comes down like this is one of the big hurdles that we have. And we saw this after 2006, 2007.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1060" target="_blank">00:17:40.320</a></span> | <span class="t">We had companies funded at really high multiples. I'm thinking even about Zillow or Kayak that were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1067" target="_blank">00:17:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">funded then. And they waited a much longer period of time coming out of 2008, 2009 in order to go</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1074" target="_blank">00:17:54.640</a></span> | <span class="t">public because it took them a while to grow above those multiples. And I think that in that case,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1080" target="_blank">00:18:00.880</a></span> | <span class="t">there were actually ratchets that were in those prior preferred rounds that prevented those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1086" target="_blank">00:18:06.880</a></span> | <span class="t">companies from coming public. That's not the case in most of these deals that were done in '20 and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1091" target="_blank">00:18:11.600</a></span> | <span class="t">'21. And so it seems to me when you look at this chart, the multiples that persist in the public</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1099" target="_blank">00:18:19.360</a></span> | <span class="t">market today, they kind of are the multiples. And so a lot of these companies will be forced</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1104" target="_blank">00:18:24.320</a></span> | <span class="t">into the-- they're either going to have to take a down round in the private markets to have access</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1108" target="_blank">00:18:28.800</a></span> | <span class="t">to cash, or they're going to have to access it by way of the public market. It gets back to your</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1114" target="_blank">00:18:34.640</a></span> | <span class="t">point. There's no hiding from whatever fair value is for these businesses. And now we're talking</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1120" target="_blank">00:18:40.560</a></span> | <span class="t">about businesses here that are doing a couple hundred million in revenue that probably still</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1125" target="_blank">00:18:45.840</a></span> | <span class="t">haven't hit profitability, where growth maybe has started to slow below that 50% annual growth rate.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1133" target="_blank">00:18:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And I think we have over 1,000 of these companies that are marked over a billion dollars</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1139" target="_blank">00:18:59.200</a></span> | <span class="t">that still have to get work through the system.

But to me, we're starting to see the IPO pipeline fill with these companies that I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1155" target="_blank">00:19:15.520</a></span> | <span class="t">will be on the smaller side, that will have growth rates that are still 30%, 40%, 50%</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1160" target="_blank">00:19:20.400</a></span> | <span class="t">superior to public market growth rates. But the valuations will be below, in many cases,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1168" target="_blank">00:19:28.240</a></span> | <span class="t">their last big round of private financing. And by the way, I hope you're right. I mean,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1173" target="_blank">00:19:33.680</a></span> | <span class="t">I hope we see that. We do have a situation where at least the big guys have been pushed away from</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1181" target="_blank">00:19:41.200</a></span> | <span class="t">M&A by regulatory, which is another reason why you need to be more serious about the public option,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1188" target="_blank">00:19:48.000</a></span> | <span class="t">because there are fewer, relative to history, I guess, fewer options on the M&A side.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1193" target="_blank">00:19:53.680</a></span> | <span class="t">And this gets back to the point I was thinking about. There's no hiding place in being private.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1202" target="_blank">00:20:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And I've often said, the minute you took stock options and started handing them to your employees,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1209" target="_blank">00:20:09.360</a></span> | <span class="t">you're in the game, you're on the field.

And the number of people</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=1214" target="_blank">00:20:14.480</a></span> | <span class="t">that make it to the next tier always drops exponentially.

Because this is the same challenge that Amazon faced, which led to the creation of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3172" target="_blank">00:52:52.800</a></span> | <span class="t">AWS.

Like you said with Uber, they have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3192" target="_blank">00:53:12.560</a></span> | <span class="t">natural thing. They can just charge a little bit of peak pricing. They got more people who get out</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3197" target="_blank">00:53:17.680</a></span> | <span class="t">of their houses, drive their cars, pick you up, wait times don't go up that much.

And so Uber gets to take advantage of that and utilize that CapEx. And Tesla may have a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3229" target="_blank">00:53:49.280</a></span> | <span class="t">similar advantage just because they have enough customers.

I don't know how you do it. So let's talk about some of the ways that might</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3264" target="_blank">00:54:24.000</a></span> | <span class="t">happen. As a Tesla owner, if I had the opportunity to put my Tesla in a pool and allow it to be</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3272" target="_blank">00:54:32.240</a></span> | <span class="t">pulled out during peak periods of time for ride share, I'd have a problem with that because I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3277" target="_blank">00:54:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">need my car during those periods of time. Well, it's very likely, here's another way of saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3284" target="_blank">00:54:44.480</a></span> | <span class="t">what you're saying, which is it's very likely that the average Tesla owner's usage map is</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3291" target="_blank">00:54:51.040</a></span> | <span class="t">similar to the Uber map that we just put on the screen. Of course, this is my point. So here would</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3297" target="_blank">00:54:57.600</a></span> | <span class="t">be a straw man. Tesla launches with an owned and operated fleet to prove the model, to start</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3304" target="_blank">00:55:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">building the customer affinity with the product, the customer trust. Which would unquestionably</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3311" target="_blank">00:55:11.520</a></span> | <span class="t">work because there's so many Tesla fans that would want to do it just to be supportive of the team.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3319" target="_blank">00:55:19.840</a></span> | <span class="t">And by the way, it's a great product. It feels great. You probably already have a Tesla,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3324" target="_blank">00:55:24.560</a></span> | <span class="t">so you feel good about FSD. So my hunch is they launch it on... You might even launch it at first</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3331" target="_blank">00:55:31.040</a></span> | <span class="t">with only allowing Tesla owners or something like that. Oh, interesting. It's almost like a benefit</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3337" target="_blank">00:55:37.600</a></span> | <span class="t">of ownership. So then I think what they do is, my hunch is that they will open it up and partner</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3346" target="_blank">00:55:46.080</a></span> | <span class="t">with Uber. I think Uber would like that. I think Tesla would like it. And here's my argument for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3352" target="_blank">00:55:52.960</a></span> | <span class="t">that. The only way you solve the peak demand problem, Bill, is that you have to basically</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3362" target="_blank">00:56:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">have high utilization at lower periods of demand. You have to reduce the delta between your trough</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3369" target="_blank">00:56:09.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and your peak. And the way you do that is you pull in the Uber demand when your demand is lower.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3376" target="_blank">00:56:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">And so an example of that would be, if you think about in the city of New York,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3381" target="_blank">00:56:21.760</a></span> | <span class="t">McDonald's has an app. You can go on the McDonald's app and you can order a burger,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3386" target="_blank">00:56:26.320</a></span> | <span class="t">right? Or you can go on the Uber Eats app or the DoorDash app and order a burger. And so</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3394" target="_blank">00:56:34.480</a></span> | <span class="t">McDonald's recognizes that they want to try to flatten that demand out over the course of the day.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3400" target="_blank">00:56:40.720</a></span> | <span class="t">And so they can yield manage that by having both a 3P and a 1P strategy. So it seems to me that the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3407" target="_blank">00:56:47.600</a></span> | <span class="t">only way you really crack this is have a 3P and 1P strategy. And the upside to that, in addition,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3414" target="_blank">00:56:54.800</a></span> | <span class="t">is that now you have a flywheel of Uber drivers potentially building some mini fleets of their</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3423" target="_blank">00:57:03.760</a></span> | <span class="t">own.

So I think they probably launch it on a standalone</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3450" target="_blank">00:57:30.160</a></span> | <span class="t">basis. They get a lot of excitement and a lot of customer love for it. But my sense is, by the time</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3455" target="_blank">00:57:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">you scale this, it probably does have to be an open system. We'll see. Yeah. And I mean, that's</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3460" target="_blank">00:57:40.640</a></span> | <span class="t">clearly up to the powers that be at Tesla to make that decision. The two companies have partnered</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3466" target="_blank">00:57:46.880</a></span> | <span class="t">to date already. They have quite a number of initiatives, including like free charging for</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3473" target="_blank">00:57:53.760</a></span> | <span class="t">people that buy them and put them on.

But,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3478" target="_blank">00:57:58.720</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, as as this plays out, we may see, you know, reasons why they may not want to.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3484" target="_blank">00:58:04.720</a></span> | <span class="t">Can we talk a little bit just about the unit economics, you know, of these different businesses?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3490" target="_blank">00:58:10.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Yeah, there's one thing I want to bring up specifically that that'll be interesting to</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3496" target="_blank">00:58:16.560</a></span> | <span class="t">see how it plays out.

How long do you</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3711" target="_blank">01:01:51.680</a></span> | <span class="t">think it takes the California state regulator to pass along an insurance increase, right?

So we went from a period where the auto insurance were not charging</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3737" target="_blank">01:02:17.040</a></span> | <span class="t">enough because they had to beg the state regulators and they were slow, and now they're charging too</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3741" target="_blank">01:02:21.440</a></span> | <span class="t">much. But set that aside for a second. Let's come back to the unit economic. And by the way, I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3746" target="_blank">01:02:26.720</a></span> | <span class="t">this cost, this is a lot of guesswork. I apologize. People should treat it as such. But I think in the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3753" target="_blank">01:02:33.280</a></span> | <span class="t">Uber case in the US, about 5% of gross revenue goes to insurance. Yeah. So it's an expensive</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3761" target="_blank">01:02:41.840</a></span> | <span class="t">input. And we took a crack. Okay. So let's just say at the high level, most people think that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3767" target="_blank">01:02:47.440</a></span> | <span class="t">taking the driver out of the Uber will lead to an explosion in profit margins because it represents</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3773" target="_blank">01:02:53.840</a></span> | <span class="t">70% or 75% of the cost of the ride. But we actually took a crack at these unit economics. And what I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3783" target="_blank">01:03:03.040</a></span> | <span class="t">think that fails to understand is a couple of things. Number one, if you just break this down</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3788" target="_blank">01:03:08.400</a></span> | <span class="t">per car, we estimate that there's about $140,000 of revenue per car driven on the Uber network. Now,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3796" target="_blank">01:03:16.080</a></span> | <span class="t">of course, this is blended across tons of different markets, tons of different cars, etc.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3800" target="_blank">01:03:20.480</a></span> | <span class="t">So $140,000 of GBV. When you do that in self-driving, we think it goes down to about $100,000. Why?</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3807" target="_blank">01:03:27.840</a></span> | <span class="t">Well, you have actually more rides in the self-driven car, right? But it actually comes</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3813" target="_blank">01:03:33.840</a></span> | <span class="t">in at a lower cost because you put so many cars on the road that the charge to the consumer gets</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3820" target="_blank">01:03:40.240</a></span> | <span class="t">shared back with the consumer, right? Margins come down as you have more competition because you have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3824" target="_blank">01:03:44.880</a></span> | <span class="t">more cars on the road. Next up, the revenue per car. Well, of course, you take out 70% of the cost,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3833" target="_blank">01:03:53.040</a></span> | <span class="t">the driver cost, on the driver-driven car. So at a revenue level, we think that if you were</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3841" target="_blank">01:04:01.360</a></span> | <span class="t">comparing apples for apples, in the case of the one with a driver, they make about $40,000 a car.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3849" target="_blank">01:04:09.920</a></span> | <span class="t">Without the driver, they would make about $90,000 per car. This is just revenue.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3854" target="_blank">01:04:14.560</a></span> | <span class="t">So about double the revenue. But the costs are way higher in the full self-driving case.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3861" target="_blank">01:04:21.120</a></span> | <span class="t">Obviously, first up is you have to pay for the car, right? There are massive costs associated</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3866" target="_blank">01:04:26.400</a></span> | <span class="t">with that.

It's not viable. So that car would need to get down towards this $30,000 number for that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=3914" target="_blank">01:05:14.720</a></span> | <span class="t">disruption to matter.

In fact, I think if it works for Tesla, I think there's an opportunity</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=4033" target="_blank">01:07:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">for both companies.

Remember this deal that Tesla entered into</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=4071" target="_blank">01:07:51.920</a></span> | <span class="t">with Hertz where Hertz bought a bunch of Teslas?

I think</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=4082" target="_blank">01:08:02.160</a></span> | <span class="t">the write down for Hertz was like a billion dollars over this mis-forecast. So if you're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=4088" target="_blank">01:08:08.160</a></span> | <span class="t">in the business of buying and maintaining that fleet on behalf of Tesla, you're doing so with</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=4093" target="_blank">01:08:13.840</a></span> | <span class="t">full knowledge that all of this is hard to forecast.

And just the anecdote I shared from last night, I am more convinced than I ever have</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=4144" target="_blank">01:09:04.320</a></span> | <span class="t">that we're going to see tons of cars on the roads with no drivers in the years ahead.

And he said, over the course of the next three years, we'll grow our top line 50%,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=4527" target="_blank">01:15:27.360</a></span> | <span class="t">and we'll reduce our personnel costs by 10% to 20%, right? That's extraordinary. Like,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=4534" target="_blank">01:15:34.960</a></span> | <span class="t">I don't think we've had a moment like the moment we have today in terms of margin expansion,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=4540" target="_blank">01:15:40.960</a></span> | <span class="t">right, in any time frame that I can remember where it was voluntary. It's not because we're</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=4547" target="_blank">01:15:47.920</a></span> | <span class="t">in a recession, it's not, but it's because companies really do see the opportunity,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=4553" target="_blank">01:15:53.120</a></span> | <span class="t">both they had some, you know, they have room to cut because they got excessive in 20 and 21,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=4559" target="_blank">01:15:59.680</a></span> | <span class="t">and because they now have these tools, co-pilots, soon to be co-workers in engineering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=4564" target="_blank">01:16:04.800</a></span> | <span class="t">that enable them to be more productive, more efficient in engineering,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=4568" target="_blank">01:16:08.800</a></span> | <span class="t">and also allow them to be much more efficient. And that includes Slack and Zoom and things that</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=4576" target="_blank">01:16:16.160</a></span> | <span class="t">allow people to have more employees outside of the Bay Area. I mean, every one of these CEOs</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=4582" target="_blank">01:16:22.400</a></span> | <span class="t">I talked to are intentionally trying to get headcount out of the Bay Area.</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=4588" target="_blank">01:16:28.640</a></span> | <span class="t">Which, in response to our SBC pod that we did, I had a, you know, a CEO of a major</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=4595" target="_blank">01:16:35.120</a></span> | <span class="t">company call me and say, "Hey, we're rebalancing how we're thinking about SBC, you know, across</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=4602" target="_blank">01:16:42.320</a></span> | <span class="t">the business." And I said, "Doesn't that make you nervous that you'll lose your best engineers,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=4606" target="_blank">01:16:46.960</a></span> | <span class="t">you know, if the total cost of SBC comes down?"

The labor market for engineers is softening. It's easy for us to keep and retain</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4BQCaVMjg4&t=4618" target="_blank">01:16:58.880</a></span> | <span class="t">the best talent.
