I have one from Katie. Katie says, "I know thinking deep is a thought or work process of younger adults, but how about addressing the older population? Retirees like myself have lots of time on their hands. And really, after you've worked so long in one profession, you don't know what to do with so much time.</p><p>I'd like to learn Spanish or be more productive, but who knows in what? And how does deep thinking become a process in our life?" Well Katie, earlier in this show, we did this question a few times. And what I would often come back to is for people who are later in life who are retiring or have retired, the deep life bucket method becomes very important.</p><p>Now go watch my video on the deep life core idea, youtube.com/CalNewportMedia. Watch that video to get brought up to speed on what the deep life bucket method is. But there is fewer circumstances where this method is more effective than for people who are retired. Because what it's going to force you to do is look at the different elements of your life that are important.</p><p>And then for each of those, get rid of the noise and boost the signal. Get rid of the junk that's not returning you much and put in place habits and endeavors that are really giving you a high return on time investment. And when you're retired, you have a lot more time to invest.</p><p>So this process becomes more exciting. But the bucket method where you're breaking up your life into these different parts prevents you from having capture in just one element of your life or from getting too lost in minutia. It gives you some structure to this whole process. So I think it's one of the exciting things about retirement is you can re-engineer your life in this systematic way.</p><p>And you have so much more levers to pull and knobs to turn than say someone who is up to their ears midlife at a peak of their career trajectory, which is eating up all their time and every minute that remains is wrangling kids. I mean, you now have the promised land, Katie, which is some some room to actually do some cool things with your life.</p><p>So go go listen to that. Watch that video. I'd say not listen, but watch that video on the deep life. The bucket method will help organize your efforts going forward.</p></div></div></body></html>
