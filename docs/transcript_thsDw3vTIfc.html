I've actually heard people booking travel, redeeming the points to credit it off and then canceling it if it's a refundable airfare and then still being able to keep the points. But I don't think it would be that hard to make sure that however much you spend on the card, you put four and a half percent of your spending into the travel</p></div></div></body></html>
