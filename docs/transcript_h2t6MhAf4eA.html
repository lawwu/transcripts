Moses didn't see people. He saw bridges. He saw highways. He saw tunnels. He saw rivers. He saw the city as a giant traffic problem. Jane Jacobs, who was a person without portfolio most of her life, except of her own powers of judgment and persuasion, she thought, "Well, what does the shoe repairman got to do with the grocery store, got to do with the school, got to do with something else?" She saw what Moses didn't see.</p><p>She saw the intricacies of the city. He saw a giant landscape. She saw the block, just the block.</p></div></div></body></html>
