You know, what if we were to take the things that humans do to create new technologies that have transformed the planet so radically, and we were able to completely automate them so that every computer we have is potentially another mind working on advancing technology.</p><p>So either way you think about it, you could imagine the world changing incredibly quickly and incredibly dramatically. It looks reasonably likely, in my opinion, more than 50/50, that this century we'll see AI systems that can do all of the key tasks that humans do to advance science and technology.</p><p>And that if that happens, we'll see explosive progress in science and technology. The world will quickly become extremely different from how it is today. You might think of it as if there was thousands of years of changes packed into a much shorter time period. And then if that happens, I argue that you could end up in a deeply unfamiliar future.</p></div></div></body></html>
