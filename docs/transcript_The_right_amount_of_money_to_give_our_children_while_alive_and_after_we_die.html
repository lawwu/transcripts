In this episode I have with me my wife, Sydney. How are you? Hi everybody, good morning. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening. In this episode we're going to talk about the right amount of money to give our adult children while we are alive and after we die.</p><p>I've been thinking about this topic more and more recently as our children grow older and older. I talked to other parents and try to hear their thoughts on the strategic planning. Then I see my neighbor who is now 30 years old and still living with his parents because his parents gave him everything.</p><p>He's got nice cars, he's got a motorbike and he hasn't left the house since spending six years in college for now six years now. So we've seen him since 2014 and he's still there living at home and that just kind of bums me out. I would think that every parent's hope is that their child launches, finds something they'd love to do in their career, finds something they love to do in their life and find love.</p><p>I mean what are your thoughts? Right, I mean we have seen him. The only positive thing I will say is that it does seem like he has consistently gone to a job five days a week because he would start his motorbike up at eight o'clock every morning. We were awake but it would be kind of annoying to hear that noise.</p><p>We don't know what job he's been to but at least he consistently seems to have some form of employment which is good for him. I know what he does. I don't want to say anything but it's nothing like you're like wow you went to college for six years to do that.</p><p>So come on folks this is a new era. People really have to think about how much they spend their time and money on education, what they want to do. Things are difficult now. Yeah. So I'm trying to come up with a framework on how much to give our children while living because before we had children I always thought man parents giving kids cars, houses, you know stipends while they're already adults seems kind of weak.</p><p>Weak sauce. But now as we're parents it seems like okay it's better to give our children money while we're alive. It makes us feel better and it helps them when they need the money the most than after we're dead and when they're like 50 plus years old. What are your thoughts?</p><p>I think it's a great idea to contribute while we're alive versus only after death. Being able to do both is obviously great too. Tell me about the conversation you had with your friend on the tennis court about this. Well I just had I was just hitting with a friend and he's a very successful fund manager and he was saying well I should probably set up about 10 million dollars for my son because what if he just wants to be a college professor and make 150,000 a year.</p><p>Like that would be tough for his family to survive if his spouse or the son's spouse didn't work. Oh wow that's that's quite aggressive. I mean that seems pretty aggressive but then if we talk about the 0.5 percent rule which I discussed and where there's so much backlash 10 million at 0.5 percent withdrawal rate is uh what is that 50,000 dollars because 10 percent of 10 million is 1 million 1 percent of 10 million is 100,000 so yeah 50,000 dollars.</p><p>So now that rates are so low right you know the file the goal post has moved so much hey maybe 10 million maybe that's a reasonable amount because that's only generating 15,000 a year. If perhaps the son doesn't know it's that big. Right because I think if if our kids knew that they were going to get 10 million dollars.</p><p>If anybody knew they were going to get 10 million dollars they wouldn't be motivated to. That's true but the funny thing is in 20 years 10 million dollars will maybe will be worth maybe six million dollars seven million dollars and that's kind of one of the fallacies of people saying oh I want to be a millionaire and make you know one million dollars or have a net worth of one million dollars.</p><p>Back in 1945 if you're a millionaire that was big balling. Oh yeah the needle's always moving. And so now if you were to compound that one million just by the rate of inflation from 1945 to 2020 that million is worth more like 14 to 15 million. Yeah. But that's the thing so if you're gonna leave your kid 10 million dollars that that just seems out of control ridiculous.</p><p>Well not very many people would even have the option or the right ability to leave that much. So we're kind of like maybe wasting time talking about this this level of income and wealth. So let's talk about the right amount to give while living. I believe that we should follow kind of the tax guidelines and give the exclusion amount the gift tax exclusion amount.</p><p>Yeah I think that makes a lot of sense. So for 2020 the gift tax exclusion amount is 15,000 a year. In other words every time you give 15,000 you lower your estate amount by 15,000 which means on the back end when you die you don't have to pay the death tax on 15,000 or any of that gift tax exclusion.</p><p>I think you made a good point in your post though that you don't want or I wouldn't want our kids to get dependent on expecting a set amount of money every single year. So you had mentioned something about doing it every three years. Right so I think giving every three years the gift tax exclusion amount seems pretty good because if it's every year then it feels like income and then you just expect it right.</p><p>And the gift tax exclusion amount is per person so both of us can each give 15,000 to each child so 30,000 a year. So once you start giving 30,000 a year that's a lot. It's like why bother working 30,000 especially if we give them you know a place to stay and all that you just why bother doing anything.</p><p>Yeah it's too much. It's too much so if you want to give 30,000 I say you know you can give that maybe once every six years which is mathematically equivalent to giving 15,000 every three years. One thing I'm thinking about regarding the gift tax exclusion amount is since only one percent of people have an estate worth over 10 million dollars why are we even bothering with the gift tax exclusion amount.</p><p>Right like okay so if you die with five million which is still a lot of money you're still 6.58 million away from the estate tax threshold to pay that 40% death tax so who really cares. I don't understand why people are focusing so much on the gift tax. I guess maybe it's because they think that that amount won't last so long.</p><p>It does have a deadline I forget what it is. It's still in the future but you know anything is possible it could get changed. That's true that's true good point like historically that estate tax threshold amount was down to like a million dollars just several years ago and of course it depends on the government laws and so forth.</p><p>So that's true I mean to expect the estate tax threshold to continue going from 11.58 million per person you know to 12 to 13 to 20 I mean it's probably going to cap out at some point. Yeah. So good point. All right so beyond just giving the gift tax exclusion amount every three to six years the other big thing I've noticed at least here in San Francisco is that for first-time homebuyers I think it's like 60% I surveyed a lot of realtors 60% of first-time homebuyers have some type of help from their parents whether it's partial help or the full 10 or 20% down payment.</p><p>What do you think about that? I think adult kids who have parents who are able to help them afford their first home in an expensive city like San Francisco is a very fortunate thing. You know it's it's tough I think every set of parents has to look at their adult children individually and see how motivated they are you know how involved they are with the parents.</p><p>Right. You know one thing the parents of the adult kids could do is have the adult kids contribute some sort of mortgage payment or I don't know make sure that they're involved somehow whether it's paying the property tax or taking their parents to the doctor you know just doing something to make sure they're not just receiving and not...</p><p>Free riding? Free riding yeah there you go. So that is a good point in terms of being involved in the parents lives not like disappearing for five years or being a deadbeat after college and like hey mom and dad can I have some money? Right. You know forget that and some of the commenters did say well it might be more about timing instead of the amount given.</p><p>So one parent was saying I think I'll know by the time my kid is in middle school or in high school whether he or she is on the ball empathetic sympathetic caring hardworking and knows the value of a dollar and if that kid does know all that stuff and has all those great attributes okay we're gonna adjust the giving amount accordingly as well as the time frame and if not it's like no wow why would we give our spoiled kid who doesn't listen who doesn't try hard anything but the irony on that and that is they might need more help because they don't listen.</p><p>I know. How do you figure that out? It's hard for parents especially who have multiple children with varying degrees of personalities and you know you know strong differences in personality because you don't want your one of your children to feel that they're you know left out or that they're overly favored but hey that's parenting that's no it's not easy.</p><p>It's not easy and then a lot of parents have gone the default route and said we are going to divide our estate equally among our children but come on if you raise a very successful child who is financially independent by whatever whatever age well what are you going to split the estate equally for but then on the flip side that you want to reward them right?</p><p>It's like it's kind of like taxes it's like the harder you work the more you get taxed so why bother yeah that that is interesting and so you know I've talked to my parents and they said well we're just splitting it evenly it doesn't really matter how hard you work or whatever or how often you call me or it's just equal.</p><p>Yeah my my parents had the same thing they they didn't want us to feel that they loved or cared for one of us more than the other. What they actually felt who knows. Right we all secretly. I have heard some opinionated comments from my mom but I won't get about your family politics.</p><p>Sibling. And you know I won't raise that on this podcast. Right. But yeah it's families can be very complex. Right and it it just is terrible how sometimes money can tear apart family relationships. Yes it definitely can it's unfortunate. It's terrible it's terrible terrible. All right Sam so tell me what your thoughts are on leaving a house to our kids or helping them out with down payment.</p><p>So when I was in my 20s I had a lot of peers get gifted a house or a condo by their parents and frankly I was jealous you know one day they'd be like oh welcome to my housewarming party. It's a two bedroom you know two bathroom condominium on the Upper East Side.</p><p>I was like what how do you afford seven hundred fifty thousand dollars on our very mediocre forty thousand dollar salary in Manhattan. And the answer is the parents either paid for the down payment or paid all cash for the place. And that was something that really got me motivated to try to maybe one day do that for my children.</p><p>And again this is over 20 years ago and also kind of fired me up to try harder just to save and invest more money. And I don't know if it's a good idea. On the one hand it's a reward. OK. They got a job at a really reputable firm at the time.</p><p>And so the parents are like well we have excess money. We're going to help you buy a place in Manhattan instead of spend on rent. Why not. And those apartments those condos have really appreciated in value since 1999 2000 they're up three X. And so the rich got richer.</p><p>They're winning. And so in the beginning I was definitely a little bit jealous. But over time I realized that actually makes a lot of sense especially if your kids are if our kids are going to end up in a big city that's more expensive than the median in the country.</p><p>And if they can't buy a property for the age of 30. That's that's going to be tougher I think. But that's also normal. Why should they have everything. So I don't know. It's tough for me to think about it. The way I'm thinking about right now is why not try to invest in real estate now.</p><p>And then 20 to 30 years from now our kids will be like wow dad mom you bought real estate 20 to 30 years ago for such a great price. Good job. Because think about all of us when we think man our grandparents could have bought property for what price 60 years ago.</p><p>That's crazy. And the bottom line is it's inflation. Inflation is is too hard of a force to go against. So let me ask you this question. Let's say you did that and your child has one of these great properties in an expensive city. And then they decide that they're going to move and they're going to sell that house or that condo for a great profit.</p><p>Yeah. Now what would you expect as the parent. Would you let them sell it. Would you not let them sell it. If they sold it would you expect them to return some of the money to you. What do you think about that. That's actually a good question. So I've been old holding it and paying property taxes and doing all that for 30 years and then they inherit it and they want to sell it a year later while I'm still alive.</p><p>No. No. You're not going to do that. You might. OK. If you want to do that you want to relinquish this property this great asset that generates awesome cash flow given it's been purchased 30 years ago and there's no mortgage and all that. Well maybe you can get one 30th of the income or the equity.</p><p>Maybe right. If if it's 30 years old maybe. But the point of these assets is to provide a perpetual income stream especially in a low interest rate environment. I'm not sure if people truly realize how much more valuable these income generating assets are. For example real estate income online income whatever asset you own that generates income has become much more valuable because interest rates and the risk free rate and so forth have declined so tremendously.</p><p>Right. 0.5 percent or 0.7 percent on the 10 year bond yield. It doesn't yield that much income anymore. So if you actually have an asset that yields a much higher yield then it's much more valuable. But I think the market is not not really recognizing that this therein lies the opportunity.</p><p>So back to your question specifically again I think we also have to have a conversation. Have a conversation. Where are risk assets now where where's the risk free rate of return. You know what are your financial goals and so forth. So maybe it's important that if you're going to gift or help your children with a house or any kind of property to consider who's on the title.</p><p>Consider who's on the title. Yeah. So if it's on our title then ultimately it's our decision. So it's just kind of accounting. Well it's not accounting. It's here son daughter here's the house. But it's actually under my name so too bad you can't do anything. You can enjoy it.</p><p>You can manage it. You can earn the income. But if you want to you know try to sell it and rip it out. Yeah too bad. Too bad. OK. So once we've provided education some living subsidies maybe a down payment for a house maybe graduate school maybe I don't know.</p><p>Is graduate school necessary in 20 years. I don't even know if college is really necessary in 20 years. Ultimately it depends on what career path you're going to take. Right. Doctor dentist lawyer education is absolutely essential for those types of careers. You don't want to go to your doctor.</p><p>I'm an expert. No no. Yeah that's not good. Yes. More education the better if we're talking about a doctor. Maybe. You know I got a good idea. Why don't we create a master's degree for personal finance blogging. Yeah that could be good right. Yeah. I mean come on money is very important.</p><p>Very important but it doesn't seem like you need to have any kind of formal financial training to talk about money which is fine. You know we can just treat it as entertainment. Yeah. You make some money you lose some money you start all over in life. That's fine. But anyway.</p><p>OK. Back on topic. So tell me once we provide the basics education food clothing subsidized shelter should we provide even more money. I think you know we could help support the kids in different ways. Doesn't have to be actual dollars in their bank account or assets. One idea I thought about was taking a radical family vacation with the adult kids.</p><p>You know it's hard to be involved with our. What do you think is funny. A radical. What do you say a radical family vacation. Well not just. What is a radical family vacation. I don't know. Just something adventurous that's not just you know going to the beach. Oh I love going to the beach.</p><p>I know going to the beach. But I'm talking about like radical like skydiving. No. OK. More all inclusive fun vacation. That's really about bonding. So if let's say the global pandemic goes away and people aren't scared to travel anymore. So going to a new country together experiencing a new culture.</p><p>Yeah. Something like that. You know where you takes a lot of planning and it costs a lot to go to Jordan or. Yeah. And it's as adults we're busy. It's hard to dedicate time to spend with our parents especially if they live far away. Right. Yeah. So I really hope.</p><p>Bringing them together. Pay for their flights. We're older and our kids are older that they'll want to be involved with us. And I think. Yeah. You know having a really fun vacation to look forward to. Yes. Would be a really cool way to have an experience together as a family and pay for it.</p><p>OK. Or pay for a lot of it. The other idea is to help subsidize the cost of grandkids. Yeah. So whether that's contributing to the 5 to 9 plan every year. I think that's mainly it. Right. Contributing to their education fund. Yeah. That's something that you know 15000 a year 10.</p><p>Whatever even 5000 dollars. Something is nice. And that's that's something that I think a lot of grandparents would enjoy doing. Right. So tell me your thoughts about giving money to children after. Well after we're dead it kind of doesn't really matter. Hopefully we live long enough so that our kids are adults.</p><p>They have their own families. They have their own money and so forth. So hopefully our kids are over the age of 50 when we die. And so by that point I don't think our mannerisms the way we see money or spend money changes once we're 50 years old. I'm just think about I'm just think about my my parents.</p><p>They're still super frugal. They don't have any debt. They've got a pension but they still go to early birth specials. They still don't change the lamp fixture outside the house because they're afraid that once they change or they don't they don't turn the light on because they don't want to change the lamp fixture because the lamp fixture is a pain in the butt to change and also cost money.</p><p>Right. So I just think old habits die hard. So even if we leave our kids tens of millions of dollars when they're 50 plus if we raise them right if we've kept in touch with them they're going to do what's best I think for themselves and for society with the money we leave behind.</p><p>Yeah. All right. That concludes this episode. If you enjoyed the episode we'd love a positive review and a rating. It keeps us going. We're gonna have more and more of these couple dialogues because I think it's just so fun to catch up and hopefully one day our kids will look back in August 2020 or September 2020 and be like Mom Dad what were you guys thinking.</p><p>It'll be really fun. All right. Thanks so much everyone. Talk to you later. Bye.</p></div></div></body></html>
