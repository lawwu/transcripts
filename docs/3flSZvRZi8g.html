So many of these finance questions are useful if</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=158" target="_blank">00:02:38.400</a></span> | <span class="t">you know how to apply them to your circumstances, right? I started my career in the institutional</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=161" target="_blank">00:02:41.400</a></span> | <span class="t">asset management business. I worked with nonprofits who had portfolios of hundreds of thousands of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=165" target="_blank">00:02:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">dollars, millions of dollars, sometimes tens of millions of dollars, hundreds of millions,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=169" target="_blank">00:02:49.200</a></span> | <span class="t">up to a billion dollars, right? So the circumstances were different for each of these organizations,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=173" target="_blank">00:02:53.800</a></span> | <span class="t">depending on the size of their portfolio. But there were still plenty of similarities to how</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=177" target="_blank">00:02:57.560</a></span> | <span class="t">we manage the portfolios, right? Each investment plan looked at the organization's risk profile</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=181" target="_blank">00:03:01.160</a></span> | <span class="t">and time horizon and spending needs, and then created an asset allocation based on those</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=184" target="_blank">00:03:04.960</a></span> | <span class="t">premises, right? So the way I saw it is the investment philosophy is universal. The strategy</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=190" target="_blank">00:03:10.360</a></span> | <span class="t">is just personal. So I always thought, like, the billion dollar or hundred million dollar</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=194" target="_blank">00:03:14.120</a></span> | <span class="t">portfolios, it was just an extra zero. You still have to think of investing the same way. And I</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=197" target="_blank">00:03:17.800</a></span> | <span class="t">think that the personal finance topics are the same thing. Sure, this person has $6 million,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=202" target="_blank">00:03:22.280</a></span> | <span class="t">and maybe you only have $60,000 saved in your IRA, but they're still thinking about a lot of</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=207" target="_blank">00:03:27.760</a></span> | <span class="t">the same things. Sure, your financial life becomes a little more complicated, and we have more money,</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=212" target="_blank">00:03:32.200</a></span> | <span class="t">and maybe there's some other strategies on the edges that you have to think about. But the big</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=216" target="_blank">00:03:36.400</a></span> | <span class="t">questions, the behavioral stuff, getting the big building block stuff right is still exactly the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=222" target="_blank">00:03:42.040</a></span> | <span class="t">same, no matter how much money you have. I've always thought that. And so what you're saying</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=225" target="_blank">00:03:45.280</a></span> | <span class="t">is go back and watch all of our old episodes if you haven't yet.

It</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=250" target="_blank">00:04:10.520</a></span> | <span class="t">seemed the consensus was against the early mortgage payments. Well, I have a 6% five-year auto loan on</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=256" target="_blank">00:04:16.040</a></span> | <span class="t">a truck that I use to haul a camper, which I live in full time.

This one sounds like a "House Hunters" episode. I like this one though. So the</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=285" target="_blank">00:04:45.320</a></span> | <span class="t">auto loan is different from a mortgage because we're dealing with different time frames and</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=288" target="_blank">00:04:48.200</a></span> | <span class="t">different financial assets, right?

I think the good rule of thumb is the minute you drive it off the lot, an automobile</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=300" target="_blank">00:05:00.160</a></span> | <span class="t">is going to be worth 10% less.

Housing is a form of consumption that I think has similarities to a</span></div><div class="c"><span class="s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3flSZvRZi8g&t=313" target="_blank">00:05:13.360</a></span> | <span class="t">financial asset.
