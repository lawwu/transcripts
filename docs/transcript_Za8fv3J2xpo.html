And so I get these like, oh, here's this offer where you buy a meal kit and the discount basically makes it $5, but you get thousands of loyalty points. And a part of me just really wants to play this game.</p><p>And then a part of me thinks it's absolutely crazy because I never fly American. So I'm going to address my own problems after I run through this inventory. But I figured it's kind of helpful to hear where all these statuses came from, how I ended up with them, because they do provide a ton of benefit.</p><p>When you have a lot of statuses, you're boarding early, you're earning more points, you're not paying for check bags, all kinds of things like that. I am happy I have them. I just think to some extent, it's a little crazy, given that we're not flying that often. On the flip side, I really love it.</p><p>And it's kind of a game. So if I treat it from that perspective, then it's really interesting.</p></div></div></body></html>
